Mouth to mouth resuscitation,"It might be the best way to save someone in distress.
But it doesn’t scale.
You can only offer this sort of lifesaving intervention to one person at a time.
Often, we get stuck because we try to take our useful local magic and somehow make it for everyone. Perhaps we’ll need a different approach when it comes to serving more people.
Not because it doesn’t work. It does. Because it doesn’t work at scale.","May 8, 2021","resuscitation, scalability, intervention"
"Shortages, momentum and the search for meaning","A general malaise is not new. Sociologists have been writing about it since the Second World War. Today, of course, the malaise isn’t simply general, it’s also specific.
There’s too much pain and disconnection and uncertainty in the world. And yet, there are technological marvels, new opportunities and many people who have enough resources to meet their needs. For someone with enough, two things can get in the way of a life filled with meaning:
Affluence and stasis.
When we don’t have enough to eat, don’t have a roof over our heads, don’t have something that we need and can imagine getting, it’s not a general malaise, it’s a specific one. If you’re in this position, life is hard indeed.
On the other hand, spoiled kids are spoiled by parents who have already figured out how to cover their basic needs. When people stop focusing on making a contribution or wrestling with urgency, it’s easy for them to feel a sense of ennui.
And stasis is the feeling that nothing much is going to improve.
In wartime London, under attack eighty years ago, food was scarce and life was dangerous. But those that survived recall it as being a great moment (even if it was something that they’d very much like to avoid repeating).
Compare this to the widespread dissatisfaction described by people who grew up expecting things to get better (momentum) who are now coming to the conclusion that it might not happen.
“Compared to what,” is the question that gets asked at work and home every day, and if the ‘what’ is yesterday, it’s difficult to keep a positive promise forever. Day trading on better is a rough ride.
As we enter a post-industrial economy where good jobs are going to continue to get more scarce, creating a positive cultural dynamic-one in which the social contract can deliver meaning-is more urgent than ever.
The constant awareness that’s pumped in via the media rarely matches the experiences (positive or negative, exciting or not) that many people choose to experience every day. That mismatch often translates into unhappiness.","May 7, 2021","malaise, meaning, disconnection"
The benefit of the doubt,"Rarely talked about, and the heart of marketing and more than that, of culture.
We can’t possibly know precisely what’s inside the book or the box or the bottle before we buy it for the first time. We take meds or go to the movies in anticipation of an outcome, and we give the producer the benefit of the doubt (or we don’t go, because the doubt is too much for us to handle.)
And we do the same thing with people. Who we hire, who we are afraid of, who we marry. We can’t know, not for sure, not until our experience with them is complete.
And we make all of these decisions without a conscious thought.
When we persistently and consistently do it incorrectly, we suffer. We create injustice, we miss out on opportunities, we fall prey to scams. The more we generalize our benefit of the doubt (and worse, the amplification of the doubt) the more damage we do.
The internet has overwhelmed us with data, and some of it (but not much) is actually turned into useful information. Some of that useful information is helping us see how long we’ve been mistaken about the benefit of the doubt in so many of the biases and actions we take (and don’t take).
Examining how we instinctually make these choices is a powerful first step in making better ones.","May 6, 2021","benefit of the doubt, biases, decision making"
The weather problem,"Meteorologists on TV spend most of their time talking about how the weather is right now, right outside. And progress for TV weather often looks like more accurate reporting of the current precipitation, temperature and windspeed, along with nicer graphics.
That’s not the same as actually predicting what the weather will be tomorrow. We can probably agree that more granularity in how the weather is right now isn’t particularly interesting.
It’s an easy trap to fall into, because spending time on what’s provably true is way less risky than deciding what’s important and using it to predict the future.
Our best work involves sorting the important from the rest, along with bringing a point of view and experience to complicated problems. Problems that are interesting because there isn’t a proven, correct answer.
The wind chill factor is best left to an automated device.
We don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows, but figuring out how it’s going to blow tomorrow is a great skill.","May 5, 2021","Weather prediction, Meteorology, Current conditions"
“But how will you know?”,"It pays to know what something is for. It helps us figure out how to do it better, how to allocate resources and how to know when we’re done.
Much of what we build or invest in is complicated. It serves multiple purposes, has to please many constituents and has competing priorities.
So the question: “How will we know if it’s working?” is a powerful one.
It opens the door to a useful conversation about what it’s for.","May 4, 2021","purpose, evaluation, complexity"
An alternative to hustle,"No one wants to be hustled. To be pitched and pushed and most of all, pressured into buying something. Hustle culture has been around for a long time, but the internet–and new forms of it in particular–seems to amplify the feeling.
Three elements of hustle stand out for me:
The folks at Akimbo (an independent B corp) have been quietly building a series of interactive workshops that help people build value and show up in the marketplace without hustle. By doing good work that you can be proud of.
Here’s what they’ve got coming up:
The flagshipaltMBAhas already helped more than 5,000 people transform their careers and their lives. The Regular Decision Deadline is tomorrow, May 4th for altMBA’s July 2021 session.
Ramon Ray’sThe Small Business Workshopstarts tomorrow, May 4th, and you can enroll now. It’s back for its third session.
Real Skills, a one-day non-conference is happening on May 14th (tickets available now). No speakers, no Powerpoints, simply small-group interaction designed to change the way you and your team create possibility. This is the fifth session, and many people have done it more than once.
TheCreative’s Workshop, session four, starts in a few weeks and enrollment is open now. In this workshop (which led to my bookThe Practice), you’ll learn to find your voice and ship work you care about. Now in its fourth session, participants have been amazed at how deep and wide this work can go, and how powerful the connections created within cohorts can be.
And bestselling author Bernadette Jiwa is back with the seventh session of theStory Skills Workshop. This is an essential foundation for anyone seeking to be heard, to make a difference and to engage with people to make change happen. Bernadette’s breakthrough approach is proven to be effective. You can check it out today.
When you’re ready to level up, it’s possible to learn to make a bigger impact.","May 3, 2021","hustle culture, workshops, personal development"
When it doesn’t work out,"Possibility has a flipside.
We need possibility to do our best work. To believe that it might work. To understand that if we do our best work and bring our full selves to the project, we have a shot at achieving our goal. Hope is fuel.
Perhaps we’ll make the sale, be admitted, create a hit, change someone’s mind, invent a breakthrough, play the notes beautifully, open doors and create magic…
But we might not.
And if we don’t, what then?
The first opportunity is to learn from what happened. That possibility was there, but we guessed wrong, or missed a cue or need a new skill. Perhaps we have to find a way to get the benefit of the doubt or simply need more practice and experience.
But, with apologies to Gödel, maybe there is no solution. Maybe the thing we thought was a problem wasn’t a problem to be solved (because problems have solutions) maybe it was simply a situation or even a dead end. Given who you are, what you know and what you’re dealing with, there actually wasn’t the possibility for success, even if it seemed there was.
Or perhaps there was luck involved, and this time, the luck wasn’t on our side (perhaps 20% of the applicants who are qualified get in to famous colleges, which means that kids who do their best still have just a 1 in 5 chance of admission).
If there was no acceptable solution, or there was more bad luck than we hoped, then there’s no room for shame or blame or recriminations. All we can do is honor the situation and work to find the next thing, another opportunity to contribute or grow. Spending cycles on blame (of ourselves or others) is time we can ill afford to waste.","May 2, 2021","possibility, learning, resilience"
Compared to what?,"Organized sports, particularly for school-age kids, present a real challenge. The results are easily measured and are on just one axis. Points scored. Winning vs. losing.
If we teach a child to identify with the outcomes in this way, we might create arrogance. If you win, after all, you must be better than the others.
This is where the big man on campus comes from, the push for dominance and the brittle self-worth that can lead to bullying.
And of course, it’s not just sports, and it’s not just high school.
But in any scarcity-driven competition, sooner or later, you’re not going to win. You’re not going be state champ, national champ, world champ… Sooner or later, if you’re honest, you’ll need to acknowledge that winning isn’t going to happen.
And then what happens?
Economic utility almost always occurs when we’re good at things thataren’teasy to measure. And when the things we’re good at are additive, infinite and generous it can be something we embrace for the long haul. Because in those areas, it’s possible to be useful and skilled and make a contribution, every single time.
If you have a chance to play a game that’s based on scarcity and winner-take-all, perhaps it pays to play a different game instead.","May 1, 2021","sports, competition, self-worth"
The market is a listening device,"It’s the most resilient, most granular technique available for us to figure out what people want.
When individuals have the freedom to choose, they often do.
At the same time that markets enable choice, large-scale industrial capitalism works overtime to remove it. The main job of most big company CEOs is to figure out how to lock in customers, because customers without choices stick around longer and pay more.
Some organizations exist to satisfy market demand.
Some work hard to create market demand.
And some are focused on capturing demand and then eliminating the market itself.
The internet has created changes in both directions. We have dramatically more choice when it comes to ways to spend/waste our time, but we also have to deal with the natural monopolies created by the network effect and the hidden levers that drive toward lock in.
If we’re not alert, many of the choice-driven markets we depend on will disappear.","June 30, 2021","market dynamics, consumer choice, industrial capitalism"
Luck is not a strategy,"Advice from people who have gotten lucky is a tricky thing.
Perhaps they did x, y and z, and then got lucky. As story telling creatures, it’s natural to assume that x, y or z had something to do with it. Which can lead to bad advice.
Consider the guy who smoked like a chimney, drank like a fish and lived to be 100. It’s not clear that his habits helped him get lucky.
Luck might not be a strategy, but setting yourself up to be lucky might be.
Luck is a tactic. An unpredictable one, sure, but if it works, it works. A useful strategy might be: I’m going to establish a pattern of resilience and apply information and testing to discover what works. And one of the tactics to support that strategy could be showing up in places where luck can help me out. If I can persist long enough, I’ll get lucky.
But that’s very different than the false correlation of past behavior with lucky outcomes.","June 29, 2021","Luck, Strategy, Resilience"
What’s new?,"That’s a fun question, but not nearly as useful as, “what’s effective?”
Pick up a fifteen-year-old copy ofWired, or a business book from 1969 and see what’s still around.
The technology keeps changing, but connection and trust are what still work. Ideas that spread, win. Ideas that stick are worth even more. You can race to be first on a new platform, but it’s far better to be the voice that we would miss if you weren’t there.","June 28, 2021","Effective communication, Connection, Ideas"
Anecdotes are not science,"Phrenology was discredited a long time ago. People who should have known better were sure that by studying the bumps on someone’s head, a trained expert could divine insights about their personality. It ended up being used to advance racist and class-based agendas, and was completely debunked. It faded away for decades. And it’s back.
New technology creates the appearance (and sometimes the actual fact) of new insights, new resolution, new certainty.
We might not know what an oscillation overthruster is, or why single photon imaging is better, but it sounds well studied and precise. A chart from Excel seems a lot more certain than one that’s hand drawn.
In our search for anecdotes, particularly about health, behavior or the economy, this apparent increase in accuracy opens the door for more hope, even if it’s not based on widespread results.
The charts used to describe the behavior of stocks and tokens keep getting more complex and refined, but they’re still unable to accurately predict what will happen next week.
The fancy readouts of horoscopes or biorhythms glow with many insignificant digits, but they still tell us nothing about someone’s future, any more than palm reading does.
And an x-ray can tell us with great certainty if your appendix has burst, but a SPECT scan is useless in determining someone’s personality without the aid of an in-person consultation, which is all we’ve ever needed. In fact, that’s precisely how phrenology used to work: meet with someone first, then find validation in the mysterious reading of their bumps.
The standard worth checking for is easy: From the chart or the bumps or the scan alone, without meeting the patient, tell me what you see and what’s going to happen next.
They put Einstein’s brain in a jar, but learned nothing from it.
The folks who ate green coffee beans or swallowed colloidal silver have plenty of anecdotes to support their placebos. And when they move on from pyramids to magnets, the anecdotes will follow them. But anecdotes aren’t science. Like coincidences, they’re by-products of our story-seeking minds, connections we make as we search for solace in a confusing world. And sometimes marketers use the anecdotes to make a sale and hurt the customer.
Very few interventions that involve humans are simple. We need more than a double-blind study, because humans aren’t double-blind. We know what’s on offer, and the story we tell ourselves changes how we behave.
Science is oftennotthe right answer to every question–it often fails to deliver what we need. But hustles pretending to be science are almost always a bad idea.
In fact, stories are too important and worthwhile to need a babble of pseudoscience that some would like put on them.
Placebosare powerful, and if they’re cheap and benign, I’m all for them. My day is filled with placebos of all kinds, because they work. The problems happen when they stop being benign, when they keep us from appropriate treatment and when they’re used against us…
Somehow, we’ve persuaded ourselves that we need to pretend that our anecdotal interventions are actual scientific breakthroughs instead of embracing the fact that we’re humans, and that stories work on us. By wearing the mantle of science, hypesters are not only able to charge more, but they also degrade the reputation of the very methods they purport to use–when we see firsthand that pretend science doesn’t work, we’re tempted to imagine that the same is true for interventions that are actually studied and tested.
We wouldn’t fly on a plane or cross a bridge that was built with the same doublespeak that many folk medicines and soothsayers use. They have their place, they make us who we are, but anecdotes aren’t science.","June 27, 2021","Anecdotes, Pseudoscience, Placebo"

When the objections change,"An objection is a useful way to understand what someone wants or needs. “I might buy that, but I need one that comes in red,” helps you learn that the color choice matters to this person.
Sometimes, it’s possible that an objection can be overcome. “I just found a red one in the warehouse,” certainly deals with the color issue.
If that happens, if new information overcomes a previous objection, it’s often followed by anewobjection. “The safety issue you said you were worried about is addressed in this peer-reviewed study…”  And then there’s another objection, and another…
What’s actually happening is the person is saying, “I’m afraid.”
It might be, “I’m afraid to tell you that I’m not interested.” But it’s more likely that it’s, “I’m afraid of the unknown, I’m afraid about what my friends will think, I’m afraid about money…”
And there are two reasons that people won’t tell you that they’re afraid. First, because our culture has taught us that fear is something to be ashamed of. But far more than that, because we’re concerned that if we share our fear, you’ll push us to go forward, and we’re afraid to do that.
When dealing with someone who’s afraid, when they’re objecting to something that’s important, it’s tempting to imagine that more evidence will make a difference–that it’s the objections that matter. But more studies of efficacy or public health or performance aren’t going to address the real objection.
Money (“it’s too expensive”) is a common objection, but it’s often not the real reason. Price is simply a useful way to end the conversation.
“I’m afraid” is something we don’t want to say, so we search for an objection instead.
And what leads to forward motion? Either a shift in the culture, in peer approval, which lowers fear. Or sometimes, the fear of doing nothing exceeds the fear of moving forward.","June 25, 2021","objections, fear, communication"
How much does a mistake cost?,"Errors are preventable.
But preventing errors requires an investment. Before committing to an error-free production environment, it’s worth calculating the cost.
A typo on this blog is relatively inexpensive. (Thanks to loyal reader Seth Barnes for graciously emailing me when one slips through).
On the other hand, a mistake in calculating the route of a high-speed rail line might cost a billion dollars… And we probably don’t want any errors on the pacemaker assembly line.
If you’ve decided that errors are too expensive for your project, then build a system that doesn’t depend on heroics to avoid errors. Sure, that costs more than just trying harder, but if trying harder was going to reduce errors, it would have worked already.
The pilot who painstakingly works through the pre-flight checklist might not be a swashbuckling Maverick type, but they are much less likely to be the victim of a careless error. The reason that planes don’t crash is because there are countless layers of redundancy and systems to be sure that they don’t.
Spend the time and spend the money and the errors can be avoided. Or accept that errors are part of wayfinding, and realize that your problem is caused by a systemic situation, not a lack of effort.","June 24, 2021","cost of errors, prevention systems, investment in accuracy"
The wayfinding premium,"The second time you rewire a system after finding a hum, it might take two minutes. The first time, the time you figured out what the problem was, it might have taken two hours.
Typing a book takes a few days at most. Figuring out what to type might take years.
We are either adding value by using our time to do something that’s been done before… or we’re contributing by finding out a way to do something new or create a better path forward.
If you’re simply ‘typing’, the work might still be important, but you’re not fulfilling your potential. You won’t earn as much in the way of respect, compensation or satisfaction, either.
On the other hand, if you’ve signed up for wayfinding, forgive yourself if it takes a little (or a lot) longer. Because if we knew the right answer, we would have found it already. That’s the hard part.
It’s possible that you can earn a wayfinding premium when you’re merely repeating something you discovered a while ago, but that’s hard to maintain. And it’s possible that you could find someone to solve your interesting problem fast and cheap, but that’s unlikely.
Being really clear about what we’re buying (and selling) opens the door to getting serious about whether or not you’re here to solve an interesting problem.","June 23, 2021","wayfinding, value, problem-solving"
Self-conception,"The mirror might not lie, but no one looks at you in the mirror more than you do.
Your business or project or life story is intimately known to you. You have lived it. But the outside world will never see all of it,cannever see all of it.
And so we bump into the disconnect. The disconnect between the thing we know so well and what others have decided based on their own agenda, background and limited experience with us and our work.
When they don’t align, we can focus on the quality and consistency of our story, and be sure that our actions are integral with the conception we’re working so hard to share.
Consistency is what people pay attention to, and when it’s not there, they make up a story about why. Because they can’t truly know.","June 22, 2021","self-conception, disconnect, consistency"
A new decision based on new information,"People don’t say yes or change their minds because you persist.
That’s because we don’t like to admit we were wrong.
If we’re going to go forward, it’s because something has changed. It might be that our situation is different, that the story we tell ourselves is different, that the times have changed or that your offering has. It might be that we trust you more.

Busy (and reliable),"The thing that made you busy might have been the reputation you earned for being reliable.
Ironically, that very busy-ness might destroy your reputation. That’s one reason that so many service providers stumble once they begin to gain traction.
There are two things you can do before the crisis hits:
First, say “no.” A lot. The gigs you would have taken when you were struggling might not be the gigs you should take now. Your reputation for reliability earns you more trust, and that trust gets you invited to work with better clients and on better projects. The cost (benefit) of that is that you’ll need to turn down opportunities that you would have been willing to take on just a little while ago.
Second, tell the truth. It’s hard at first, particularly since our self-conception might have been built around independence and invulnerability. But being reliable doesn’t mean being perfect. It means being clear.
Two mottos that might help:
“You’ll pay a lot, but you’ll get more than you paid for.”

In control,"Is this a want or a need?
Do you know anyone who has managed to gain control over things outside of their grasp? Honking at traffic serves no purpose other than to express a need to control the uncontrollable.

Non-machinable surcharge,"I got a marketing letter from a colleague yesterday. Not a sales pitch, just an update on what they were up to.
I was delighted to discover that this mass mailing had a hand-lettered address on it, with little bits of water color for fun. It was slightly irregularly shaped, requiring an extra stamp because it wasn’t machinable. Inside, in addition to a personal (and personalized) note, there was a gift card for an ice cream cone. But the coolest part was that the card wasn’t from a national chain, it was from the local place down the street.
It obviously cost more in time to create than it was going to take me to read. It obviously didn’t go to a lot of people.
And that imbalance is now rare.
People eager to hustle are busy spamming lists of millions of people with an email that takes two minutes to write and poorly mail merge, giving the hustler a 2,000 to 1 advantage in time spent vs. time consumed. It’s a form of leverage that feels like theft to the recipient, because our time, the irreplaceable thing we all are given, was taken.
Of course, I don’t need an ice cream cone, and a small gift card isn’t a bribe. What it represents is care and respect. The opposite of hustle. It was done withsprezzatura, not with a transaction in mind.
None of it works unless you’ve already earned permission. It doesn’t work if it’s part of a clever hustle. It doesn’t work if it’s seen as spam or creates uncomfortable tension or a need for reciprocity. It simply works because it required a surcharge. Instead of using an asset, you can choose to build one.
[And yes, this is exactly the opposite of the way my bank answers the phone, the way most customer service is grudgingly offered, the way many publicists do their job, the way that organizations make foolish choices about attention and trust…] The question shouldn’t be, “does it scale?” Instead, it might be, “is it worth it?”
Interactions with the people who are enrolled and giving you the benefit of the doubt are a form ofavocado time. They shouldn’t be optimized for efficiency or even leverage. Instead, it’s a chance to make a difference.

Lucky breaks,"Almost every project comes in a little bit late and a little bit over budget.
When things break, the breaks are rarely lucky ones.
Part of the reason is that in proposing the project we made our best guess and predicted the predictable. If we didn’t, the project would probably never get approved.
Optimists bring an expectation of possibility and goodwill. But they’re also aware of the math of coordination. Hiccups multiply.

So we show up for the work, do the reading, engage with the problem. The challenge is to find a point of view if we don’t have one yet.

What is the scary part?Which outcomes or interactions are you trying to avoid thinking about or interacting with? Why?

False equivalencies,"It’s a pointless form of argument.
“This scientist made a careless error in their paper, therefore we need to excuse a con artist who falsified an entire career.”
Or, “that restaurant served fish that got someone sick, therefore, there’s no reason for there to be a health inspection at my restaurant or any other one for that matter.”
Or, “there was a typo in this book from a major publisher, so I’m not going to bother with an editor at all.”
The open-minded respond by trying to defend the original error or the intent behind it. But that simply amplifies the false equivalency argument and leads to a no-standards race to the bottom.

The airline mile hoax,"First: If you’re a frequent flyer on American and haven’t flown in over a year, it’s possible your miles are going to expire very soon. You can fix this by “donating” 2,500 mileshere.
In the US, private lotteries are against the law. A lottery is a random drawing for a prize of value that you have to pay to participate in.
That’s different from a game of skill, in which the best performance wins.
Or a sweepstakes, which doesn’t cost anything to enter (which is why the rules so often say ‘no purchase necessary.’)
The question is: Is it a random/lucky thing to be able to trade in your miles for the prize you were promised? I think it’s pretty clear that as the points economy has gotten into the billions, the answer is yes. There aren’t as many ‘free’ seats per miles as there used to be. The airlines benefit when they offer fewer and fewer seats as a percentage of available points floating around, because then people are pushed to either ignore their miles or settle for something less than they expected.
Some people play with points as a hobby. For the rest of us, they’re worth way less than they appear. But mostly I wanted to remind you not to let yours expire. Thanks for staying safe by staying home.

Disenchantment,"It originally means, “no longer believing in magic.”
Humans like magic. It gives us solace and energy and hope.

But we still desire magic.

“No problem” is a problem,"The right response to feedback is, “thank you.” Or perhaps, “that’s a great point.” Even if it’s not your job to change the system, or not your fault that things didn’t work as expected, both of these responses are valid and useful.
Feedback is a gift. It lets you know precisely what the other person wants or needs. After you receive the gift, it’s up to you to accept it or not. But shutting down feedback with an argument or by appearing ungrateful makes it less likely you’ll be offered it again. And if you’re getting feedback from a customer or a prospect, shutting it down makes it likely that they’ll walk away and take their attention and their trust somewhere else.
When you say, “no problem,” you’re letting yourself off the hook, refusing to acknowledge what was said and closing the door for a useful interaction. Because thereisa problem. Exploring what the problem is is far better than denying it.","June 11, 2021","feedback, gratitude, communication"

Two ways to challenge the status quo,"Slowly, or all at once.
Culture shifts slowly. “People like us do things like this.” Seismic events may make newspaper headlines, but they don’t rapidly change the way human beings in community behave.
Instead, the status quo erodes, redefining itself as it goes. If you’re the kind of person who believes in what’s all around us (which is most of us), then you won’t change your beliefs until the people around you change as well.
That’s why the smallest viable audience is so important. Focusing on a specific group of people, understanding their beliefs, engaging with empathy, creating new social norms and then, peer-to-peer, spreading the new normal.
Science, on the other hand, can shift more rapidly.A new paper detailing groundbreaking research on Parkinson’s disease, for example, can persuade 100 of the right doctors and funders of a paradigm shift. If they’re participating in the scientific method, they’ll do their research and change their assumptions.
And then, as always, it goes back to the slow move toward culture shift. It took twenty years for the medical community to embrace the fact that ulcers were caused by bacteria, not pastrami sandwiches. The bacteria didn’t care if the community believed in them, but the patients were glad the doctors made a new decision based on new information.
The culture is changing far more rapidly than it ever has before. And yet, it still changes slowly enough for us to grow impatient when important ideas and practices around health, justice and community are ignored.
And yet it changes. Persistent and consistent effort with focus is our only way forward.","June 9, 2021","Status quo, culture shift, science"
Lessons learned the hard way,"It will be a long time before I spell “handkerchief” incorrectly. That’s because in third grade, I lost the entry round of the spelling bee to my friend Elisa because I got it wrong. Who knew that there was a “d”?
And now I know where I keep the thermos in my house. I spent twenty minutes looking for it the other day, and failed. A few days later, I came across it. Because of the previous challenge of missing it, my brain was on high alert when it finally appeared.
That’s how we learn most of the foundational things that we know, remember and care about–not through exposure, but through effort and failure.

Production values,"The gulf between network news of 1968 and cable news of today is dramatic, far more than the shift in, say, a typical sitcom. The Dick Van Dyke show is quaint, but it has a lot in common with a sitcom of today. The news, on the other hand, is completely different.
A generation ago, delivering the news was a civic duty. Now it’s a profit center.
The quick edits, the crawling text, the noise–it all exists to remind us of a thrilling movie, not of real life.
And the clickbaiting reality of online news multiplies that.
But real life isn’t like that. An actual house-fire or street demonstration is boring compared to what we’re shown in the media.
Does the increase in drama, tension and fear that these production values create produce anything of value?
Would it be possible to be an informed citizen without it?

The benefit of the doubt,"It’s priceless.
When we’re used to it, when it comes along as a result of nothing we did to earn it, we take it for granted. But when you don’t have it, it makes everything more difficult.
The benefit of the doubt is what happens when instead of being skeptical, we’re inclined to believe. It’s when instead of defaulting to ignoring a stranger, we seek to engage with them. It’s the convenient choice, not the exception.
In different settings, we grant the benefit of the doubt to the big man on campus, the homecoming queen, the tall person, the celebrity, the person who apparently has amassed a lot of money, the one who fits our cultural mores, the male, the white person, the conventionally pretty one, the conventionally abled one, the one who is popular. But it also might be the class cut-up, the insurgent or the renegade.
Status roles are the silent measure of our days, and we often default to reinforcing them based on an unseen and uncommented on status quo.
Every time we fail to give the benefit of the doubt to someone who can create value, we not only hurt them, but we hurt ourselves as well.","June 5, 2021","benefit of the doubt, skepticism, social dynamics"
The reciprocity hustle,"People are culturally wired to want to reciprocate. That’s one of the things that make a community function–someone does something nice for you and you’re inclined to want to find a way to do something nice in return.
Along the way, that instinct has been turned into a selfish way to get what you want.
Find someone you need (or will need) something from, figure out a way to do them a ‘favor’ and then use the interaction to create the conditions where the other person feels obligated to help you in return.
First, no one likes to be hustled.
Second, your hustle is more transparent than you realize.
Third, people value things differently. The thing you thought was a big lift didn’t mean that much to the person you did it for, or the thing you’re hoping they’ll do in return is far more difficult than it appears to be from your perspective.
The alternative is to go through your day oblivious to the idea that reciprocity might be a thing that other people feel compelled to act on. Simply show up with good intent to do work that you’re proud of.
If we do this with consistency and care, sooner or later, it comes back around. Not because we hustled, but precisely because we didn’t.","June 4, 2021","reciprocity, authenticity, community"
Monarchists,"For as long as there’s been recorded history, kings and queens have ruled and been celebrated by their subjects. Not everywhere, not all the time, but widely.
Not simply the royalty of nations, but of organizations as well.
It’s worth noting that in addition to monarchs, there are monarchists, citizens and employees and followers who prefer the certainty that comes from someone else.
Royalty offers something to some of those who are ruled. If it didn’t, it wouldn’t exist.
As Sahlins and Graeber outline in their extraordinary (and dense) book onKings, there’s often a pattern in the nature of monarchs. Royalty doesn’t have to play by the same cultural rules, and often ‘comes from away.’ Having someone from a different place and background allows the population to let themselves off the hook when it comes to creating the future.
If your participation in leadership is not required, then you’re free to simply be a spectator.
When we industrialized the world over the last century, we defaulted to this structure. Many Western industrial organizations began as founder-celebrated and founder-driven. CEOs could, apparently, do no wrong. Until the world their business operated in changed.
In large corporations, the autocratic, well-paid chieftain has the trappings of a monarch. A private air force, minions and the automatic benefit of the doubt. Working in this setting requires obedience and effort from employees more than agency or independence.
A well-functioning constitutional monarchy is surprisingly effective. That’s not the problem. The problem is what happens when it stops to function well. The problem can happen when royalty becomes selfish, shortsighted or impatient. Or the problem could be a pattern of employees or members or citizens failing to participate. Resilience disappears and the system becomes brittle.
When the world changes, and it does, faster than ever, it’s community and connection that moves us forward.
Modern organizations are discovering that all of us know more than any of us, and that engaged individuals ready to not only speak up but to eagerly take responsibility for the work they do is an effective, resilient and equitable way to show up in the world.","June 3, 2021","Monarchists, Leadership, Organizational Structure"

Meeting nullification,"Here are two policies it might be fun to try for a week:
Meeting abstention:Anyone invited to an internal meeting has the power to opt-out. “Send me the summary, please.” If someone abstains, they give up their ability to have a say in the meeting, but most meetings these days don’t actually give people a platform to have a say. And then that person can leave the Zoom room and get back to whatever it is they were doing that was actually productive.
Meeting nullification:If anyone in an internal meeting announces that the meeting is a pointless waste of time, it’s over. The meeting organizer is obligated to send everyone the memo that they probably should have sent in the first place.
If you discover that you’re calling meetings where people abstain, or worse, call for nullification, perhaps you should be more careful about which meetings you call and who you invite.
Does your organization have the guts to try this out? Do you, as an attendee, care enough to abstain?
The fact that even discussing this idea is stressful helps us understand status roles andpower.",,"Meeting abstention, Meeting nullification, Organizational effectiveness"

Fresh herbs,"Chain restaurants rarely use fresh herbs. They’re uneven, unreliable and expensive, and most diners have been conditioned to want food that’s more processed and bland.
The same is true for most of what we buy and sell. It’s becoming ever more predictable, pre-processed and cost-reduced.
The pressure tends to go in one direction–turn your work into a commodity, smooth over the edges and fit in all the way. That seems hard to argue with, particularly if you want to be popular and profitable.
But the restaurant that makes the best sabich in all of New York City takes a different approach. AtNana, in an obscure shopping mall on the outskirts of an outer borough, they’re serving memorable food that doesn’t match the prevailing industrial model. You can’t get something similar from your grocer’s freezer. It’s distinctive and probably a lot more difficult to produce on a regular basis.
The same could be true for what you choose to do. It might not get you a Fortune 500 company as a client, and probably won’t make you #1 on whatever bestseller list tracks the one that’s for everyone, but it might be exactly the work that you’re proud to do.

“Make the sign bigger!”,"Make the announcement louder. Make the logo bigger. Yell. Call more people on the phone to sell them an extended warranty. Send more emails. Hustle harder.
None of it works.
The problem with the fountain isn’t that they didn’t make a big enough sign. The problem is that the fountain itself is poorly designed. It’s an attractive nuisance, a dangerous thing to put in the middle of a boring courtyard. The sides invite sitting and standing, and the height beckons people to walk in and around it. And the consistent cues of its design aren’t going to be undone by an ugly, intrusive sign, even one in red with ALL CAPS.
And louder and more persistent PA announcements aren’t going to help if the situation people are in has lulled them into not listening.
And a bigger logo isn’t going to get someone to care about your company if the product and your story don’t resonate with them.

Narrative and feelings,"Which comes first? The feelings, the facts, or the story we tell ourselves that leads to the feelings?
It’s surprising that I ended up at the college I went to.
Back in 1978, there were two ways to visit campus if you were taking a subway from the airport. One route went through Harvard Square, with its magical campus, and then via bus down youth-friendly Mass. Ave., past Steve’s famous ice cream parlor and on to the small school. The other route, the route the admissions office suggested when I called them, went through gritty Lechmere, then by bus past wood-frame houses built in the 1950s, then some more grittiness and then on to the back of the campus.
It would have been easy to use the feelings that the second route created in me, a solo traveler barely 17 years old, to invent a narrative about what was missing from this choice of school.
We like to think we make complicated decisions based on rational analysis, but most of the time, we actually make an emotional decision and then invent a rational analysis to justify it.
That’s why so many kids pick a school based on how it felt to go to a football game there in October. Or why it matters if it’s raining on the day you visit. Feelings first, then they create a story. Facts come in third.
If our goal is to help people make better choices, it helps to first create better feelings.","July 27, 2021","narrative, feelings, decision-making"
Bad arithmetic classes persuade people to not like math,"Arithmetic is a chore. It’s a ceaseless list of things to be memorized, with few understood. It is easily replaced by an app on a phone.

“Let the market fix it”,"After all, the marketplace is scalable, independent, self-funding, convenient and persistent.
Except there are problems that the market hasn’t solved, and probably can’t. A century into this worldwide experiment, the market hasn’t solved mass education, it’s made obesity and health problems worse, and it has dumped an enormous amount of long-term toxic waste into the world where we all live.
Patient capital can work wonders, but networked economies are becoming ever more impatient in their race for basis points and shortcuts.
When we hand a chronic problem over to the market, it might be because we can’t bear to look at it or take responsibility for the hard work and sacrifice it will take to solve it.
If the market can solve a problem, it’s a bargain. Markets are effective listening devices and resilient and often self-coordinating. But expecting the market to solve every problem isn’t useful.
Sometimes, the specific tools of the open market aren’t aligned with the problem at hand. Externalities, patience and incentives are all worth considering before we decide the problem will solve itself.","July 25, 2021","market limitations, externalities, patient capital"

“I don’t want to play”,"Tactical approaches can undermine useful strategies.
And knowing your goals and the reason for the game are the best way to avoid the problem.
Tactical thinking forces us to think in innings. It says, “here’s a situation, what’s your best reaction/response?”
The strategic approach has a different question, “Does playing this particular tactical game get me closer to the reason I’m here in the first place?”
Strategies don’t change. They’re not a secret. It doesn’t matter if your peers or opponents know your strategy.
Tactics, on the other hand, change often, and are usually best kept quiet.
So why do we get so hung up on tactics?
It begins with: Strategies can be frightening. If we say what we want and how we hope to achieve it, two things could happen: we could fail, and that would disappoint us, or we could succeed, and that would frighten us.
It’s easier to simply react by engaging in another tactical round that the world has presented to us. You can spend your days doing nothing but playing with tactics, and never realize you didn’t even have a strategy.
What do you want? What change do you seek to make, how do you want to spend your days? How will get you there?
Figuring out which games you aren’t going to play is a fine step on the road to figuring out your strategy.

"Yadda, yadda, yadda","If you are talking with someone about important things, from the heart, with honesty, it’s entirely possible that what you’re saying contradicts what they expect.
It might be because of the indoctrination of a lifetime of growing up in a particular culture.
It might be because of personal experiences they’ve had with others that didn’t work out very well.
And it might be because what you’re saying contradicts what they’re seeing.
Whichever it is, they nod their head, politely listening, but don’t change their expectations at all. Because they’ve been taught through experience not to believe that things are going to be different.

We have a volunteer fire department in town, but we don’t often have a volunteer corps dedicated to long-term culture change. Even typing that out seems odd.
But the chronic problems define our future, and the persistent changes over time brought us to where we are. Evolution of species is a chronic process. And most of us die from chronic illnesses.

99.99% of what’s produced and sold is a copy or variation of something that was already made and sold. That’s the power of industry to shape our world–it’s very good at producing more of what’s finding a market.
And so we paved more roads, built more cars and pumped more oil. And we made more telemarketing calls, sent more spam and bought more ads. And we built more houses, produced more bandages and developed ever more convenient ways to shop.

A return to cottage work,"Businesses care about productivity. At the core of their ability to create a profit is the simple formula of work produced per dollar spent.
Frederick Taylorused a stopwatch to revolutionize the production of cars and just about everything else. By measuring the output of each person on the line, he was able to dramatically increase how much a company like Ford could produce for every hour of labor it used.
Working in a system like this can be exhausting. While it brings the comfort of knowing precisely what’s expected in any given moment, it’s also an endless tug of war between humanity and profit.
Many in the idea economy haven’t recognized the rare situation that they might be in. Better pay, better working conditionsanda job that’s hard to measure with a stopwatch. So you’ve got the chef for the Grateful Dead cooking you lunch and a purple couch in the lobby, along with a long series of perks and benefits. I had one friend who worked at a law firm for two years before they realized that he kept switching departments every few months so he could avoid being asked to bill too many hours.
But management has never stopped looking for a way to measure output. Sooner or later, they do, or the company disappears. It can vary from the insulation of paying for your time (but keeping track of impact created) all the way to paying by the keystroke, the click or the sale.
When bosses had trouble measuring output, they bought our time, and then layered ‘process’ and bureaucracy on everything as a stand-in for actual productivity. But now, measurement is everywhere, freelancers and contractors are easier to find, and work is being atomized. Being good at process is a weak stand-in for being good at work.
The shift to self-directed days, working from home, focusing on projects and not simply selling our time means that this push back to cottage industry management is going to be accelerated. Before Manchester factories were up to speed, this was normal–you did your work on your kitchen table and got paid by the piece.
The alternative is to double down on work that’s truly hard to measure, to sign up for emotional labor and experimentation and group leadership and working on the frontier. These jobs are harder to get, harder to keep and are fraught precisely because they’re less measurable. These are the jobs that create quantum leaps in value, but are hard to spec and manage.
Companies aren’t going to trust you because you asked them to. They’ll do it when they believe that you are one of the few people who can lean outside of the comfort zone and bring back something extraordinary.
It’s pretty clear to me that we’re unlikely to see much in the way of steady jobs where someone tells you what to do all day, allows you to allocate your own time and effort, but doesn’t measure your output. Because one thing that we all keep learning is that if something can be measured, it probably will be.","July 14, 2021","productivity, measurement, cottage industry"
A coaching paradox,"At the top tier of just about any sort of endeavor, you’ll find that the performers have coaches.
Pianists, orators and athletes all have coaches. In fact, it would be weird if we heard of someone on stage or on the field who didn’t have one.
And yet, in the world of business, they’re seen as the exception.
Part of the reason is that work feels like an extension of something we’ve been doing our whole lives. Figure skating isn’t like school, but showing up at work seems to be. “I’ve got this,” is a badge of honor.
And part of the reason is that a few coaches have made claims that stretch belief, and we’re not actually sure what they do. It doesn’t help that there’s no easy way to identify what sort of coach we need or what we’re going to get…
It turns out that the people with the potential to benefit the most from a coach are often the most hesitant precisely because of what coaching involves.
Talking about our challenges. Setting goals. Acknowledging that we can get better. Eagerly seeking responsibility…
And yet we avert our eyes and hesitate. It might be because having a coach might be interpreted as a sign of weakness. And what if we acknowledge our challenges but fail to overcome them? It could be that we don’t want to cause change to happen, or that we’re worried that we will.
One company I admire believes in coaches so much that they’ve put several on staff, ensuring that their leadership all benefit from one. But mostly, it’s something we have to pay for ourselves.
And so, paying for a coach, for something that’s hard to measure, which might be socially awkward, to get better at something that feels normal—combine that with a hesitancy to ask for help—it’s a wonder anyone has a coach.
The paradox is that the very things that hold us back are the reasons we need a coach in the first place.

The current is our persistent systems of class and race and gender, and the powerful industrial economy. It can be overcome, but it takes focused effort.

Abracadabra,"The word is thousands of years old, and it probably comes from theAramaic: “I will create it as I speak.”
We’re much more likely to believe what we say than the other way around.

Old-school snobs,"Two centuries ago, shoemakers in England were called snobs. (It sort of rhymes with cobbler).
Good ones combined care with quality. They put in the effort to make a shoe that exceeded expectations, and leaned into the possibility of their craft. The others were simply hacks, trying to get by with little effort.
In an ironic and cruel twist, the term “snob” was taken from these committed craftspeople and used to describe someone who looked down on others, particularly those with fewer resources. A hard-working cobbler was viewed with disdain, because they had no silver spoon. It was also used to describe someone who gave those with more money or caste a persistent benefit of the doubt that they might not deserve.
And for a century the term has been pushed beyond cultural economics to describe someone who is a defender of scarcity and the status quo. A wine snob, for example, insisted on an expensive vintage, preferably from certain parts of Europe.
The circle comes around, as it often does. The best kind of snob is a throwback to that original cobbler and their customers, someone who can see past appearances or the traditional approaches and instead looks for care and quality. Which can happen regardless of where someone comes from. It’s not enough to be a cobbler. You need to be one who cares.
Effort and good judgment lead to good taste and cultural leadership.
We shouldn’t settle.","July 8, 2021","snob, craftsmanship, quality"
What did you learn on vacation?,"It always seemed like a silly question–school is for doing what you’re told, summer vacation was for discovering all the things that were worth caring about.
As adults though, regardless of our hemisphere, we’re always on vacation from school. No tests or diplomas, simply a huge array of choices.
And in a world that keeps changing, regardless of how much we might want it to slow down, learning is the attribute that is often overlooked.

The focus on the last thing,"The play before time ran out. The last speech of the campaign. The typo on your resume or the spot on your tie. The final decision before the company declared bankruptcy.
We focus on the thing that happened just before the end. And that’s almost always an unimportant moment.
Things went wrong (or things went right) because of a long series of decisions and implementations. A misguided strategy, a bad hire, a brilliant insight about network effects–these are the acts with leverage, not the obvious thing that all the pundits would like to talk about.
When you get to the thing before the last thing, don’t sweat it. It’s almost certainly too late to make the outcome change. On the other hand, when you’re quietly discussing the thing before that before that before that before that, it might pay to bring more attention to it than the circumstances seem to demand. Becausethat’sthe key moment.",,"focus, decisions, key moments"
Customer development,"Organizations grow when they develop a base of customers.
Companies find profits, non-profits serve their cause, political ideas become movements for just one reason: they develop a group of people who are changed by what they do. For ease, let’s call them ‘customers.’
Once you see that, it becomes pretty clear that this is the most difficult and important thing that the organization does, and in fact is the only one you can’t outsource or work your way around.
It’s possible but unlikely that the first product or service you develop will be exactly what potential customers were already hoping for. That’s why failure is the fuel that moves new projects forward.Failure is a way of discovering one more thing that customers didn’t want, and perhaps, learning a bit about what they might want. By iterating without tears or fears, organizations are able to discover things about their future customers.
Sometimes (actually, almost every time) the innovation an organization brings to the market isn’t instantly and universally adopted. While there are people who get satisfaction and status and results by going first (early adopters), most customers would prefer to wait. These customers see little upside in investing the time to be a pioneer or in taking the risk to go first.
[And to be clear, that’s true for non-profit donors, voters and any other sort of ‘customer’].
And so you see the paradox: on one hand, organizations need to be agile and eager to pivot as they engage with a market that’s invisible or skeptical, but on the other hand, ideas don’t spread through a marketplace instantly.
That’s one reason why it’s so important to identify your smallest viable audience. The smallest group of customers that will enable you to thrive. By seeing them, obsessing about them and serving them, you can refine your product at the very same time that you establish the conditions for growth.
At this stage, growth can come from one of two places:
It could be that your core audience begins to tell the others. That you’ve built the network effect into your offering, so that it works even better when people tell their friends and colleagues. This is Tom’s shoes or Starbucks coffee. This is Twitter and the ice bucket challenge as well. When you create a purple cow, the remarkable nature of your product or service is in fact part of the reason people buy it, and the reason they talk about it. Not because it helps you, but because it helps them.
Or, just as powerful, it could be that your success at serving this small but viable audience gives you the team, the cash flow and most of all, the social proof to begin to find a different set of customers. Customers that might want a different set of benefits, a different story, a different way to change.
Often, this shift to a different customer set is difficult, because now you might feel stretched, you might even have to leave behind the people who originally embraced you and your offering. Patagonia doesn’t spend a lot of time selling removable pitons to hard-core rock climbers anymore. As they shifted to become the organization they are now, they probably got a lot of push back from people who said, “no one buys from them anymore, it’s too popular.”
Both approaches share two underlying principles:
You’re telling a story.
You’re making a change.
Being clear about ‘who’s it for?’ and ‘what’s it for?’ is the actual hard work of developing customers. And if you’re not gaining traction, deciding to hype harder is not the right choice. Traction doesn’t come from more social posting or working your network and asking for favors. Traction comes from accompanying the customers you’ve chosen on a journey that they’re eager to go on.
And the hard work of customer development is finding a reason for your customers to bring in new customers, or discovering a path where you can help non-customers discover what you offer and eagerly engage with it.

Rigor and Rigid,"They sound the same but work in opposite directions. They both began as Latin terms for stiff and unyielding, but now, they’ve diverged.
A rigid approach is easy to describe, but it’s brittle. Being rigid takes little imagination and a fair amount of fear.
On the other hand, approaching our craft with rigor means that we’re able to eagerly shift in the face of reality. We have rules for ourselves, but one of the rules is to adapt.

Folk typography,"Why is type getting so bad?
Well, actually, the people who are noticing it, the ones who care about kerning or keming or serifs or the rest… we’re not the reason that it’s getting bad.
It’s all the people who don’t notice it.
For thousands of years, type was something you did with your hands. If you were a writer, you were also the person who was putting the words onto the paper.
It was only in the last few centuries that setting type was a craft, reserved for people with a printing press, or a set of Letraset rub-down letters or even a top-of-the-line Mac with the right software.
And so, into this specialty, principles developed. There was actually a difference between professional and amateur typesetting. There was style and craft and insight that was worth paying for. There were magazines and conferences about what looked good and right and professional and cutting edge.
Of course, social media changed that. Memes and the rest, built on a flimsy foundation of Comic Sans and Arial and Impact. Whatever’s handy. And then what was handy became popular, and what was popular became the new standard.
And this is always the way. When the public gets tools, they use them, without regard for the rules that might have come before.
But there’s still a desire for craft, and people, particularly over 30, are eager to judge a book, not by its cover but by its type. Even if they don’t know why.
There will be a new set of standards for type, just as the quality of every folk innovation has improved over time.","July 2, 2021","Folk typography, type design, social media influence"
Use your hips,"There’s almost no sport or physical activity where that advice isn’t useful.
Golf. Ping pong. Dancing.
The more likely it is that people are tempted to focus on their hands or feet, the more the hips really matter.
And you’ve already guessed the metaphor.
The work we do needs a solid foundation. The biggest muscles are around the hips, just as the biggest leverage comes from our approach to cash flow, market presence and hiring.

If you wait until the market is telling you exactly what it wants, you’re almost certainly too late.

Is TikTok powerful?,"To be powerful, a medium needs two things:
The telephone reaches a lot of people, but AT&T has very little power because they have no influence over who makes phone calls.
Lots of people have Sony TVs, but it’s Netflix that has the cultural power because they decide which shows are promoted on the start screen.
People in the music business are flummoxed by the number of new acts that are showing up out of nowhere and becoming hits on TikTok. They’re talking about how powerful this company is.
But it’s not. It’s simply reporting on what people are doing, not actively causing it.
The folks with the power are the anonymous engineers, tweaking algorithms without clear awareness of what the impact might be.
Google and Amazon used to invite authors to come speak, at the author’s expense. The implied promise was that they’re so powerful, access to their people was priceless. But the algorithm writers weren’t in the room. You ended up spending time with people who pretended they had influence, but were more like weatherpeople, not weather makers.
Reporting the weather is different from creating the weather.
There are still cultural weather makers, but they might not be the people we think they are.","August 29, 2021","TikTok, power, algorithms"
Feature requests for monopolists,"I’d like Gmail to be smart enough to automatically skip the spam folder for any mail that’s coming from someone I just wrote to.

I’d like Final Cut Pro to allow me to watch the video I’m editing at a faster speed, the way all modern video playback permits these days. It would save hours and it’s got to be easy to implement. (Update:Fixed!)

The inevitable decline of fully open platforms,"The spammers have found Substack.
There’s a long history of useful tools on the internet attracting selfish con men.
Substack is a platform for bloggers who want paying subscribers. They’ve done the technical work and quiet lobbying to get past the promo folder and the spam filters, and as a result, a blog on Substack is going to reach more people and come with a veneer of respectability.
One option a company with a useful network has (whether it’s an email platform or a social network) is to curate what they feature. They’ve built an asset and that asset goes up in value when it attracts thoughtful users.
The other option is to believe that ‘open’ is the answer, the more open the better. As we learned when we launched Squidoo a decade ago, it rarely is. People in disguise don’t make good neighbors. A fully open platform inevitably attracts selfish jerks, who, without curation, begin to degrade the very asset that made the platform appealing in the first place.
Wikipedia used to be fully open, but persistent graffiti on useful articles meant that serious users were spending most of their time fixing what shouldn’t have been broken. Now, you have to earn the right to do certain edits to certain articles.
The tension is simple: If a platform is carefully vetted and well-curated, it meets expectations and creates trust. If it’s too locked down and calcifies, it slows progress and fades away.
Radio, TV and magazines have always been curated. Even the letters to the editor are read by someone before they’re printed. The magazines that went to the web and let just about anyone write on their sites ended up with sites that just about no one trusted.
Too much curation stifles creativity, opposing viewpoints and useful conversation. But no curation inevitably turns a platform over to quacks, denialists, scammers and trolls.
Over time, the value of a uniform, a brand or a platform is defined by the worst people who wear it or use it.
Trust and attention are in a long dance, but only trust wins in the long run.","August 25, 2021","open platforms, curation, trust"
Solving for stress,"If we’re hungry, the obvious solution is to eat something.
If we’re restless, it pays to get up and walk around.
Is stress different?
Along the way, it seems as though we got confused about the best way to deal with the stress that comes from work and from the projects we work on.
“Push through the stress and on the other side, everything will be okay.”
Simply get all the details right, get an A, get into a famous college, make the sale, polish the logo, do the pitch and then… reassurance will follow.
The reassurance of success or even survival. The reassurance of external acclaim or simply relief.
Now that everything’s okay, no need to be stressed!
Until the next time. Which might be tomorrow.
Reassurance is futile, because there’s never enough of it.
Some folks manage to get their projects done without this sort of stress. They’re not using the search for reassurance as fuel.
The solution to stress isn’t reassurance. It’s accurately understanding the world as it is, and making choices about what we do and how we do it. But far more than that, we relieve stress by making choices about the stories we tell ourselves.
What’s the difference between giving a speech to your dog and giving one on the TED stage? It’s the same speech. The difference is in the story we tell ourselves about the stakes, the opportunity and what might happen next. If that story gets debilitating enough, it can paralyze us.
If you’re on a backpacking trip, there’s little doubt that ten more minutes of tired to get to the next campsite is a smart investment. A little more tired translates into a lot more rest.
But if you’re at work, there’s not a lot of evidence that more stress is the best way to have less stress.
Look for the story instead.
[PS It’s not easy to change your story. For some people, and in some situations, it’s almost impossible. But that doesn’t mean that more stress in search of reassurance is going to make your search for a useful story any easier. If others in your situation have figured out a story that works for them, that’s a good sign that you might find one too. If no one has, changing your situation (if you can) might be the best way forward. But we need to get unhooked from the cycle of reassurance.]","August 24, 2021","stress, reassurance, mindset"
Which problem are we solving?,"Solving a problem puts value creation first.
Who’s it for?
What problem does it solve?
Would we miss it if you didn’t build it?
At the beginning of the web, companies grew by focusing on the problems that their users had.
As a result, people found a partner, a place to chat, a way to buy a book they’d been searching for, and yes, a chance to sell their Beanie Baby collection. They listed jobs and found them, sent messages around the world and looked up information they needed. There wasn’t always a business model, but the successful startups got successful because they were relentlessly focusing on solving a problem for the customer.
If it was hard to explain why someone needed what you were doing, you had a real problem.
This was the single best use of the venture money that flowed into the web twenty-five years ago. Patient investors said, “solve a customer problem well enough and the profit will take care of itself.”
In just a few decades, a lot of the straightforward problems found profitable outcomes.
Many small businesses run into trouble because they start in a different place–the question they ask is: how does the owner make a living? Serving the customer comes second when the owner is focused too much on sunk costs and bills due.
Over time, successful businesses figure out how to align their goals with the customers they serve.

“Can we get a puppy?”,"The internet is filled with puppy quandaries.
You can get a puppy at a pet mill/pet shop in about an hour (please don’t). But over the course of your lifetime with that dog, you’ll need about 3,000 hours of time and money to take care of him.
The same time/money math applies to doing a good job on any social network. It only takes a few minutes to sign up for an account, but most users put in just enough time to be wasteful and not nearly enough time to generate anything of value as a result.
Accepting international orders, supporting a different category of industrial customers, putting your customer service phone number on the box, opening a conflict or litigation–these are all puppy questions.

How many artists would mint NFTs if they couldn’t sell them? How many people would buy them if they couldn’t resell them?

The idea of the easy test is often ignored. Before spending three years in law school, why not get a temp job for a week at a law firm? Or spend a day reading depositions on file at the courthouse?

Time dilation,"You can read this post in six minutes. It took me more than an hour to write.
That extra editing and polish is a benefit to the reader.
You can read this post instead of 100 others, because people highlighted or shared or ranked or otherwise filtered the other things you might be reading. That curation created value as well.
The math here is compelling indeed: 1,000 would-be authors pitch books but only 30 get published. Each book takes a year to write but just six hours to read. And you didn’t read all thirty of them, just the one that had the best reviews… 10,000 hours of work by authors and editors to deliver six hours to you.
The time dilation of polish and curation is possible because of asynchronicity and the one-to-many nature of publishing ideas.
Asynchronous because you’re not doing it live, reading it as I write it.
And one-to-many because the work of a creator is multiplied across many readers.
A friend recently sent me a note via voice mail. It was 14 minutes long. Because he didn’t spend another ten or fifteen minutes editing it into a three-minute long email, he wasted a ton of my time. But the nature of 1:1 interaction meant that it was either his time or mine, even steven.
And listening to someone live, at an open mic nite or at a concert, promises wonderful surprise, but it also means that there’s bound to be a lot of dead time. Because no one is curating, and you have no selection advantage.
One of the surprising unsung benefits of the worldwide web and the organized sharing of information is time dilation. A benefit we constantly waste by seeking the more human habit of mindlessly taking what comes, in real-time instead.","August 17, 2021","Time dilation, curation, asynchronous communication"
Discipline vs. fairness,"What’s better, a fish or a bicycle?
That’s a ridiculous question, because they’re not opposites nor are they exclusive.
It’s tempting to come to the conclusion that discipline is on one end of a spectrum and fairness is on the other.
We see it in sports, business and politics all the time. A boss or coach is seen as a voice of discipline, right and wrong, certainty and power, while the ‘other side’ is all tied up in knots over what’s more fair.
But they actually don’t oppose each other. Fairness can be executed with rigor. Fairness can lead to productivity and efficiency. Fairness is actually what forward motion is capable of.
The opposite of discipline is actually laziness, and that’s often associated with fear. Fear of responsibility and fear of the truth. Responsibility and truth are required if we’re going to get on the right track.","August 16, 2021","Discipline, Fairness, Responsibility"

Speed bumps are real. They’re a warning, or they’re unavoidable, and they hurt. Speed bumps cannot be denied.

Often, the only difference between a speed bump and an obstacle is our decision about which one it is.

"Variability, industrialization and hating your job","50 years ago, Oldham and Hackman proposed the job characteristicsmodel. It so resonates with people that it feels like common sense: Job satisfaction is driven by five factors:
Task significance: Does the work you do create meaning or impact?Task identity: Do you feel ownership (emotionally) in the work you’re doing?Autonomy: Do you have the freedom to make choices?Skill variety: Is the task monotonous?Feedback: Are you in a place where you can safely and easily get feedback and use it to improve?
If you think about your moments of flow, or the pastimes and hobbies we choose, they have all or most of these elements.
And if you think about the most boring day you’ve ever had, or the worst job you had to do, it’s likely that most of these were missing.
And yet, even though it’s easy to show that these five factors are critical in attracting and keeping skilled and talented workers, many organizations work overtime to eliminate them. “I’m just doing my job” is the antithesis of what works for workers.
So why?
Because industrial systems hate variability. They work to mechanize as many steps as they can, and if forced to use a human, work hard to keep that human within very specific boundaries.
Better to have a three-hour Zoom call where everyone listens to the rules than risk having someone make a mistake, even one with no negative impact. Better to parcel out jobs to the cheapest available cog than depend on a linchpin to make a difference. And better to know in advance exactly what to expect.
The industrial system would rather settle for mediocre than suffer between moments of brilliance and occasional defects.
The solution is not surrendering to the system. It’s to realize that in a competitive marketplace, automating human performance is a shortcut to becoming a commodity. If you can automate it, so can your competitors.
Instead, we have the opportunity to do work that is unexpected, generous and original. It won’t be perfect, it won’t be the cheapest, but it will matter.","August 14, 2021","Job satisfaction, industrialization, variability"
The half-life of culture,"Jack Benny died when I was 14. He was an early radio and TV star, a comedian primarily remembered for just one line.
The other day, a peer said, “well, if you’re giving me a Jack Benny choice…”
It occurred to me that few people younger than us were ever going to use that reference. It ends with this generation.
YouTube and the net have extended the half-life, dramatically. Instead of TV shows or memes disappearing forever, they simply move to the back row of search. But they’re still there.
Will Pi Day or Rickrolls be a thing in 44 years?
There’s been an explosion in pop culture. I created a book a long time ago:The Encyclopedia of Fictional People. Today, there would be far too many to ever fit in a book.

Making a difference (making a point),"There are countless ways to make a point. You can clearly demonstrate that you are angry, smart, concerned, stronger, faster or more prepared than the person you’re engaging with.
But making a point isn’t the same thing as making a difference.
To make a difference, we need the practical empathy to realize that the other person doesn’t know what you know, doesn’t believe what you believe and might not want what you want. We have to move from where we are and momentarily understand where they are.
When we make a point, we reject all of this. When we make a point, we establish our power in one way or another, but we probably don’t change very much.
Change comes about when the story the other person tells themselves begins to change. If all you do is make a point, you’ve handed them a story about yourself. When you make a change, you’ve helped them embrace a new story about themselves.
And even though it’s more fun (and feels safe, in some way) to make a point, if we really care, we’ll do the hard work to make a difference instead.","August 12, 2021","empathy, change, communication"
Developing a picture,"That used to involve putting film or paper into a chemical bath. You could have a small influence over what happened, but almost all the work involved setting up the shot in the first place. The goal of the bath was to uncover what was already on the film.
Developing today has a totally different meaning. We’re not simply uncovering, we’re building. Software, careers, our culture–we develop them daily, adding a little bit at a time, toward the future we seek to create.","August 11, 2021","Development, Transformation, Creation"
Thoughts on your book cover,"(Or your logo, your house, your tie, your business card, your website…)
Like a suit or a skirt, it needs to fit. You’re going to be looking at it for a long time.
And you’re certainly going to look at it more than any other human will, so if it’s not perfect, don’t sweat it, that’s mostly a personal challenge.
The book cover should work at any size, because most people will see it before they buy it, and they will see it online, at just a one inch square size.
The book cover should not only reflect the genre it’s in, it should send a powerful signal within that genre.
One signal might be: It fits! I get the joke! This is what works, for example, in romance novels.If you’re looking for a book like this, this is a book like that.
Another signal might be: I know what sophisticated books look like, but this one is deliberately not that. It’s for people who don’t buy a lot of books. Something likeThe One Minute Managerbelongs here.
And a third signal, my favorite, is: I know what the genre looks like, AND this book is in that genre, BUT, this book is a bestseller and so it is stretching the boundaries in a way that only an important new book can.
It’s worth noting that your cover will almost certainly NOT sell even one copy of the book, but it can certainly unsell someone who might have considered your cover. So there’s not a lot of room for risky, daring maneuvers. You don’t need them.

Leveling up isn’t easy,"Once you’re in a slot, it’s harder and harder to move out of it. The status quo is here because it’s good at persisting.
One option, particularly if you’re on your own, is to take your development seriously. Instead of simply clearing the incoming and reacting to what’s knocking on your door, you can invest the time to learn and the effort to practice.

The two train illusion,"If you’re at the station, sitting on a train about to leave, you might notice that the train next to you is moving.
But, perhaps, that train is sitting still andyou’removing. It’s hard to tell. Without the lurch of sudden acceleration, the only clue we have is that our relative position is changing.
For most of us, it’s disconcerting–we know something is moving, but we’re not sure exactly what’s happening.

Limiting data in search of information,"Neil Postman pointed out that bureaucracies control the flow of information. A form, for example, has no room forallthe information, just the stuff that’s requested. It’s impossible to share all the information about anything, particularly at scale.
The deluge that is the internet is an opportunity and a problem. With a few clicks, we’re able to get more data. And there’s no end in sight, since new data is posted faster than we can consume it.
If you want to get better at astronomy, it doesn’t pay to get up to speed on all the books about gardening that you can find. Or texts on gambling, posts on the stock market or tweets about today’s political gambits. They won’t help you learn what you seek.
It’s easy to be in favor of more data. After all, until we reach a certain point, more data is the best way to make a better decision. But then, fairly suddenly, more isn’t better. It’s simply a way to become confused or to stall.
If you want more information, be careful about the data you seek out.","August 8, 2021","data limitations, information overload, focused learning"

The end of the office,"The office is a fairly modern phenomenon. We got by for millenia without them.
For a century, the office was simply a small room next to the factory or the store. The office was upstairs from the bakery, or next to the stockyard or the foundry. Proximity to the worksite was its primary attribute.
For the last fifty years, though, more and more office workers never actually saw the factory floor.
Office culture became a thing onto itself, with layers of workers supporting other workers who supported workers who  helped improve the productivity of the factory, whatever sort of factory that was.
And office culture was based on physical proximity. With most written communication taking far too long (a week for a letter!) and electronic communication insufficient in resolution, we built office towers to house the layers of office hierarchy that were evolving. We even named ‘the corner office’ after an executive’s physical location in the flow of information and power.
But then the factory was moved even further away–most big company CEOs have never even visited all of their factories, retail outlets or development centers. And if you have more than a few, it means that no matter where you are, you’re not at most of them.
And then email turned written communication into something instant and high resolution. Asynchronous messaging eliminates time.
And then Zoom meant that location didn’t matter much either.
Over the last 18 months, many of us have felt isolation as part of the dislocation from the office. Easily overlooked, though, is how much faster and more efficient so many systems became. Now, it’s not the communications system that’s holding us back, it’s our unwillingness to make change happen in concert with our peers.
Some organizations dealt with enforced work-from-home by using endless Zoom meetings as a form of compliance… a high-tech way to take attendance. But others leaned into the opportunity to create nimble, task-oriented decision making and communications hubs, ones that were no longer constrained by physical proximity.
The last forty years have taught us that the technology that most disrupts established industries is speed. The speed of connection to peers, to suppliers and most of all, to customers. The speed of decision making, of ignoring sunk costs and of coordinated action. The internet has pushed all of these things forward, and we’ve just discovered, the office was holding all of them back.
As social creatures, many people very much need a place to go, a community to be part of, a sense of belonging and meaning. But it’s not at all clear that the 1957 office building is the best way to solve those problems.","August 6, 2021","office culture, remote work, organizational change"
The specific yes and the meandering no,"When a change arrives, some people embrace it. And because it’s new, they have to be specific about why. They can talk clearly about the benefits it offers and why they feel drawn to the change it can produce.
But many people don’t embrace the change. And more often than not, their objections are diffuse. They change their story over time, sometimes within the same conversation. When one objection is overcome, they switch to another one. They embrace mutually exclusive arguments and generally appear vague in their discomfort.
That’s because the people who say yes are seeing and embracing what’s possible.
There are definitely specific nos as well. People who have considered the details and implications of a new technology or cultural shift and then declined to use it.
But that’s not a meandering no.
While some people reject a new idea simply because it doesn’t work for them, often the people who are saying no are afraid. They’re afraid of what change may bring, and they’re not sure they trust the innovation and the system enough to go forward. But we’ve been conditioned to avoid saying, “I’m afraid,” so if we’re uninformed and afraid, we make up objections instead. And even add angry bravado to our objections, simply as a way of hiding what’s really going on.
A meandering no doesn’t turn into a yes because someone with a good idea listened very carefully to every spoken objection and rationally and clearly countered it. Because the objections aren’t real, and the naysayer isn’t listening very hard to the responses.
Instead, the culture changes when a combination of two things happens:

The modern expediter,"Feet on the street.
At the same time that air travel is becoming less favored by businesses, the world is more connected than ever before.
There are lots of organizations that want to do business internationally but might not be as eager to fly across the world to visit a factory or meet with a supplier. And so the pharmaceuticals, the software, the fabrics, the call centers, the chips—it becomes ever more difficult to truly understand how to source and produce the components that world-based products demand.
The expediter is local talent. They speak the language. They are retained by the company to join in on zoom calls and to do site visits if needed. The modern expediter provides something that’s more useful than ever: insight.
My friendJojo does this in China. I’m guessing that there are others who do it in many other countries around the world, but they’re not easy to find.

You can watch the clock, but if you do, it’s watching you.
Clocks have an agenda. They aren’t a part of the human condition–they’re fairly recent. They enabled industrialism, and the very fact that they have an ‘alarm’ built in is a clue.

In between a total loss and an endless expense,"How much should you spend?
For just about everything, there’s level 1 (too cheap, total loss, all money and effort less than 1 is wasted) and there’s level 2 (spending ever more money to get not much more than investing at level 2 would have created.)
This rule applies to copyediting, to used cars, to the building of bridges and everything in between.
What’s the point of underspending on a software project? You merely end up with nothing but frustration.
And the gold-plated RFP that comes from deep within the bureaucracy is designed to avoid finger-pointing and blame, not to actually buy something that gets us a return–that might lead to even more waste.
Better to pay a little more than you should and get something you can use than pay too little and end up with nothing at all. Better as well to avoid paying a ridiculous amount for something that never satisfies–better to live without until you learn to see the curve.

"First come, first served","This is the default for allocating something that’s scarce.
It’s also rarely the fairest or most efficient alternative. And it’s sort of lazy.
I called a service provider yesterday and was told that they had a two-year waitlist.
They could sort the list by who needs what they do the most.
They could sort it by which sort of client would be the best fit.
They could even sort it by which client would allocate the most resources to be next in line.
Any of these choices would be more useful to them and to their clients than the semi-random solution of handing out numbers at the deli.
Itfeelsmore fair because we’re used to it. But it’s actually less fair to just about everyone involved.
When a luxury good is allocated based on time invested by the purchaser, it may seem that rewarding someone who stayed up all night to wait in line makes sense. After all, they traded the one commodity that everyone has the same amount of to signal their desire to be in the line.
But perhaps there’s someone who would put the item to better use. Or consider the utility of allowing people who want something to trade time spent as a tutor or in a food shelter for priority instead.

Not just wrong, but unhelpful, because by ignoring the stuff in between, we isolate ideas (and people) instead of seeing them as part of a continuous whole.

Because you used to be able to do ALL the reading. You could read all the essential science fiction books before you wrote yours. You could watch all the key movies before you directed yours. You could understand all the current thinking in a field of medicine before you prescribed a drug…

The Goldilocks fallacy,"One way to tell if the audience is happy is to ask a simple question: “Do you want it spicier?” (or the equivalent).
If half the people want it to go in one direction and the other half want the other, then you know you’re at ‘just right’. You’ve minimized the number of unhappy customers.
Here’s the problem: This assumes that there’s a normal distribution of preferences. In nature, many things are in fact distributed like this. Height, for example, or sensitivity to loud sounds. Most people are in the middle, fewer people are at either end. The goal when making something for everyone, if everyone is distributed normally, is to seek out the middle.
But!
Personal preferences aren’t normally distributed. Most people don’t care at all, some people care a lot.
And!
In any market with choices, you’re no longer going to be able to serve everyone, because given a choice, people will make a choice.
So, seeking the Goldilocks equilibrium is a trap. While it might diminish criticism, it maximizes apathy. While it might increase your appeal to a hypothetical middle-of-the-road consumer, it might be that there aren’t many of these.
For many products and services, the middle is hollowed out. What you’re left with are the people who want a lot more or want a lot less of whatever it is you’re able to adjust.","September 24, 2021","Goldilocks fallacy, preferences, market choices"
"When in doubt, look for the fear","My friend Amy taught me that “craven” doesn’t mean what I thought it meant. I’ve been using it to mean, “selfish in a particularly short-sighted way.” It actually means fearful and gutless.
But, exploring the thesaurus, I discovered that it also means “dastardly.” I was sure that Snidely Whiplash was a dastardly villain. A dastardly deed must be something bad.
Nope, it means “cowardly.”
But wait!
It turns out that it also means particularly selfish and evil.
When someone is fearful enough, craven enough, they sometimes end up acting in unsocial and even hurtful ways.
While there are definitely some super villains among us, it’s more likely we’re simply dealing with someone who feels like he’s drowning.

Defending change (or the status quo),"The easy argument to make is that the thing we have now is better than the new thing that’s on offer.
All one has to do is take the thing we have now as a given (ignoring its real costs) and then challenge the defects and question the benefits of the new thing, while also maximizing the potential risk.
“A hand-written letter is more thoughtful, more likely to be a keepsake, and a more permanent record than a simple email.”
On the other hand, the technophile defending change simply has to list all the new features and ignore the benefits we’re used to.
“An email is far faster, cheaper and easier to track than a letter. It is more likely to be saved, and it can be sorted and searched. Not to mention copied and forwarded with no problem.”
What’s truly difficult is being a fair arbiter. I fall into this trap all the time. We begin to develop a point of view, usually around defending the status quo, but sometimes around overturning it, and then the arguments become more and more concrete. While we might pretend to be evenhanded, it’s very hard to do.
Sometimes, we end up simply arguing for or against a given status quo, instead of the issue that’s actually at hand.
And the danger is pretending you’re being fair, when you’re not. In this sillyarticlefrom the Times, the author (and their editors) are wondering if oat milk and pea milk are a “scam.”
This is a classic case of defending the status quo. Here’s a simple way to tell if that’s what you’re doing: imagine for a second that milk was a new product, designed to take on existing beverages made from hemp, oats or nuts. Defending oat milk against the incursion of cow milk is pretty easy.
The author could point out the often horrific conditions used to create cow milk. “Wait, you’re going to dowhatto that cow?” They could write about the biological difficulty many people have drinking it. Or they could focus on the significant environmental impact, not to mention how easily it spoils, etc.
Or imagine that solar power was everywhere, and someone invented kerosene, gasoline or whale oil. You get the idea…
There are endless arguments to be had when new ideas arrive. The challenge is in being clear that we’re about to take a side, and to do it on the effects, not on our emotional connection to the change that’s involved.","September 22, 2021","change, status quo, argument"

"Gift cards, serial numbers and hard technology","I bought someone a digital gift card the other day. That’s generally a bad idea, since there’s so much waste and breakage, but it was the right answer to the problem in the moment.
The code the person would have to type in to redeem the card was: X5LMFP478DRYTHQY
I’m sure that the team who worked on creating a secure platform for the transfer of billions of dollars of transactions was proud of the hard work they did.
Except no one wants to type this in, and it’s incredibly impersonal.
It could have been just as secure if there was a list of 1,000 words and the code was five of the words. All the words could be positive and easy to spell and remember. Typing in “happy love birthday celebrate friend walrus” is going to be more memorable, fun and engaging, and the computer is smart enough to ignore the spaces.
The day before, the tech support folks at a different big company wanted me to read off the serial number on the bottom of a device. I’m sure the tech folks were proud of the check digits and other elements that were embedded in the serial number, which was printed in grey type considerably smaller than this blog is written in. It included a 0 and an O as well as a 1 and perhaps an l.
And the serial number for my oven requires lying on the floor to read it.
In all of these cases, the organizations failed because they decided that humanity and technical issues don’t overlap. These minor issues I’m complaining about are nothing compared to the life-changing impacts that technology that avoids the hard problems can create.
In medical school, they spend days teaching people to operate on lungs, and no time at all helping young doctors learn how to get their patients to stop smoking and get vaccinated. The technologists forgot about the human issues.
This is most glaring when we go near the edges of a bell curve.

The programmatic ask,"Favors are part of the glue of our culture. It’s not easy to ask for a favor, it’s not always easy to say yes, but when the two people engaged in this dance find a connection, it means something.
Alas, the modern hustle, amplified by databases and computers, has turned this equation upside down.
“It doesn’t hurt to ask,” the hustling spammer says, using second-order connections to “reach out” to hundreds of people. “No pressure,” they add, as if this diminishes the coarsening of the conversation.
If you ask 100 people for a favor to “get the word out,” then of course you don’t care so much if 80 or 90 people decline. The problem is that you’ve just hurt the relationship you had with these people (as thin as it was) as well as made it more difficult for the next person, the one who actually put some effort and care into making a connection.
The honest first line of the programmatic ask is, “I’m using you to get what I want right now, because I didn’t plan ahead, care enough or show up with enough generosity to do it the old way.”

Copy design,"Copywriting turns words into action.
But which words? And which action?
Often, copywriters take a strategy for granted. They don’t take the time to think about what this sentence or that paragraph might be for. They hesitate to describe the foundations of their method, and instead resort to time-tested tricks and phrases.
We have a word for the strategies involved in creating a product or service that fills a niche and solves a problem. That’s what designers do. The pretty part comes next (and it’s confusingly calleddesignas well, when it should probably be calledcraft.)
Design leads to leaps and breakthroughs. Craft ensures that great design accomplishes its mission.
Designing effective copy begins with the presumption that you can then craft the sentences that support that strategy.
But beginning with design ensures that good craft won’t go to waste.

Respecting their time,"When we go around the room and have each person introduce themselves, we’re burning time, attention and trust. 40 people: 45 minutes, gone. Worse—the person who goes first spends 43 minutes daydreaming, and the person who goes last spends 44 minutes worrying about what to say.
When we read our powerpoint slides to the audience, we’re sabotaging our message and wasting the attention that we’ve been granted.
When a school fritters away live classroom time requiring lectures instead of answering questions, they’re squandering precious real-time engagement. It’s far more productive to assign the lecture on video to be done at the student’s own pace.
When a conference organizer (remember conferences?) has people wait in a long line to check in instead of using a web-driven smartphone system, they’ve burned a million dollars in time and travel expenses.
One of the little-seen benefits of a networked world is that we’ve re-configured what needs to be done in a queue and what can be done in parallel.
The simple rule is: If this can be done on multiple tracks, at our own pace, it should be. If it creates a benefit when we all do it together, then let’s.
People have already decided that they’d rather watch a movie at home. But people who love the theater can’t wait to get back to it. That’s because only one of them is better together, in real time.
It’s much easier to demonstrate power (and to get a quick result) if we simply demand that people do it when we say. But the effort in creating a platform for interaction, attention and growth pays off.
We’re not just respecting people’s time. We’re respecting their voice and their passion.

Fuzzy type,"Digital typography always looks crisp. The words on our screen seem official, because they’re not the victim of sloppy or rushed handwriting.
But sometimes, we might be better off with a little less crispness.
Malka Older points out that polling data and predictions would probably be better understood if the graphs and charts were intentionally fuzzy. The less sure we are of the prediction, the fuzzier it ought to be.
For example:
The weather next Saturday is going to be crisp and clear, with no chance of rain.

And if it’s something we’re quite unsure about, better to set it like this:
The fact that we have to squint a little bit is far more effective than adding a disclaimer about our margin of error. If you’re not willing to make it fuzzy, it might be better to not say it.","September 10, 2021","Fuzzy typography, predictions, data visualization"
Speculation is the new luxury good,"A luxury good is one where the price paid is much higher than the apparent utility it offers. We pay extra precisely because it’s not a good value. The utility lies in how we and our peers think about it. The scarcity and bling of a luxury good are used to increase our status (in our own eyes and those in our cohort).
And so, a top-end Mercedes isn’t much better at being a car than a Hyundai is, it simply costs more.
As engineering has improved and knock-offs have increased, though, the two-hundred-year tradition of physical luxury goods is fading away.
One thing that’s taking its place is speculation.
An NFT has zero utility. It’s simply an entry in the blockchain that shows ownership of something that anyone could see for free.
But that in itself is a sort of luxury.
There are now hundreds of digital NFTs each worth more than a million dollars each. Just like Reddit stocks, they change in value dramatically, they come with a story and they’re fun to talk about with your friends and peers.
And one day, every one of them will be owned by someone who is unable to sell it at a profit.
Speculation is a great hobby if you can afford it, but it shouldn’t be confused with investment.","September 9, 2021","speculation, luxury goods, NFTs"
The modern curriculum,"We’ve spent 130 years indoctrinating kids with the same structure. Now, as some of us enter a post-lockdown world, I’d like to propose a useful (though some might say radical) way to reimagine the curriculum.
It’s been a century of biology, chemistry, arithmetic, social studies and the rest. So long that the foundational building blocks are seen as a given, unquestioned and unimproved. The very structure of the curriculum actually prevents school from working as it should.
I think that a significant shift is overdue. The one below could work for kids from the age of 6. It doesn’t eliminate the fundamentals of being educated, but it puts them into context. More important, because it’s self-directed and project-based, kids canchooseto learn, instead of being forced to.
We’re living in the age of an always-connected universal encyclopedia and instantly updated fact and teaching machine called the Net. This means that it’s more important towantto know the answer and to know how to look it up than it is to have memorized it when we were seven. Given the choice between wasting time and learning, too many people have been brainwashed into thinking that learning is somehow onerous or taxing.
Introducing the modern curriculum
The basic foundation is student-centered, self-directed projects. In service of learning to solve interesting problems and how to lead as well as follow. And to support that, the “courses” are practical tools students can use on their projects.
Statistics–seeing the world around us clearly and understanding nuance, analog results and taxometrics (learning how to sort like with like). Realizing that everyone and everything doesn’t fit into a simple box. Learning to see the danger of false labels and propaganda, and the power of seeing how things are actually distributed.
Games–finite and infinite, poker, algorithms, business structures, interpersonal relationships, negotiation, why they work and when they don’t. We all play them, even when they’re not called games.
Communication–listening and speaking, reading and writing, presentations, critical examination and empathy. Can you read for content? Can you write to be understood? Can you stand up and express yourself, and sit still and listen to someone else who is working to be heard? What happens when we realize that no one is exactly like us?
History and propaganda–what happened and how we talk about it. Morewhythan when. The fundamental currents of human events over time.
Citizenship–Participating, leading, asking and answering good questions. As a voter, but also as a participant in any organization.
Real skills–Hard to measure things like honesty, perseverance, empathy, keeping promises, trust, charisma, curiosity, problem solving and humor.
The scientific method–understanding what we know and figuring out how to discover the next thing. Learning to do the reading and show your work. There’s no point in memorizing the Krebs Cycle.
Programming–thinking in ways that a computer can help you with. From Excel and Photoshop to C++.
Art–expressing yourself with passion and consistency and a point of view. Not because it’s your job, but because you can and because it matters. Appreciating the art that has come before and creating your own, in whatever form that takes.
Decision-making–using the rest of the skills above to make better choices.
Meta-cognition–thinking about thinking, creating habits with intention.
Here’s my question: If you could work for someone who had these skills, developed over the course of a decade or more of public school, would you want to? What about working next to them, or having them work for you? Or dating them? Or living next door or voting for them?
If this is what we need and what we value, why aren’t we teaching it?","September 8, 2021","modern curriculum, student-centered learning, project-based education"
Intentional connection in the digital office,"The virtual office skeptic says, “we can’t go fully remote, because the serendipity of personal connection is too important.” The theory goes that watercooler conversations and elevator encounters add up to an emotional bond. Add to that the happy coincidence of overhearing a conversation where you have something to add or seeing something on a colleague’s screen, and the case is made for bringing people back to a building.
Of course, what it overlooks is that in any building with more than 200 square feet of space, you’re only bumping into a tiny fraction of the people who work there. If they’re on another floor, or across the street, they might as well be in another country for all the serendipity that happens.
[I recently talked with a CEO who was incensed by the stories (hyped by the media) of people who had finagled their way to two full-time jobs while working remotely. Apparently, if you spend a lot of time managing your calendar, faking your zoom calls and living in fear, you can get away with it for a while. Perhaps one in a thousand workers pulls this off. Better to worry about embezzlers, I think, because if someone is focused enough to pull off the two-job trick, they’re probably aware that all of this energy is better spent in other ways. But I digress…]
The real challenge of remote work isn’t that it somehow erases the mysterious serendipity of magical office collisions. The problem is that making connections digitally requires enrollment and effort. If we do it with intent, it actually worksbetter.
We can collaborate in real-time on shared documents with people we’d never be able to meet face to face.
We can have a six-minute impromptu brainstorming session and have it transcribed to a shared doc–anytime we have the guts to invite the right people to the right platform and say ‘go’.
We can share a screen when we get stuck, and we can share it not with the closest person, but with the best person.
And yes, we can deliberately take five minutes off to have a one on one conversation with someone at work about nothing in particular.
The real magic of connections at the office was that we were having these connections without trying. It’s not that they were better, it’s that they were effortless.
But they didn’t work for everyone in the same way. They often reinforced status roles and privilege. They were unevenly distributed and didn’t usually appear when we needed them. All of which added up to a new layer of stress for many people.
No, we’re not sharing donuts. But if we put in the effort, we can share more than that.","September 7, 2021","intentional connection, remote work, digital collaboration"
Creativity and leadership,"They’re related.
Management isn’t. Management uses power and authority to get people to do tasks you know can be done. Management is needed, but management is insufficient.
Leadership is voluntary. It’s voluntary to lead and it’s voluntary to follow. If you’re insisting, then you’re managing…
And creativity is the magical human act of doing something that might not work. If you know it’s going to work–then it’s management.
Akimbo (a now-independent B corp that is pioneering cohort-based learning) has proven that creativity and leadership can be learned. They’re learned by doing, not by lectures.
Consider the legendaryaltMBA, now in its sixth year. The First Priority Application Deadline is tomorrow, September 7th for altMBA’s January 2022 session. Learn to lead by doing the work.

Simple connection tools,"The Rolodex and the Filofax disappeared a while ago, but we’re still not all using the tools that make it easier to coordinate people and time.
I useCalendlyto book various kinds of 1 on 1 discussions. I set it up to have access to certain windows in my calendar. Then, I just send the link (for example, to the 15-minute zoom call) and the other person can pick any time that works for them. Done. No back and forth.
I useStreamyardto have conversations with one or two people that can be recorded or broadcast live on social media. This is a great substitute for a live Zoom meeting where you’re asking your entire team to watch a conversation as it happens. By sending them a recording instead, they can watch it at their convenience and even speed it up or watch it again.
I have found thatDoodlesaves a ton of time when you’re trying to organize five or ten people to a coordinated live meeting or call. Instead of the endless circle of guesses, there’s a simple grid and people vote for what’s workable. It’s still not seamless, but it works.

Negative marginal cost,"Marginal cost is how much extra you’ll need to spend to serve one more customer.
The marginal cost of a hot dog is pretty low–if you don’t have to account for rent and labor and insurance and the rest, one more hot dog might only cost 15 cents to serve.
On the other hand, the marginal cost of a custom pair of shoes is pretty high, because the labor and materials are expensive.
The internet is transformative because so many things have a zero marginal cost. It doesn’t cost anything for WordPress to add one more user. And it doesn’t cost me anything to have one more person read this blog.
But…
When we factor in the magic of the network effect (things that workbetterwhen more people are using them) it turns out that the marginal cost isn’t zero. It’s actually negative. That means that it’s expensive for an online service to havefewerusers.
Moving from expensive to cheap to free to “it’s a bonus to add one more person” changes our economy and our culture forever.","September 3, 2021","Marginal cost, network effect, zero marginal cost"
Urgent cultural change,"Culture doesn’t change (much). Elements of human culture have been around for 100,000 years, and it persists. In fact, its persistence is a key attribute of why it works.
People like us do things like this.
In the last ten years, the culture has changed dramatically. We’re buffeted by shifts that are faster and more widespread than anyone can recall.
The combination of media, illness, technology and climate have made each week different from the one that came before.
Even early adopters and news junkies are becoming fatigued in the face of so much, so often.
And this persistent shifting in the foundations of our culture is sharpening the rhetoric and resolve of folks who would rather things stay as they imagined they were.
Our conversations and arguments about how we react to changes in the culture do little to change the forces that are shaping our future, though. Change persists whether we asked for it or not. Wishing and insisting won’t get us back to a world that’s static.
Our response to change is often all we have control over. And the way we respond is how we create the next cycle of culture and possibility.","September 2, 2021","cultural change, persistence, response to change"
We get what the business model wants,"The model for TV in the 1960s was three major networks supported by mass advertising. And so the shows that were produced were banal, reassuring and fairly inexpensive to produce. The goal was simply to keep someone from watching the other two channels.
The business model in the Netflix age, with multiple streaming channels racing to gain market share among affluent consumers with a surfeit of choice, is fundamentally different. And as a result, so is the content being produced.
It’s not that the TV people wanted to watch suddenly changed–it’s that the economic model for delivering it did.
The business model for news has changed, and so the news has. Not what’s happening in the world, but the way the internet reports it.
The business model for all the lifestyle (health, gossip, etc.) filler we see has changed as well. And so it goes…
And for many people, the biggest change is this: the business model of social networks has replaced the simple act of being in community.","September 1, 2021","business model, content evolution, media change"
"New problems, old problems","Most of the challenges we face are things we’ve faced before. It might be a personal situation or a business one, but it’s not new.
If what you’ve done before works, it’s not a problem any more.
If you need to stick it out because there’s no other way through it, it’s not a problem, it’s a situation.
But if you think it’s a problem, then the hard work is deciding to try something new, as opposed to the predictable but unsuccessful path of doing what you did before.
That’s not the same as the challenge we face when a new problem arises.
A new problem doesn’t need fresh thinking, it needs clear awareness. We can begin by acknowledging we have a problem, identifying the constraints, the boundaries and the assets involved.
And then we can go to work to solve it.

The point of maximum leverage,"The best way for a movie studio to outperform is to attract and encourage creators with vision, drive and commitment.
And yet, the key executives might be spending their time and focus and effort on micro-managing the end credits on the next movie or setting up a press junket.
The best way for a marketing team to grow sales and market share is to help design a product that uses a network effect and builds remarkability and engagement right into the item itself.
And yet, the team just spent three hours arguing about where to shoot the next commercial.
That small business will probably be most transformed by creating sell-through and market demand for their new product, But it’s overwhelmingly urgent to focus on a shipment that’s delayed, even though the supply chain can’t be fixed.
It goes on and on. For a job search, fixing your resume isn’t nearly as important as shipping a personal project. For a restaurant, creating a reason to come back with friends is more important than getting all the normal things right…

Effort toward quality,"Quality is defined as consistently meeting spec. A measurable promise made and kept.
Effort is what happens when we go beyond our normal speed. When we dig deep and exert physical or emotional labor and focus on something that is out of the ordinary. Effort is the opposite of coasting.
Often we’re taught that quality is the result of effort. That if you simply tried harder, you’d come closer to meeting spec.
And yet, when we look at organizations or brands or individuals with a reputation for quality, it’s not at all clear that they accomplish this with more effort. Because that’s simply not sustainable.
The people who work at a Lexus plant aren’t more tired at the end of the day than those that make the Cadillac Escalade. It’s not about effort. The same is true for the Dabbawalla who never misses a delivery. In fact, focusing on effort (and the effort of your team) is almost guaranteed to ensure that your quality problem will persist.
Persistent quality problems are a systemic issue, and if you’re not working on your system, you’re not going to improve it.

Entitlement,"A feeling of entitlement is hard won.
You suffered to get to this spot. You were mistreated. You worked hard. You paid your dues. You were treated unfairly. It’s your turn. Justice demands it. You’re aggrieved. Or perhaps the thing you’ve worked so hard on is magical, special and totally worth people’s attention.
Like I said, you’re entitled. To your grievance or the meeting or even simply, the benefit of the doubt.
Alas: Our entitlement isn’t helpful.
Feeling entitled doesn’t make it more likely that others will listen to you, do what you ask or respect you. Feeling entitled doesn’t get you a sale or make it easier to merge into moving traffic, no matter how long you’ve been waiting.
So yes, you’re entitled. We all are, sooner or later.

Customer service is free,"(Customer service is expensive)
Of course it’s expensive. You’ll need to hire people inclined to be empathic and kind. You’ll need to provide systems and training and support. You’ll need to avoid shortcuts and treat people better than the minimum required to get through the day. And you’ll need to trust your people to do what’s right.
But all of that expense–it’s the cheapest way to spread the word about what you do.
Great customer service pays for itself.
There are many situations where no customer service at all also pays for itself. Google spends not a nickel on helping people with many of the services they offer… and the money they save is spent on something else that permits them to grow.
It’s the in-between spots, the choice of low customer service, or nearly enough–that’s when it’s simply a waste of time and money.
The single biggest marketing bargain remains a customer who chooses to recruit new customers.","October 25, 2021","Customer service, cost, marketing"
Sunday driver,"There’s a road near my house that was built early in the automobile era. It was built so that early adopter car owners would have something to do with their cars–a parkway that went nowhere in particular, perfect for a Sunday drive.
Along the way, the term “Sunday driver” has become a criticism. It describes a meandering, purposeless driver. A driver who might be watching the scenery instead of paying attention to the road–someone who rarely yields the right of way and probably causes more than a small number of accidents when surrounded by drivers who are in a hurry.
We went from Sunday driving being the point to it being a hindrance, because the road is hard to share.
The digital world we live in was created and populated for Sunday drivers. It’s only in the last two decades that, like expressways, it has become a center of commerce and industry.
But unlike the scarcity of the road, the digital world has lots of space.
There are several internets. One is filled with hobbies and connection and possibility. And sometimes we confuse it with the other one, the one that’s at the center of our commercial life.
Most of the time, internet Sunday drivers don’t bother anyone, and perhaps we can all learn a lesson from their desire and ability to make the journey worth the effort.","October 24, 2021","Sunday driver, digital world, internet culture"
Art with intent,"Art (movies, plays, fiction, paintings, poetry…) exists to create a change. Often, that’s a change in the viewer, and sometimes, powerful art changes the culture.
Art with no intent can entertain us, and it can also reinforce stereotypes and simply help what is in our world persist.
Art with selfish intent exists to manipulate the viewer to serve the needs of the artist. It doesn’t often spread, but when it does, it can have a corrosive effect on the world around us.
But art with generous intent is different. It might not address an issue the way you would (in fact, that’s precisely why we need it) and it creates tension as it helps us look at things in a new way.
The plays of Sarah Jones,or abook by Sinclair Lewisormusic by Charles Wilsonor amovie by Amy Koppelmanexist to make us think hard. To think about what we’ve taken for granted and to think about what might be different if we cared enough.
I’m not sure it even matters what the artist thought they wanted when they sat down to create the work. The art itself seems to want something, to make a change in the world. And the ability to create art like that belongs to each of us.","October 23, 2021","Art, Intent, Change"
Afraid of afraid,"We’d probably be better off if we could simply say, “I’m afraid.”
Our culture has persistently reminded us that the only thing to fear is fear itself, that confessing fear is a failure and that it’s better to lie than to appear un-brave.
And so we pretend to be experts in public health and epidemiology instead of simply saying, “I’m afraid.”
We fight possible change from the start instead of examining it on the merits.
And we make uninformed assertions about the causes and implications of global phenomena instead of acknowledging that change is scary.
Fear of being afraid keeps things on our to-do list forever, keeps important conversations from happening and shifts how we see our agency and leverage in the world.

The other mindset is rare indeed. Do things that might not work. Develop new assertions. Go past the edges to unexplored territory. Try to figure out why things are the way they are. Fail often. Blaze a trail. After all, it’s a test kitchen, not a Michelin restaurant.

It’s easy to believe that things are dramatically better when there’smore.
More customers, more employees, more market share.
And it’s easy to believe that getting to the next sustainable level is simply the result of efforts similar to the ones that got you here.
But neither is true.
Between this level and the one you seek there may be a slog that’s longer, more difficult and more expensive than it appears.
Staying at a scale that’s working isn’t a cowardly copout. It might be the single best way to do work that matters for people who care.

Effort,"Insufficient effort creates work that’s wasted. If you do a slapdash job, then the roof leaks, the food is inedible, the car doesn’t start. Insufficient effort is a shortcut that wasn’t worth taking.
Sufficient effort is the goal of the industrial capitalist. Capture the most value with the least work. Build a house that doesn’t fall down, with components that last exactly long enough to avoid a claim. Explain that due to unusually call volume…
And then, perhaps, there’s a third option.
Expending more effort than most people think is sufficient.
This is attention to detail. Care in design. Follow through in customer service. This is an embrace of elegance andwabisabiand the opposite of laziness. This is bringing care (which is rare and precious) to work even if most people would look for a shortcut instead.

Contagious commerce,"Early adopters change the world.
While one person choosing not to eat meat will have a small impact on our climate, it will have a much bigger impact on the restaurants, groceries and food suppliers who notice what you’re doing.
They’ll change what they offer, and that will lead to a multiplier effect of other people changing their habits.
Buying an electric car or installing solar before they’re the obvious economic choice has the same impact. Because once marketers and investors discover that there’s a significant group that likes to go first, they’re far more likely to invest the time and energy to improve what’s already there.
The same goes for philanthropy. When some people eagerly fund a non-profit with a solution that’s still in beta, it makes it easier (and more likely) that someone else will start one as well.
It also happens in the other direction. If we buy from a spamming telemarketer, abandon a trusted brand to save a buck or succumb to the hustle, the market notices.

Swap the line,"Here’s a business idea for you, feel free to build it if you’re interested.
Don’t waste a waiting list
The waiting list has value, and it’s also a source of frustration.
There are people waiting for delivery of a new car, or to stay in a popular airbnb or to buy a limited edition jigsaw puzzle. There are people waiting for an appointment or a reservation or a handmade luxury good as well. Or let’s say two companies are waiting for a shipment of computer chips. One has a few left in stock, the other needs them to finish a high-value product that serves people in life-threatening situations…
On one hand, it feels fair. The people ahead of us in line got there before we did. On the other hand, perhaps someone behind us needs or wants our slot way more than we do…
Swap the Line is a simple smart-contract-based system that makes it easy to trade your spot in line. Pay money to someone who wants the cash and you can swap with them. Sell your spot for more than you think it’s worth. Stay put if you want to.

An organization with a waiting list enables swaptheline.com
They onboard with two simple steps:
If you’re ready to swap yourself to a different spot on the list, simply enter how much you’re willing to pay to go how far on the list. Or enter how much you’re willing to take to swap with someone behind you.
Perhaps there’s a list of bids and you can grab one, or perhaps it’s done automatically.
Either way, the system simply updates the waitlist in the cloud and transfers the money.
Some percentage of the transaction goes to the host, and some percentage goes to swaptheline for running the smart contracts and user interface that makes it work.
There’s a popular jigsaw puzzle company that has a six-month waiting list for a chance to buy one of their $200 jigsaw puzzles. If they kept 15% of the swaptheline percentage, it’s easy to see how they could double their profit at the same time that they served their customers better–because no one buys or sells a spot on the line unless they want to.
Or consider the 50,000 people now eagerly awaiting news about their new Rivian pickup truck. The truck costs $70,000. The deposit to get on the line was $1,000. A person could swap their spot at #100 to someone who is #18,000 and probably make enough to pay for half the car. And if even 10% of the line did a swap at an average price of $6,000, Rivian would earn $5,000,000 in profit simply by giving their customers what they want. The rigidity of the line is a sort of tax that ignores the market.
Or perhaps it’s something more civic-minded. The organization could allocate their percentage, perhaps they set it at 50%, for a local charity. It could easily replace a fundraising gala or two…
This is one of hundreds of examples of the impossible things an always-on network can do, things that feel odd at first and then obvious.

Shift your tech time horizon,"Ten years ago, if you were as good at using networks and software as you are today, most of your peers would have considered you some sort of wizard.
The question isn’t whether or not each of us is going to get better at using our tools, the only issue is: how soon?
We can choose to live behind the curve or ahead of it. It turns out that there are significant rewards for pushing through discomfort and getting (much) better at all the resources that are suddenly freely available in data acquisition, learning technologies, financial tech, marketing and networks.
What if instead of resisting until we had no choice, we decided to pioneer instead?

Life by anecdote,"“What evidence would you need to see to change your mind?”
The honest answer to this question is usually: “I need a new story that’s more immediate, more vivid and most of all, more culturally aligned than the one I have now.”
It took humans 100,000 years to invent the scientific method. Before that, we lived our lives by stories, examples and the urgent.
We still do.
An anecdote is not evidence. But we often treat it that way.","October 10, 2021","anecdote, evidence, storytelling"
“In it together”,"That’s not what we usually hear. To have “us” we often need “them.”
To make a profit (or a commotion) in social media, the math is usually division, not addition.
And as media has crept into every corner of our lives, it often thrives on discord.
The irony is that the network effect that powers our culture (it works better when others are using it too) depends on connection.
When Stewart Brand put a picture of the Earth from space on the cover of the originalWhole Earth Catalog, it was a revelation for many. The photo was new, but the image was also a timeless reminder of how futile it is to forget the very nature of our finite world.
Ideas can spread and multiply, creating new opportunities and new frontiers. But we’re still on the same planet, no matter how much a few people spend to go (almost) into orbit.
As we begin to move beyond a century of industrialism, all of us are coming to grips with the impact that the industrial engines we depend on have created. The chronic shift in the climate of the entire planet is going to be the most significant driver of change of the next twenty years. For all of us, not just a few.
Unlike current events or politics, this is neither local nor temporary. It’s hard to fight the weather, as it changes all of the inputs and the outputs of our life.
The first step is to realize that we’re in it together.
In the old days, when I was a book packager, I created a series of bestselling almanacs. Almanacs have been around since Benjamin Franklin, and even in the age of the web, they serve a useful function. Collecting relevant tables, facts, explanations, lists and history in a format that’s easy to reference and share gives us a chance to agree on what we agree on, a common foundation for moving forward.
I’m putting together a worldwide team of people who are interested in volunteering to contribute to the newCarbonAlmanac. It’s a zero-profit venture, a group effort designed to create a print and digital document that fills the vital niche between the cutting edge and apathy.
There are currently 40 of us, from 20 countries, working on the early versions. If this is something you have the time and inclination to contribute to, I hope you’ll take a minute to fill out thisquick form. We’ll be inviting some folks to join us next week.

Superfamous,"Among painters, poets, writers, actors, bloggers, directors, influencers, capitalists, fundraisers, politicians and singers, you’ll find a few who want to go all the way to superfamous.
They understand that their work won’t reach every single human, it can’t. They’re okay with that. But they’d like to reach just a few more people than anyone else.
Back when the New York Times bestseller list mattered, they worked to be on it. Not just on it, but on top of it.
Back when 100,000 followers were seen as a lot on Twitter, they hustled to be in the top spot. And when it got to a million, then that was the new goal.
Pop albums used to sell millions of copies. Now they sell in the tens of thousands. But one more than just about anyone else is enough (for now).
The desire to be superfamous might come from a good place. The work is important, it deserves to be seen by more people. The work is arduous, and reaching more people with it feels appropriate. The work is measurable, and measuring better is a symptom of good work.
Or the desire might come from the same drive that pushes people to do the work in the first place. Bigger is better, after all.
The problems with superfamous are varied and persistent.
First, it corrupts the work. By ignoring the smallest viable audience and focusing on mass, the creator gives up the focus that can create important work.
Second, the infinity of more can become a gaping hole. Instead of finding solace and a foundation for better work, the bottomless pit of just a little more quickly ceases to be fuel and becomes a burden instead.
Trust is worth more than attention, and the purpose of the work is to create meaningful change, not to be on a list.",,"superfamous, fame, meaningful work"
Lucky charms,"We’d rather not claim luck. Good luck feels like something was unearned. And bad luck sounds like an excuse.
The false promise of meritocracy decries luck in all its forms.
And yet…
Among famous colleges, perhaps one in five qualified applicants are admitted. Here’s what that means:
The school could make a list of every student who is ‘good’ enough to get in. The combination of background, test scores, grades, activities, all of it. Every student who, under some circumstances, would be happily admitted.
They could send a note to every one of those students telling them that they are finalists, and now, a random number  generator is going to pick 20% of them.
Because that’s what they’re actually doing anyway.
If you got rejected, perhaps it would be better to know that you were a finalist and then you got unlucky, instead of blaming yourself and some imagined defect.
And the same goes for countless things that happen to us in our lives. That I was lucky to get that first TED talk. That I was unlucky to not get that big meeting years ago…
Giving credit (or blame) to luck makes it easier to get back to the hard work of making things better.","October 5, 2021","luck, meritocracy, rejection"
Tasks or initiatives?,"For the longest time, just about all jobs were task jobs.
Factory work.
Inbox then outbox.
The assembly line, the ticket taker, the cook…
We learned how to hire for these jobs, measure them, manage the work to be done. Over time, we’ve figured out how to outsource them, mechanize them and pay as little as possible for them.
But in many pockets of our economy, the new jobs and the best jobs aren’t task jobs. They are jobs of initiative. Work that’s taken, not simply assigned. Work that can’t be easily forecast, and work that thrives with a different sort of teamwork.
These jobs often have a lot of task work mixed in, which is really confusing for everyone involved. Because reverting to task work feels safe and hiring for task work is easier. Apparently, people are supposed to learn how to do initiative work on their own and do it in their spare time.
Most organizations do an astonishingly bad job at creating, initiating and dancing with the next thing. And so they struggle and eventually become Yahoo.

Predictability,"We’d like the systems we depend on to do what we expect and need them to do.
A useful component of that sort of system is that there’s a bedrock set of expectations, principles and boundaries that exist before and after we encounter it. The drawbridge operates because of the rules of physics, not because an invisible elf decided to open it in this moment.
There are two kinds of situations, then. One in which we’re dealing with a predictable system with expectations about how and why things happen, and the other in which explanations might be suggested after the fact, but they’re justifications, not explanations or principles. In the irrational system, explanations are often made up after the fact and changed as soon as they’re scrutinized.
Both kinds of systems make up our world, but the first kind, the civilized, effective, mature kind, is the type we can build our world around.
We can state the rules and play by them. We can outline a theory and prove it.

The oracle,"Resistance often shows up insisting that it can predict the future.
The voice in our head, the one that knows everything, also knows that you will be rejected, that the work will be misunderstood, that you’ll end up shamed.
Not just the voice, but the circle around us can do this as well if we choose to listen. Wearing the hat of the ardent supporter, they will try to protect you by predicting the demise of that next thing you were pinning your hopes on.
And it’s easy (and tempting) to give them credit for soothsaying because they know so many other things. They (“we” if we count the voice) know all about the failures and disappointments of the past. They know all about the hard work and all about how others have stumbled. And so, of course, they must also know about the future.
A lesson from a koan is really valuable here. Voices that purport to know the future–whether they are psychics, astrologers, family or the noise in our head–are pretty effective when it’s vague enough, but terrible when it comes to specifics. That’s because when it’s vague, we complete the story on our own, creating our own fact patterns after things happen.
The simple question to ask the oracle is: I have a handful of beans. How many are there?
As much as we might want an oracle, there aren’t any. What we need, it turns out, are supporters who trust us and have our back.","November 29, 2021","oracle, resistance, support"
A Scrabble hack,"It’s definitely a regular pastime of mine, and one of my favorite games. I usually play solo with the Word Master app.
The structure of the game rewards knowledge of really short words like qi and aa, but the exciting part happens when you find a seven-letter word…
The hack that would work if you’re playing in real life, with other people and actual tiles: On every turn, each player is allowed to turn one of the letters in their rack over and treat it as a blank, which could be any letter of the alphabet.
Suddenly, possibilities multiply! The number of 7 letter bingo words explodes. Instead of wrestling with 7 dependent variables, you have 6 and a wildcard.

Finding your voice,"Not your metaphorical voice. I mean your actual voice.
It’s pretty clear to me that our speaking voice is not the result of the inevitable physical evolution of our vocal cords. It’s something our brain figured out how to do with the part of our body that keeps us alive by breathing.
And because it’s a late addition, there are a bunch of kinks in the system.
Talking while breathing is the beginning of the challenge.
But it’s also worth noting that the entire process is in the middle of a huge number of sensitive muscles and nerves. This means that when we’re talking (calling attention to ourselves) we’re also trying to keep all of that stress at bay. Add microphones, Zoom, and the high-stakes world of being seen, and you can start to understand why it’s so easy to get hoarse, to sound like someone you’re not, to develop tics, to amplify your stress, and a whole host of other challenges.
If you don’t sound like you, it might simply be because your brain is sabotaging the thing you’re trying to say. I used to riff about “no one gets talker’s block” but now I’m not so sure. I think most of us do.
If you’ve experienced any of this, I encourage you to find agood voice coach. Not because you’re some fancy keynote speaker about to go on the TED stage. Simply because you have something to say and it would be nice to be able to say it without pain. It’s easier than ever to have a few sessions remotely, and many people I know have found it life-changing. You can find someonenearbyor even watch somevideosto get started.

So many accidents,"The ones we notice are the negative ones. The time we slipped and hurt our knee, or the lingering illness that won’t go away. The gig we didn’t get, or the friend who is afraid or lonely.
But we’re surrounded by positive accidents as well, too many to mention. And often, we forget to mention them.
To be born when and where we were. To have people who give us the benefit of the doubt. To have a chance to read and to speak and to connect. To be surrounded by opportunities that others never even dreamed of.
And then, given those opportunities, the efforts expended and the care extended. The belief we have in others, the smile we offer or the contributions we make. All toward community and possibility.
I heard from two of my oldest friends yesterday, as well as from a dozen new ones. I met each of them accidentally. Every event opens the door for another one.

Marketing as a service,"Some folks think of marketing as something that is donetopeople. A hustle, a hype, a stealing of attention.
We need a name for that, but I don’t think that’s marketing.
On the other hand, calling dinner, “cold dead fish on rice,” while accurate, doesn’t really help people enjoy their sushi.
Human beings aren’t information processing machines. We’re not hyper-rational or predictable. Instead, we find joy and possibility in stories, in connection and yes, in tension and status roles as well.
When you care enough to see your audience with empathy, you’ll realize that they’re not happier if you simply recite a list of facts. Almost everything we engage with is a placebo at some level, and bringing a human-friendly story to the interaction is a way to serve people.
We need to not only have the ability to imagine what others see, we have to have the guts to go where they are and talk with them on their terms.
This means that we’re willing to be wrong on our way to being useful. We need to make assertions and show up with consistency, making promises and keeping them. Promises not just about the atomic weight of nitrogen, but about experiences and expectations that are sometimes hard to pin down.

A freelancer’s dilemma,"What do you own?What are you really good at?What do you enjoy?
Engaging with the marketplace requires creating value for people who have a choice.
And deciding what to offer your customers is your choice.
If you own something (a patent, a building, a process, a set of relationships) you can create more value than if you simply start over with new work each time.
If you are really good at something, having amassed skills and a reputation, it’s more likely that you will earn the benefit of the doubt and more easily create value.
And if you focus on being on the hook for work you actually enjoy, your days are better and it’s easier to do great work.
The freelancer’s dilemma is to figure out what to say instead of, “you can pick anyone and I’m anyone.”

The thing is, the digital wandering is mostly a waste. It doesn’t free our imagination, it stifles it. It’s as if this digital version of a tree has making us stressed out as a goal…

The expertise gap,"Just about everyone knows how to drive a car. Very few of us know how to build one.
For almost all of history, expertise wasn’t really a factor. If you were raised with the other hunter-gatherers, you were pretty good (good enough) at building a fire, maintaining a hut, hunting and gathering…
But as we built more complex devices, expertise started to arrive. You could tell people that you knew how to sail a boat (or build one), but it was pretty easy to separate those who had hard-won experience and expertise from the others. Either the boat reached the port or it didn’t.
The one thing that everyone is the world’s expert on is their own feelings. In just about every other area that we value, though, there are people with proven expertise, who can show their work, understand the state of the art and produce testable and measurable results.
“Experts” are part of the problem. An expert is someone who has expertise, but sometimes, they forget that past expertise doesn’t mean that they’re always right. When someone with expertise blindly supports a status quo and fails to engage in a relentless search for better, they aren’t showing expertise, they’re simply being a human.
Folk wisdom is priceless. It’s the sum total of shared human experience, usually around our emotions. But folk wisdom is not the same as folk expertise.
I think that most of us, faced with a troubling diagnosis of cancer, would prefer to find the person with the most expertise, not someone who had done a bunch of googling for twenty minutes…
And yet, particularly with the amplification of social media, there’s a devaluing of expertise. Politicians, sure, but regular folks as well. People who assert insight into anthropogenic climate change, public health or the toxicity of medical interventions. People who are sure they can understand the fine print of a 10K or analyze the approach of an athlete. Everyone is entitled to feelings about things, but expertise isearned.

“The car you were hoping to buy, it’s here.”
The other way to do it is to try to persuade someone that what they thought they wanted is incorrect. That can cause real change–it’s leadership, not simply fulfilling an established need.
But to do that, we need to find something in the other person’s set of desires and beliefs that doesn’t have to change. “You’ve always wanted to do the right thing, and you thought the right thing was X, but now I’m hoping you’ll see it’s Y.

First, I hope you’ll consider the freeThanksgiving Reader. It’s a PDF you can print and share at the event. For years, people have been using it to go around the table and give friends and family a chance to speak and connect. I’m thrilled that it’s already touched more than a million people.
Second, perhaps today would be a good day to share some of those unused Frequent Flyer miles.This organization is well on the way to collecting abillion milesto enable families to have a fresh start before the end of the year. It’s surprisingly easy to donate miles that the airlines are hoping will expire, and see them used for a good cause. I’m giving away two copies of the out-of-print 18-poundtitanto people who enter my littlesweepstakescelebrating this project.
Readers of this blog are well on the way to donating more than a million miles. [Update: More than 2.5 million miles from this blog so far, thank you.]
Thanks for leading, caring and connecting.","November 12, 2021","Thanksgiving, connection, donation"
Your big idea,"No one is going to steal it. Not if it’s actually a big idea.
One thing that big ideas have in common is that they’re almost impossible to give away.
You could have bought Amazon stock for lunch money, been an early backer of Acumen, financed part of Spike Lee’s first movie, had front row seats to Hamilton, bought BTC for $2… you get the idea. Even insiders usually take cash instead of stock options. And early customers almost never race out to build a competitor.
When big ideas show up, almost no one sees what’s possible. All they notice is that change is risky and new stuff might not work.
Don’t worry so much about someone stealing your ideas. In fact, it’s probably worth working harder to get people imagining that they might.","November 11, 2021","big ideas, innovation, risk"
School vs. progress,"“Will this be on the test?” is a question invented by industrialists. It’s the cornerstone of traditional schooling at scale, because it is such an effective way to indoctrinate kids to become cogs in the system.
And it’s almost an accident that we manage to make progress, because we’ve spent so much time encouraging citizens to maintain the status quo:
Follow vs. lead
Copy vs. innovate
Authority vs. responsibility
Compete vs. cooperate
Comply vs. invent
Answer vs. ask
Correct vs. possible
Fast-growing organizations and bold leaders want to hire people who have the second skill in the table above. And yet we’re working overtime to encourage the first.

The thing about the oxygen mask,"It feels odd to hear the flight attendants remind us to put on our own mask before helping others. That’s backward, isn’t it?
The theory is that if you can’t breathe, it’s probable that you’re going to have a hard time lending a hand.
In our daily lives, the oxygen mask might be metaphorical, and the insecurity/threat might be invented, but it still feels real.
It’s worth remembering that the next time someone doesn’t act in a way you expect. It might be that they’re having a little trouble on their own, trouble you might not even be aware of.","November 9, 2021","self-care, empathy, support"
Optimism is a tool,"We generally adopt a posture of optimism or pessimism as a response (or reaction) to external events. We see how things are unfolding and make a decision about what to expect. We feel like we need to justify our response based on the facts on the ground.
But that doesn’t actually explain why different people, similarly informed, might adopt an optimistic mood or a pessimistic one.
In fact, that mood is a choice. And it’s one that determines how we’ll behave.
Optimism is a tool that permits us to solve problems more effectively. If used wisely, it brings enthusiasm, inspiration and hope to projects that benefit from them.
[And pessimism is a tool as well–it can help you with budgeting, scheduling and other projects. If it works for you, that’s great. Choose your tools wisely.]
As a universal default, either mood will certainly lead to misguided energy and poor decisions. But if we can be thoughtful about optimism as a tactic, the focus and energy it brings can solve problems that others might simply walk away from.
Our pessimism might not be an accurate diagnosis of the past. It might simply be a tool we’re using to produce a future we’re not happy with.","November 8, 2021","Optimism, Pessimism, Decision-making"
Kinds of projects,"At first, we sold our labor. That was 10,000 years of history. You traded sweat for food.
Eventually, people figured out that they could build an organization. And an organization made things, which someone could buy. Add some technology and machines and productivity would go up, the things would get better, and profits would result. Industrial capitalism. This is the sort of project that most people think about when someone says “I’m going to start a business.”
But there are other options.
Linux and Wikipedia and the local farmer’s market are all projects. They may or may not lead to a profit for every person who engages with them, but they’re distinct entities that organize various talents and inputs and create value for the people they serve.
Stemming climate change, stopping the spread of disease and fighting homelessness are also projects. They may not have coordinating bodies or a single entity, but they represent a combination of ideas, people and initiatives that are coordinated through culture.
Bitcoin is a multi-trillion dollar project with no one in charge.
As our world gets more connected, the projects that change us are more and more likely to have a form that would be hard to recognize just a generation ago. But inventing and choosing and supporting these projects is now on us, and it begins by recognizing that they even exist.","November 7, 2021","Projects, Innovation, Value"
What’s the appropriate resolution?,"If you don’t ask the question, you probably won’t get the answer.
The microwave in my office has a button that says, “add a minute.” That’s not helpful, as there are plenty of items that need thirty seconds or ninety seconds, neither of which is possible if all you can do is add a minute. On the other hand, “add five seconds” would be a waste, because no one wants to press a button 18 times. The appropriate resolution for a microwave is either fifteen or thirty seconds.
On the other hand, it doesn’t pay for the readout on a radar gun to be a tenth of a mile an hour. Given its accuracy and the need for proof, five miles an hour is probably fine, and one is just the right amount of apparent authority.
Should you be measuring your call center team’s performance on a given interaction on a scale of one to a hundred, or is one to five more reasonable?
Often, we don’t even bother to ask.","November 6, 2021","resolution, measurement, performance"
"Truth is elusive, but it isn’t evasive","There is almost certainly life on other planets in the universe.
And, by definition, there are flying things that are difficult to identify.
But it doesn’t follow that unidentified flying things are spaceships with aliens in them.
There are definitely conspiracies all around us.
And, by definition, organizations often do things that are difficult to explain.
But that doesn’t mean that all of those actions are the result of a conspiracy.
The modern era of UFO-ology began in 1947. UFOs as in aliens in ships, not in the obvious statement that some objects we encounter aren’t identified yet. In the seventy years since the aliens came on the scene, our ability to take photographs has become significantly more widespread and the quality of those photos and videos is incomparable to what we used to have.
And yet the pictures of UFOs haven’t improved.
People who used to see things in broad daylight in their backyards suddenly stopped seeing them as soon as they got an iPhone.
One way to tell that you’re dealing with a story instead of falsifiable science is that the story changes when evidence is brought to the table. (Falsifiable means that it can be proven false. “I’m thinking of a unicorn” is not falsifiable, because I can change my story if I need to.)
That’s because we’re humans, and humans embrace stories. There are countless good reasons to believe in the possibility of UFOs and other conspiracies. But evidence that holds up to scrutiny andOccam’s razorisn’t one of them.
If we’re not prepared to change our minds in the face of a test that demonstrates the opposite, then we’re embracing a story.
Crop circles and Bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster are useful stories. But they’re also busy evading our ability to find them. If someone gives a new excuse every time there’s better data about medicine or other useful technology, it’s a clue that we’re hearing a story, not a scientific debate.
Truth is hard to find. Truth is difficult to understand when it arrives. But truth doesn’t work to evade us. It usually stays still until we find it.","November 5, 2021","UFOs, conspiracies, truth"
Who will criticize your dreams?,"I hope you have dreams. Dreams are precious, and they open the door for what happens next.
Some dreams are tactical. They’re very specific executions of a possible future, designed to create a certain kind of happiness.
And some dreams are strategic. They might be short on specifics, but they help us understand exactly the change we seek to make in the world and the way it might make us feel.
If your dream is to be a vaudeville star working nightly at the Rialto on Broadway, that’s specific and tactical.
If, on the other hand, your dream is to pursue your craft in front of an audience that appreciates you and makes it possible for you to do it again, that’s strategic.
The more we talk about them, the more tactical they become, as if a dream doesn’t count if it isn’t imminent.
But getting the strategic part right is far more important. The feeling and contribution you’re going for, not what it looks like on your resume.
The problem is that people are often terrible at helping with your dreams.
Perhaps you might get lucky and find someone who cares enough about you that they’ll happily give useful feedback and advice about your tactical dreams. What a precious gift. They’re celebrating your journey at the same time they’re helping you see how you can improve the tactics you’ve chosen.
Tactical dreams are almost certain to never work out the way we hope. We need all the help we can get to understand what we’re actually hoping to accomplish and why. We need to learn to see the strategy behind the tactics we’ve chosen. Because once we can settle on a strategy that works for us and the audience we care about, our tactics can change over time.
Too often, we believe that the first set of tactics we’ve settled on is our true calling, the only way to accomplish our dream. And then we get trapped, and turn away from those that might help us figure out what we really need to be focusing on.
On the other hand, folks who criticize your strategic dreams might mean well, but they’re probably keeping you from making a real impact. To protect you, they pull you down instead. They’re hoping to prevent you from failing at anything. That’s not helpful.
It’s easy to get confused and to simply hope that people will cheer us on, regardless of how realistic our tactics are.
But if the people around you are afraid to criticizeanyof your dreams, you’re likely to find yourself in a tactical bind one day soon.","November 4, 2021","dreams, tactics, strategy"
The next big idea,"There are two confusions. The first is that the next big idea must be fully original. The second is that it have no competition.
This is almost never the case.
Henry Ford didn’t invent the car, and there were plenty of social networks before the dominance of Facebook. Madam CJ Walker didn’t invent haircare, and Ray Kroc definitely didn’t invent the hamburger or the french fry.
The same is even more true for thriving, important local businesses of manageable size.
The future of all of these types of organizations isn’t based on a lack of customer choice. It’s based on customer traction.
When there’s a compelling reason, often due to execution, care and people (combined with a network effect), then a new organization can thrive. Because people want what it offers.
Once you realize that you’re not looking for something original and alone, you have countless options. Because the opportunity is to simply solve a problem, to show up in the world with leadership and generosity and make things that people choose.
The hard part is showing up to lead.
We’ve been indoctrinated to join a ‘safe’ venture instead of seeking out something worth leading.
And that’s the reason that innovations often stall. Because it’s easier to be skeptical than it is to say, “I’m leading.”
And the reason that projects often fail in the early stages is because leaders can get scared of competition and choice, when it’s actually competition and choice that are the symptoms that you’re on to something.
In the middle of all the trauma and change in our lives, we are all on the cusp of a huge multiplication of new business models, new funding models and new ways of being in our communities. If you’ve been waiting for a moment to start a project bigger than your own hourly contribution, this is truly the best moment I can recall.","November 3, 2021","innovation, leadership, competition"
Let’s vote on it,"Voting with a capital “V” is fraught. It happens rarely, it’s fairly permanent and thus momentous. We bring identity and media and politics into a swirl, spending billions of dollars to create something that feels both fruitless and participatory at the same time.
Voting uses a 5,000-year-old method to, in a tiny moment of time, have people raise their hands and make a choice.
These sorts of Votes are a ceremony that adorns the way we govern.
But Voting with a capital V actually confuses us about the power we each have to speak up in all sorts of informal ways. We vote (with a small v) every time we discuss who to invite over for dinner, what sort of car to buy, and particularly when it comes to work and commerce, how we’ll accomplish anything as a team.
And technology, which has made it easier than ever for us to collide with other peoples’ ideas (and to collude with them), hasn’t done much to institute useful new ways to vote and to be heard. And when we feel heard, we’re far more likely to connect and commit.
Instead, we rely on traditional status roles, on caste, on signals of strength. We rarely adequately reward wisdom or a good track record when making these decisions, and often the decisions that are confirmed create more team divisions instead of building connection and resilience.
What if we could build a voting layer into our teams and our culture?What if it were community-based, resilient and easy to use? And what if that voting layer allowed us to create new forms of value, new projects and better ways to connect and decide?
For the last year, I’ve been noodling on a plan for a DAO that creates the conditions for a new form of widespread tally. Dozens of really smart and passionate people helped me think about the tech and the implications. The plan I’m sharing below is filled with examples, traditional ideas, new technologies, cultural shifts and a different way of changing the culture while building a layer of the internet.
But this is bigger than me. As I’ve written about before, describing the project and running it are very different things… It needs dedicated leaders ready to commit to building something for the long haul. So I’m publishing the idea here, giving it away and hoping that many people around the world will copy it, improve it, develop it, share it and make it work far beyond what I’ve described.
Here’s the plan for Pluralism. And the published webversion. (Static backupversion).
Make it yours. Have fun.

Leadership is a choice,"It’s such an odd thing to say.
The benefit of the doubt is withheld from many of us, options are unevenly distributed and indoctrination is real.
And yet… no matter where we begin, we each get the choice, every day, to choose to lead.
It’s tragic that the brainwashing runs so deep that we’ve hidden that choice from many people. But it’s there, in areas big and small.
My friends at Akimbo continue to open doors for people who are ready to make that choice. The altMBA’s Regular Decision Deadline is tomorrow, November 2nd for the upcomingaltMBAJanuary 2022 session.
And Thursday is the last day to enroll in the next session of the legendaryStory Skills Workshop.
The world is changing faster than it ever has before, and we can choose to lead those changes or simply follow them.","November 1, 2021","Leadership, Choice, Change"
“You’re either with us or against us”,"This is almost never true.
For just about any issue, behavior, company or movement, the vast majority of people are neither. They might be unaware, they might be unconcerned, they might have a different priority list.
Forward motion happens from two things:
First, creating synchronized, persistent action among the people who are with you.
Second, creating a path where some of the inactive decide to join you.
Insisting that someone choose sides might feel like the satisfying and urgent thing to do, but it rarely leads to enrollment and action.",,"sides, action, enrollment"
Don’t waste the good days,"If you’re feeling creative, do the errands tomorrow.

Which errors to focus on?,"So many missed opportunities. Decisions not made, errors in judgment, opportunities lost.
Perhaps you didn’t buy Google stock at $80, didn’t buy ETH at $5, didn’t buy that winning lottery ticket… You also didn’t take that course in college, or go out of your way to meet that person on campus or learn Spanish when you had the chance.
But most of the time, those aren’t the things we’re obsessed about. Instead of these huge opportunities not seen, we think about the near misses, the ones we had some sort of proximity to. As if the emotional proximity to a choice is the thing to feel badly about. So, instead of thinking of the $10,000 we didn’t make by buying a certain equity, we think about the $10 we affirmatively lost by leaving it on a counter. Instead of thinking about a breakthrough paper we didn’t write, we worry about a typo we made in a brief years ago.
One is thousands of times more expensive than the other, and the amount of effort in each is the same, but our minds focus on the one where we feel like we had more responsibility. Which causes us to focus even more on the wrong sort of decision in the future.
The roads not seen almost always matter more than the potholes we hit along the way.","December 30, 2021","opportunity cost, decision-making, regret"
The two choices for anyone with a new idea,"“It’s simple.”
“It’s complicated.”
When you talk to someone about your new idea, they’re going to realize right away that it’s one or the other.
The trap is trying to pitch a complicated cultural shift, possibility or project as if it’s simple.
Darwin’s insight about how the world evolved is simple once you understand it, but it represents such a conceptual leap that bringing it to someone who’s looking for a simple and easy explanation is sure to fail. But if you invite someone along for a journey instead of a quick fix, you earn the right to take your time and tell your story.
Some non-profits are simple, “there’s an earthquake, and these people need food right now.” Some are complicated, “we can create a significant, permanent change in the culture by treating people with dignity so that they can live fuller, more complete lives.”
The simple/complex trap often confuses well-meaning people in politics, business and the arts. The solution isn’t to dumb down the complex. The solution is to invite the right people along on the journey.","December 29, 2021","simple vs complex, idea pitching, cultural shift"
Choice vs. convenience,"You have more than a billion choices online. With just a few clicks, you could be just about anywhere. Thanks for reading this today.
What did you have for lunch yesterday? Of all the lunches in all your possible universes, was it your first choice? Best choice?
When someone tries to take our freedom of choice away, it’s a problem. And yet…
We have far more choices than we realize. In school, we’re bound by the course catalog, the schedule and the requirements of a degree, but even there, we had more freedom than we imagined. The organizations we could have started, the projects we could have launched, the people we could have connected…
It’s convenience that holds us back. And it comes in many forms.
Social convenience:it’s easier to sit through a boring cocktail party or a meeting than it is to tell someone you don’t want to come.
Physical convenience: things that are handy are much more likely to be chosen than ones that require us to move somewhere to go get them.
Intellectual convenience:change makes us uncomfortable. Sunk costs are hard to ignore. Possibility comes with agency, and agency comes with risk.
Financial convenience:if it’s cheaper in the short run, we’re more likely to choose it, even if it costs satisfaction, opportunity or cash in the long run.
Cultural convenience: A combination of all of these, because culture likes the status quo and reminds of this regularly.
If we ever saw precisely how much freedom of choice we have if we were willing to sacrifice convenience for it, we’d be paralyzed. But if the choices we’re making now aren’t helping us live the way we choose, it might be worth taking a hard look at why.

Best behavior,"If we’re new to a situation, or feeling unsure, we pay careful attention. We’re closely examining how others feel, what the cultural norms are, and what impact we’re seeking to make.
On the other hand, sometimes we fail to be on our best behavior. That’s another way of describing impulsive selfishness.

Value capture (and the minibar),"No one freely buys anything unless it’s worth more than it costs.
And so, in a competitive market, organizations will compete to capture as little value as they can afford to, offering the most surplus to the customer, because that’s how they can grow and thrive.
And monopolies (and organizations that would like to profit as they do) work to create situations where the customer has no real options, so they can capture almost all the value that’s created.
That’s why nuts at the minibar cost so much. The goal is to price them a penny less than they’re worth to the traveler in that moment.

If you decide to become a coach, realize that most of your prospects will be people who don’t think they need a coach. (Because the people who want and need a coach already have one).
If you attract new freelance business by being the cheapest, I’m betting that your customers will give you a hard time about your rates.

They’re ungracious, unkind and even vulgar about it.
The first problem is that it earns them little in the way of sympathy or kindness from people who believe that they ought to be behaving better.
And the second problem is that the person who’s acting churlish knows that they have little reason to take umbrage and that makes it even harder to feel better.
When we feel like a churl, the best path could be to head for gracious humility and kindness instead. It might not work, but it works better than any other option.","December 22, 2021","churlishness, kindness, humility"
Intricate systems,"Over time, every system becomes increasingly complex. That’s because in order to make it better, we tweak it. We add exceptions. We do things that are urgent, essential or smart for a particular use case. We learn from what’s broken and we fix that broken spot.
New projects can’t possibly be as intricate as old ones. And so the campus at Oxford is going to be very different than a vocational school in a new building.
When we start a new system, it doesn’t pay to comment on the lack of patina, elegance or special case handling. Of course a new system can’t do any of those things. The part that’s worth noticing is the efficiency and design of the structure itself. Is it extensible? How will it respond to the need to become more customized, resilient or user friendly?

Novacula Occami,"Ockham’s razor is really useful: Generally, the simple explanation is the most likely to be true. Don’t invent complicating factors when none are necessary.
“It’s simple” is probably correct when describing how any individual mechanism works.
[For example, UFOs are unlikely to be piloted by aliens from light-years away, who just happened to show up in that period in between our invention of airplanes and the widespread use of digital cameras. It’s far more likely that they’re simply unexpected events that we turn into complicated stories.]
On the other hand, systems–where there are multiple mechanisms at work–are almost never simple. In those cases, it might be more useful to understand that, “it’s complicated.”
When an unexpected event occurs, we look for stories, coincidences, supernatural causes and other forms of solace to explain something that frightens or surprises us. But unexpected events are usually caused by simple mechanisms.
How we react and respond to these events as a culture, on the other hand, is complicated indeed.","December 17, 2021","Ockham's razor, simplicity, complex systems"
And when is the shift over?,"If you sell your time as the measure of the work you do, the work is over when the shift ends. Clock in, clock out.
If you sell your output as the measure of the work, your work is over when the inbox is empty. Once you’ve made all the pizzas that were ordered, you’re done.
But more and more, our work can be endless. One more sales call might lead to one more sale. One more cycle of innovation might lead to the breakthrough we’ve been looking for. One more post might get you the traffic you’re on the hook for.
In a competitive marketplace, self-regulating the length of our shift is a lot to ask. Given that the list of things to do is intentionally endless, it’s on each of us to decide what ‘enough’ looks like.

Blaming the weather is a trap,"“If it were only nicer out, I’d be happier.”
That’s just a step away from, “If the current world crisis would abate, then I’d be able to concentrate.”
Which is not that far from, “If you would simply behave, I wouldn’t be upset.”
When we focus on external forces and tie them directly to our state of mind, we’re giving up agency.
The hard-won privilege of being in control of our own status and peace of mind.
Without a doubt, there are situations that are unfair, abusive or dangerous. And we should work to fix them or walk away if we possibly can. However, we don’t have to link these external forces to the way we choose to talk to ourselves. We can decide to claim possibility and take action instead.
Roz Zander teaches us to avoid, “I’m on vacationbutit’s raining.” It’s far more powerful and useful to think, “I’m on vacationandit’s raining… what should I do with this moment?”
The story we tell ourselves belongs to us and only us. It’s entirely possible that someone selfishly or thoughtlessly put a story there. It’s possible that there isn’t enough empathy or fairness or opportunity. But once we see that we’re able to own our story, we gain a huge amount of power. And we retain that power for as long as we refuse to hand it over to someone else.

Write a better spec,"If you’re asking someone to work for you, help you or advise you, it turns out that being specific about what success looks like is an obvious way to get better results.
If everyone can agree on what success looks like, you’re more likely to achieve it.
And yet…
And yet we prefer to say, “I’ll know it when I see it.” We’re vague, murky or even contradictory about what we want.
The reason is simple: If you write a great spec, we get to blame you if it doesn’t work out.
The vagueness is a way to hide.
If you don’t know what you want now, what makes you think you’ll know what you want later?

Someone to take care of it,"“If I could just find someone to handle all the sales, I could get back to work.”
“Do you know someone who can do all of the investments, accounting, taxes and strategies around money?”
“Why do I have to spend time managing people, I want to get back to creating.”
I hear this from busy creative entrepreneurs, soloists and creators often.
If someone who cared as much as they did, but was focused and good at something like accounting or sales or management could just join in, life would be so much better.
A consigliere!
A proven partner who is not only trustworthy and skilled, but works cheap and is available to work at the scale of a small team’s operations. Someone able to work full time, or at least focus their full energy, the way you do.
Well, when you put it that way, it’s pretty clear why this is a tough role to fill.
If that superstar salesperson is so good, why on Earth would they want to drop everything and work to build your fledgling operation? Part of being a superstar salesperson is being smart about what you sell–and most of the time, that means picking things that are easier, more obvious and at a larger scale.
The same goes for the money folks. Money is money, and if you’re good at managing it, managing more of it is probably on your agenda.
There are two takeaways from these sobering truths:","December 13, 2021","sales, accounting, entrepreneur"
Secret conspiracies and public systems,"It’s tempting to believe that powerful people and organizations are conspiring in secret to cause mysterious or unfair events to occur. The conspiracies supposedly involve dozens of people working across many time zones in complete secrecy.
That’s unlikely. Unlikely because cooperation of this sort is hard to find, especially among the powerful, and because it’s essentially impossible to keep it a secret.
What’s actually happening, right in front of us, all the time, is that systems are causing uncoordinated actions to occur. When banks, for example, create a cycle of more debt and higher interest rates for students, they didn’t need to have a secret meeting to pull that off. All they did was act within the system that they’ve built for themselves. When companies race offshore to pay ever less in taxes, no one coordinated that. It was a ratchet, a system that rewarded a race to the bottom. And even though the NCAA is an organized entity, it’s the system that has driven up the pay of college head coaches, not a secret conspiracy.
If we’d like the world to work better, more fairly and with more of a long-term view, we have to identify the systems that push participants to do the opposite. And then we need to consistently and persistently work to change the incentives that cause the entities in those systems to act the way they do.","December 12, 2021","conspiracy, systems, incentives"
Cultural half-life,"Things decay.
We know precisely how manyyoctosecondsit takes for half of a given amount of Hydrogen-7 to transform into ordinary hydrogen. And we know how old old things are because Carbon-14 loses half its mass every 5,700 years.
But ideas and cultural impact have a half-life as well.
Einstein wrote a paper 120 years ago that is still being discussed. It certainly had more of a cultural/scientific impact when it first arrived, but it lasted.
To Kill a Mockingbirdhas more cultural relevance today than a bestseller likeThe Bridges of Madison County, even though both were bestsellers at their peak. There are ten-year-old posts on this blog that still get a lot of traffic, and ones from a few weeks ago that are unlikely to be seen much in the future.
When marketers or leaders or artists show up to the culture with an idea, the immediate goal is to find traction and to change things. But the choice of medium, message and persistence have a lot to do with how long that impact will last.
Of the half a billion tweets that are tweeted every day on Twitter, perhaps a handful have a half-life of a year or more. Most fade away in a few yoctoseconds.
On the other hand, a peer-reviewed scientific paper probably has a higher average half-life. Darwin is still going strong.
Over the last few decades, there’s been a relentless move toward the yoctosecond–more ideas, lasting a shorter and shorter amount of time.
I’m not sure that we benefit from that, and if there’s a mismatch between how much work and focus an idea requires and its half-life, you’re likely to be disappointed.
Plan accordingly.","December 11, 2021","Cultural Half-Life, Ideas Impact, Persistence"
The Wizard and the Prophet,"This is my book of the year.
It delivers on so many things that we want a book to do–it could never be replicated by a website or even a film.
The audiobook is even better… It’s engaging, powerful and resonates really deeply.
Mann has given us a deeply researched narrative, a book that will change the way you see just about everything in the natural world and its relationship with humanity. It’s about an epic struggle and mostly, about our future.
It seems to be about two obscure characters of the 20th century, but it’s not. It’s about each of us and the tools we can choose to bring with us to the future. I found myself switching camps every few minutes.
I am taking notes on every page, and I mention the book in most of the conversations I have.

Do you have a tuner?,"Piano tuners have a vital job… and very few pianists do that work themselves.
Who maintains your tools?
Perhaps it’s a computer with all the software that goes with it. Do you have a world-class pro, someone who is up-to-date, skilled, innovative and empathic making sure that they’re working well? Or are you doing it yourself, muddling through?
If we have mediocre tools, why should we expect great work?
Or perhaps it’s not the software or the hardware that needs tuning. Perhaps it’s our attitude, our approach to work, the way we deal with possibility…

Accuracy and precision,"They’re not the same.
Precision brings granularity to measurement. You can drive around 50 miles an hour, or you can drive 54.7 miles an hour with precision.
But accuracy is how we describe doing what we intended to do. Driving in the wrong direction with precision isn’t much help, when accuracy in describing the goal would have been a better plan.
Most organizations spend their time on meetings about precision, instead of taking a few cycles to choose to be accurate instead.","December 8, 2021","Accuracy, Precision, Measurement"

The pyramid of modern marketing,"In most pyramids, the top gets all the attention, but it’s the foundation that truly matters. Marketing is no exception.
The base of the pyramid, the most important layer, is INTENTION.
What change are you seeking to make? Does the team have clarity, measurements and resources to prioritize this?
Intention comes with design thinking. Who’s it for and what’s it for? Have you identified the smallest viable audience and built a product and created and designed a service infrastructure around it that works beautifully for this audience?
Your story is intricately linked with your intention. If you don’t know who it’s for and what it’s for, the story can’t resonate.
A story doesn’t work when it’s your story. It works when it becomes their story.
Then comes RETENTION. Because existing customers are worth far more than new ones. If you are constantly losing the folks you worked so hard to attract, you’ll have to work even harder to find people to replace the ones who just left.
And then comes REMARKABILITY. The conversations that happen as the result of your work. The network effect is the most powerful force for growth that most organizations ever encounter, but people aren’t going to talk about your work unless they believe it will help their goals to do so.
If you’re fortunate and focused, retention and remarkability will earn you PERMISSION. The privilege of delivering anticipated, personal and relevant messages to the people who want to get them. This is the asset of the future, because building and maintaining teams to spam the world is exhausting.
And then, only then, do you have the ability to focus on tactics, words and images. What’s the narrative that engages with people eager to join you on this journey? Where is their status? What sort of affiliation do they seek?
Finally, in tiny print, hardly worth mentioning, are hype and hustle and the rest. Ignore them if you can. By volume, by priority, by effectiveness, this is nearly worthless noise, despite the fact that it gets so much attention from pundits who have rarely successfully marketed much of anything.","December 6, 2021","Intention, Retention, Remarkability"
Perhaps it’s worth throwing it out today,"If you’re considering putting an unmarked key into a drawer filled with keys, you’re better off simply throwing it out instead.
Not only won’t you be able to find that unmarked key when you need it, but you’ve just made it more difficult to sort the other keys as well.
We hesitate to embrace or announce failure right now, preferring to put it off to some indeterminate date in the future. But postponing the announcement isn’t the same as not failing. It simply makes things worse later. And being clear about the failure we’re about to cause someday makes it more likely we’ll do the work to avoid it.

Do you feel rich?,"It’s not the same asbeingrich.
Rich is always relative. Compared to your great-grandparents, we’re impossibly, supernaturally rich. We have access to information and technology that was unimagined a century ago. At the same time, compared to someone ten miles away or ten years in the future, we’re way behind.
Two people with precisely the same resources and options might answer the question of ‘rich’ completely differently. Because money is a story.
The neighborhood or industry or peer group you choose has a lot to do with whether you’re relatively rich or not.
After a stock market adjustment, billionaires give less to charity. They still have more money than they can count, but they’re not as rich as they used to be, and not-as-rich is easy to interpret as not rich.
Which means that for many people, feeling rich is a choice.
If that choice encourages us to be imperious, selfish and a bully, it’s probably best to avoid it.
On the other hand, if choosing to see our choices, chances and privileges as a path toward generosity, long-term thinking and connection, then we can do it right now.","December 3, 2021","richness, perspective, generosity"
Customer service is free,"Most large organizations would disagree.
They hire cheap labor to answer the phone. They install recordings to mollify people who are on hold for hours. They measure the cost of the call center and put loopholes in the warranty.
When you see customer service as a cost center, all of these steps make sense. Any money spent lowering costs seems to raise profits.
But customer service is actually a profit center, for four reasons:
First, because the customer who calls you or shows up at the adjustments window is fully enrolled. Unlike just about every other moment you’ve had with them, in this moment, they are paying attention, leaning into the situation and on high alert. Everything you do here, unlike just about every other marketing interaction you have, will go on your permanent record.
Second, because your competitors have foolishly decided to treat this interaction as a cost, the chances that you can dramatically overdeliver are pretty good. You can’t make a car that’s ten times better, but you can easily produce customer service for your car customers that’s ten times better than what most manufacturers deliver.
And third, because in our industrialized economy, people love to tell stories about service. And so the word spreads (or doesn’t) based on what you’re about to do.
Finally, it’s been demonstrated again and again that the most valuable customers are the loyal ones. While your promotional team is out there making noise to get you new customers, you’d be much better off turning your existing customers into repeat customers and ambassadors.
And so, the money you spend on customer service isn’t simply free. It actually repays you many times over.","December 2, 2021","Customer Service, Profit Center, Customer Loyalty"
Chief Apology Officer,"Companies are discovering that hiring people to mollify critics and disappointed customers is cheaper (in the short run) than changing things, learning from the feedback or even wasting the time of people who do the ‘real work.’
The CAO doesn’t participate in tactical or strategic discussions, and probably can’t explain the dynamics that led to a given policy, or why it’s difficult to change. That’s not their job.
Their job is to make the customer or critic feel heard enough that they’ll accept the status quo without further fuss.
This is the tech support person who’s not allowed to acknowledge that the software has a bug, or the gate agent who is unable to report to the home office that the scheduling system is causing real problems for loyal customers.
In addition to eating away at the mollifier’s well-being, the work of the Chief Apology Officer is also ultimately doomed. By insulating the industrial system from the feedback loop that would improve it, these organizations doom themselves to a slow fade.
“Do you have any influence on how the organization is going to respond to this?” is a fair question. And the CAO can only honestly answer, “no.”

It won’t ship when it’s perfect.
It will ship because we said it would.
Once this is clear, the quality of what we ship goes way up. Instead of spending time and energy looking for reasons, excuses or deniability, we simply do the work.

If you buy a house for 15% over asking price, it doesn’t mean you overpaid.
The asking price is a signal, a way to message expectations and begin a negotiation. It’s simply a guess about the future, made by the person who goes first.

“Here we go again”,"Do you have a script? Most of us do.
Here’s a new piece of software. Do you immediately read the manual front to back? Dive in and see how it works? Tense up in fear and distaste?
She’s going to give you some feedback. Is your first reaction to be defensive, or to lean into the goodwill that’s being offered?
We’re going to fly somewhere for a meeting. Do you get stressed about all the preparations of showing up at the airport with everything you need? Are you filled with curiosity about how to spend the evening in a new city before we head back?
These scripts are everywhere. If the ones you have are working for you, you’ve discovered a reliable way to succeed and find satisfaction as you do.
But if they’re not, it might pay to spend the energy to approach the next cycle, ‘as if’.
The script might not be your fault. It might have taken a really long time to become ingrained. And it might be getting in the way.
What if you could leave the script behind, just this one time? It might take a lot of focus and effort, it might be incredibly difficult, but just once might be do-able.
The thing that gets us stuck isn’t us. It’s the script that we’ve decided is our only option.
Call it out. Realize that it’s not the only option. A script doesn’t always feel like a choice, but until we realize we’re running one, it’s unlikely we can do the hard work it takes to change it.

Personal velocity,"Why do bikes stay stable when you ride them (and fall down when you stop)?
A tiny reason is the gyroscopic stability of the wheels, but the real reason is the forward momentum of the rider. And we learn the first day we’re on the bike that forward motion is essential or we’re in trouble.
In our fast-moving world, it’s easy to get hooked on personal velocity. What’s in your inbox? Did someone follow you in the last ten seconds? Where’s the beep and the beep and the beep from your last post?
Perhaps we talk faster, interrupt, talk over, invent, dissect, criticize and then move on to the next thing. Boom, boom, boom.
Don’t want to fall off the bike.
But life isn’t a bike. It works fine if we take a moment and leave space for the person next to us to speak.
Are you going fast without getting anywhere?
We can get hooked on systems that want us to get hooked, on platforms that use our effort as their product, our emotions as fodder for their next milestone.
Doing something new simply because we’re worried that the old thing we were doing a minute ago isn’t fast enough is a waste. The crowd might enjoy it, but in the long run, it diminishes our contributions and our joy.
I could just as easily write about the person who is stuck, sitting in the back of the room, the corner of the Zoom, looking for deniability and a place to hide. That person with no velocity has ceased to contribute and might be in as much pain as the person who’s doing nothing but maintaining high personal velocity.

The control/responsibility matrix,"Alert readers of my last two posts have probably guessed what this one is about.
People make choices about their preferences for control and for taking responsibility. When we combine those choices, we end up with a simple matrix.
In the top right is an ideal combination. Someone with control and authority who also takes responsibility when things go wrong. This creates a useful feedback loop, because they can actually do something about the problems they caused.
In the bottom right is a disaster waiting to happen. This is brittle megalomaniac, Robert Moses, the builder, who spent nearly a century paving New York while neglecting housing and other social justice issues, but never took responsibility for any of the effects of his work. People who grab control and avoid responsibility are often easily identified because they spend a lot of time whining.
In the top left corner is someone who truly cares. They bring huge empathy to the situation, and they help people feel seen. Alas, because they don’t have power (either because it’s been denied to them or because they avoid it), their willingness to take responsibility is sort of hollow. This is one reason that frontline workers that are required to exert emotional labor and empathy on the job so often burn out.
And finally, in most situations, most people are in the bottom left. The system pushes us to be cogs, to accept what’s given in exchange for being let off the hook and not being held responsible for what happens next.
In many situations, we have the freedom to choose. We can choose a quadrant or we can choose not to participate. And if we’re lucky or care enough, we can choose who to vote for, who to work for and where we’re headed.","January 23, 2022","control, responsibility, choices"
Your responsibility preference,"When things go wrong, is your instinct to hide in a corner and hope you won’t get noticed–or to lean into the situation and make it clear that this one is on you?
“I’ve got this,” is a phrase that some people will go out of their way to avoid saying. At work, where it’s incredibly valuable, or in personal relationships, where it creates deep connection.
The movies are filled with heroes who take responsibility. Organizations are miserly when it comes to handing out authority, but most of them are eager to pay attention (and give respect) to anyone who is willing to take responsibility.
Like our control preference, responsibility is a learned skill. You might be born with an instinct for it, but mostly it’s something we’re taught or choose to learn.
Sadly, this is a line that’s missing from every resume I’ve ever seen. It seems to be that a bias toward taking responsibility is one of the most important things to look for when hiring an employee, finding a doctor or building a team.

Your control preference,"Would you rather write the script, read the script, watch the movie or write the review?
When someone commutes by train, they’re giving up control over the journey. On one hand, that means that they can’t actively impact how fast the train arrives. On the other hand, it means that they don’t have to be fully present and in command of all the decisions involved.
There’s a huge diversity of control preference, and it varies across the many areas of our lives. Perhaps you need to be in control over your work, but have no interest in controlling what you eat for dinner–or vice versa.
I remember a restaurant in the Bronx where the waiter would ask you one or two questions about which food you liked, and then walk away and bring you back a series of dishes that you didn’t expect or choose. Some people really enjoy this, others are frustrated by the lack of control it requires.
While it may be that each of us has an inherent bias away or toward control, it’s pretty clear that it is also a skill that can be learned, and that different industries allocate control to people as part of their hierarchies. It’s also true that different cultures have evolved to allocate and teach control preference in different ways. Sometimes it’s based on gender and caste, but there are also cultural mores that have been fueled by industry, the patriarchy and governance.
One of the things we certainly have control over is deciding whether we’ll seek to spend our days in control or not. We might have to make sacrifices along the way, but the feeling is up to us.

Of course, enrollment is frightening. Because enrollment confers responsibility. “This is something I’m choosing to do.”
Compulsory education doesn’t often lead to real learning. That’s because compulsory education is coerced. There’s no active enrollment.
For the rest of us, there’s the chance to engage and to move forward. And part of the journey is acknowledging that we have a dog, that life gets in the way, that it’s never the ideal moment or the perfect time. And then doing something about it.

Portfolio thinking,"When we’re not certain of the right answer, the best approach is to have a portfolio, a range of bets that reward us with resilience and significant upside.
An example can be something as simple as what to put on the buffet–if you’re not sure who’s coming to the meeting, it makes sense to have a variety of options, because the chances you’ll get it right go way up.
A more important example is in filling a job. If you only interview people from similar backgrounds and with similar skills, you’re eliminating a huge pool of talent that might in fact be a much better fit for the job.
The mistake we often make is in building a choice set (which we mistakenly call a ‘portfolio’) by trying again and again for one guaranteed ideal choice. That’s not a portfolio. Instead, we should focus on going to the edges, not trying to group everything at some imaginary ‘center’.
Back to the simple buffet example. If you have one spicy dish, one vegan dish, one dish without cilantro and one dish from a cuisine that’s out of the ordinary in this setting, your chances of “best lunch ever” are far higher than if you simply put out very slight variations of one theme.
When we can’t be sure of the future, a portfolio that acknowledges this by going to various edges will outperform one where we pretend we know the right answer.","January 14, 2022","Portfolio thinking, diversity, resilience"

And then they were hand-rolled into position. But that was too difficult.
So the electric window was born.

And the best programmers still code by hand, even though there are plenty of apps that would make it easier to create average user interactions.
The battle for most convenient is fierce. It might be easier to stake out your claim to interactions and products that are less convenient, but worth it.","January 13, 2022","convenience, countertrend, technology"
CB radio,"It was huge and kept growing by leaps and bounds.
Until it didn’t.
(My license was KFV2338, a number I haven’t said out loud in 40 years).
CB radio took off because human beings desperately want to connect with people they know and be heard by people they don’t.
And then it went away because it was noisy, unfiltered and sort of pointless.
We can’t imagine why people were so entranced.
Until the next one comes along.","January 12, 2022","CB radio, connection, obsolescence"
Flow (and progress),"A flow state is priceless. It happens when we lose ourselves in the work, simply connecting with the task, without commentary or doubt. When we’re in flow, time slows down, satisfaction rises and we feel fully engaged.
An easy way to end a flow state is to see how well you’re doing. Are you ahead of the other runners? Are you progressing according to the milestones? Do you have more social metrics now?
The irony, of course, is that the best way to make progress is to find flow. But if you’re using progress as a yardstick, it won’t last long.","January 11, 2022","Flow state, progress, engagement"
Dancing with status roles,"First, we have to see them.
Some people, no matter how fast or slow their friends are walking, always walk a step behind.
Or perhaps you need to live in the nicest house on the block, or drive the fanciest car.
There are people who can’t rest until they know that they’re at the top of their class, or use up their available credit limit, whatever the limit is.
Maybe you need to finish everything on your plate, plus your friend’s. Or maybe you always leave something over.
The thing is that status roles are always local. We compare ourselves to the others in our circle, not everyone on the planet.
If your status narrative isn’t making you happy, you can try to change it–but it’s truly difficult to do so. The get-along person rarely shifts gears and becomes the dominating competitor, or vice versa.
An alternative is to do the hard work (but in a brief window) of choosing your circle and setting your limits.
If you need to live in the biggest, fanciest house, choose a neighborhood where doing that won’t break everything else in your personal life. If you overtrain to be sure you’re going to win, enter races where the overtraining won’t wipe you out.
If you need to avoid the front of the parade, don’t pick an industry or a cultural setting where only the people at the front are treated well.
We choose our boundaries rarely, but we have to live with them every day.","January 10, 2022","status roles, personal boundaries, comparison"
Speed limits,"The school zone has a speed limit of 15 miles per hour. It’s hard to be opposed to this sort of restriction, because the consequences are so dire and the cost is so low.
The driver is making a choice, the kids, not so much. The driver is surrounded by steel and safety devices, the kids, not so much.
Living in community is about limits. That’s a foundational feature that permits it to work. They’re all around us, and we only notice them when they change.","January 9, 2022","speed limits, school zone, community safety"
Coming soon,"The phone is ringing. Your ice cream is melting. Next month’s rent is due. There’s a useful workshop coming up in a few months. Your hard drive will fail before the end of the year. College tuition will need to start being paid in five years. Your back tooth is going to need a crown in 2030. New York City is going to be underwater in 2050.
When is soon?
Every one of these things is something we can choose to pay attention to right now. Each one is either urgent or important, it’s up to us. Paying attention to something when the problem is still small makes it far less of an issue later.
The ringer on a phone was designed to establish urgency. And social media has optimized for that itch as well.
But it’s not up to them.
[For your calendars, two updates:

Progress,"Technology is not neutral. It can’t be, because by definition, advances in tech create change, and change always creates positives and negatives.
We now live in a time of rapid technological change, perhaps the biggest in 150 years. In the face of the overwhelming impact of tech, we might not be enjoying the ride.
Sometimes the problem is the tech itself, and sometimes it’s about our fear of change and unknown.
It’s worth taking a moment to think about which technology we’d rather live without–in other words, when was the golden age that we’re nostalgic for, the one that technology has tarnished in the name of progress?
They’re not in a perfect order, but if you had to draw the line, where and when would you put it?

Shipping creative work,"This is not the same as being creative.
In fact, they’re very different skills and emotional mindsets.
All humans are creative. Sometimes.
Creativity is a special sort of internal conversation, an opportunity to see a problem or a situation and then produce something that dances with it.
But shipping creative work is a cultural and professional risk.
One way to confirm this is to see how different something feels when it’s truly anonymous. If it doesn’t matter to you whether the work resonates with someone else, if there’s no way to tell and no feedback of any kind, then it’s far less fraught.
Realizing that there are two things at work here–the willingness to lean into problem solving AND the willingness to share it–it’s possible to focus on the part that’s holding you back.","January 6, 2022","Creativity, Shipping, Risk"
Laser noise,"Laser guns don’t make noise. At least in real life. In the movies, they always do. Phasers and ray guns and light sabers all manage to make distinctive sounds.
And we don’t mind. In fact, we expect them to.
The foley artist works overtime to create sounds that amplify our experience and fill in the gaps–because the experience is the point.
Does your project have a foley artist? Because it certainly has gaps.","January 5, 2022","laser noise, foley artist, sound effects"
Defensive/offensive/actual,"The problem with becoming defensive is that our internal narrative gets in the way of expressing what’s actually going on. Because we’re imagining all the blame and shame and scorn that the other person may or may not be feeling toward us, we bring those feelings into our words and actions, and end up making a mess.
And the problem with being offensive is that the person we’re offending can no longer hear what we’re saying.
Communication lives between the two. We do best when we can describe the actual, the same way we might talk about the weather. Here is what is. Simply that.","January 4, 2022","communication, defensiveness, authenticity"
Generative hobbies,"Some people say “hobby” like it’s a bad thing. In a race for more, it seems as though doing something you don’t get paid for, something that requires patience and skill–well, some people don’t get it. They’d rather troll around on social media or watch a rerun.
A generation or two ago, hobbies were things like paint by number or candlemaking, or perhaps a woodshop. That’s changing. Not simply because computers allow us to be far more professional, but because the very nature of the output is different.
This might be the golden age for a new kind of hobby, one that’s about community, leadership and producing public goods, not private ones.
Because it’s so much easier to connect and because ideas multiply, the generative hobby gives us a chance to make a contribution, even (especially) when we’re not at work. Sharing ideas, leading, connecting…
Wikipedia is the result of 5,000 people working together to produce a resource that’s used by a billion people. The people who have contributed the most don’t workthere, they work on it.
Jeff Atwood is transforming a long-lost and influentialbookinto a modern tool for a new generation. Github is a professional tool, but it’s also become a clearinghouse for projects that simply exist to make things better.
It’s magical when it works. I’ve spent the last three months working with a cadre of people on a community project, and it’s been a highlight of my career.
Perhaps “generative contribution” is a better name for it. But I’m all for reclaiming “hobby,” because the way we spend our time is the way we spend our lives.","January 3, 2022","Generative hobbies, community, contribution"
Time doesn’t scale,"That’s why it’s worth so much.
Sure, you can outsource. You can look for shortcuts. You can hire folks. You can use mailmerge. You can even send it to voice mail.
But all of these time shortcuts fail to express the thing we want the most.
Your time, my time, their time–we all get the same number of minutes per day.
If you spend them on someone, they can tell.","January 2, 2022","Time, Value, Relationships"
Might as well quit,"There’s a better cause right around the corner. It might not work. You’ll never be able to keep all the promises. It can’t last forever. We’re all going to die. It’s not perfect. Someone might steal your idea. There will be critics. You’re not ready. Someone else is going to do it. It’s not that important. It might not work.

One sigh per yes,"When a client, a boss or an employee makes a special request, it’s okay to get a little bent out of shape. It might cost you extra time or money, it might be a hassle, it might not be deserved.
And then you can say no.
But if you say yes, then it pays to be in it. 100%.

"Chaos, connection and industrial systems","Industrial systems thrive on predictability. It smooths out the supply chain, improves efficiency and makes many of the participants more comfortable.
Tomorrow is like yesterday, but perhaps a little faster or cheaper.
But breakthroughs, creativity and human connection don’t come from predictability. They come from unpredictable interactions with unknown ideas and voices.
Just about all bestsellers are surprise bestsellers. All big ideas come out of left field. But if you spend your time looking at left field, they’ll come out of right field instead.
Chaos is uncomfortable, particularly if you’ve been indoctrinated in the industrial mindset. But if the right people and the right conditions are present, chaos creates possibility.

Common pitfalls and myths of the new economy,"It’s not high school.
But some of the advice that people are embracing reminds us of those days… Things that everyone tells you that aren’t true:
It’s possible to get rich quickly without taking risks(not really)
Just because someone bought some crazy dog currency or NFT and got lucky doesn’t mean that you will. It’s remarkable when someone beats the odds because, by definition, the odds are always hard to beat.
Every social media platform has stars and if you follow the path, you will become one(not most people)
There are more media stars now than ever before in history. But the nature of the power-law curve is clear: in order for a star to be valuable, most people can’t be one. Doing what the last star did is not likely to get you what the last star got.
The best way to build a following online is to be fully authentic(oof)
Keanu is not Neo. He’s an actor. Youssou N’Dour doesn’t go on stage when he feels like it, he goes on stage when it’s showtime. The world will never knowyou, but they will judge you.  Or at least the you that is presented when you go online.
The hardest part of online commerce is building your website(well, no.)
Actually, it’s simply the part you do before you go live. It’s the clothes you wear, not the way you actually engage with the world. The hard part is finding an audience and earning the benefit of the doubt. The hard part is creating community, leading and building something people want.
Freelancing is like having a job without a boss(alas)
Well, you still have a boss. It’s you. And you might not be a good one. Freelancers spend part of their day doing the work, and the rest of the time earning better clients.
The hard part of the work is doing the work.","February 25, 2022","economy, myths, freelancing"
Be careful what you wish for,"You might not get it.
But as you pursue this wish, you’ll change what you do, what you see, who you connect with and the sacrifices you make along the way.
Our wishes change us.","February 24, 2022","wishes, transformation, sacrifice"
A little more or a little less,"The producer of a successful product has a choice to make.
If you put a little less in the box, people will run out sooner and have to buy more.
If you give people a little more for their money, they’ll purchase less often, but become more loyal.
It turns out that in most markets where there are easy substitutions, the long-term value of loyalty is far greater than the short-term profit of less.","February 23, 2022","loyalty, marketing strategy, consumer behavior"
A second opinion,"A friend is selling his house. Apparently, real estate brokers now have a way of reporting the comments (reviews) from potential buyers at open houses, and he was crazy enough to read them.
Of course, this is incredibly unhelpful. He can’t rebuild his house to sell it. Hearing that people don’t like his custom cabinets or the layout of the living room isn’t actionable–especially since the other half of the comments contradict the first half.
What’s actually happening is that someone who isn’t qualified or emotionally connected enough to make a purchase is looking for something to say. And humans are really bad at explaining our irrational feelings in the context of rational reasons. So we make stuff up.
And we’re equally bad at hearing comments about things we can’t change.
By all means, ask a second doctor before you get surgery. But in just about every public setting, the comments aren’t going to be particularly helpful.","February 22, 2022","second opinion, real estate, buyer feedback"
Sales and the story of money,"“Twenty-four ninety-five.”
I was on the phone hearing a pitch for a service I needed. I had reached out to a recommended vendor, and was now sitting through a pitch from a salesperson who had a script but no listening skills.
I had figured that the service was probably $300 if I shopped around, but I was willing to pay a bit more than that if it would save time.
Finally, the script-reader got to the price.
“It’s 24.95.”
I paused for a second. “You mean it’s twenty four dollars and ninety-five cents?”
“No,” he said.
“Oh… you meant to say two-thousand-four-hundred-and-ninety-five dollars…”
Why would you write the script to anchor the price at 1% of what it really costs?
Instead of a fruitless hustle, two other stories could have worked better.
A competent salesperson could have said, “Some of our competitors charge $300 and some charge $5,000. We’re right in the middle and I can tell you why.”
Or perhaps they could have said, “Some people charge as little as $300 for this. Let me tell you why we charge a lot more than that, and why it might be a smart choice for you.”
In both cases, the truth becomes a firm foundation for a story about value and position.
Money is a story we tell ourselves about value, status and position.","February 21, 2022","Sales, pricing, value"
Begrudgingly,"Social niceties are easy to do half-heartedly.
But they’re not for us, they’re for the other person.
When you show up begrudgingly, it’s not half-hearted, it’s cold hearted.
A handshake, a greeting, the way we sit in a meeting or wear a mask–it’s a chance to connect and to make a difference for the person we’re with.
All in, or not at all.","February 20, 2022","social niceties, connection, engagement"
Who chooses?,"When Google or Facebook or Spotify decide what you’ll see next, they’re making a choice.
That’s very different from an open platform like “podcasting” or “blogging” (in quotes with no capital letters, because no one is in charge.)
Being in charge implies that choices are being made. And people who are in charge–even if it’s just one person in charge of their own voice–are choosing.
Choosing is a form of selection, of amplification and of curation. Not official government censorship, but something more nuanced than that, the responsibility that comes from choice.
In many parts of our culture, particularly pockets of tech, it’s fashionable to talk about ‘free speech’ and ‘open platforms’ as if they’re unalloyed virtues. But the moment Apple puts a podcast on its home page,  Google decides to put this blog in your promo folder, or Spotify decides to promote one song or podcast over another, the platform is no longer truly open. Often, individuals and organizations use terms like this when they’re defending something that isn’t helpful to the people who encountered it.
When money enters the picture, it’s even more complicated. There’s a difference between a truly open platform and an algorithm staffed by people who put one sort of website on their spam list and another highly ranked, simply because they make more of a profit on the second one. Or when YouTube or Spotify pay people a thousand (or two hundred million) dollars to host their content…
Ideas shared create value. Good ideas are the engine of our future. We’ve seen that when creators of ideas take responsibility for their work, it’s more likely that we all benefit.
Wide-open platforms almost always lead to chaos, negative side effects and anonymous spam. I’m in favor of choice, especially when it’s made by organizations and individuals willing to be held responsible for the choices they make.","February 19, 2022","platforms, choice, responsibility"
"The Oxford comma, trap","It’s easy to accept the limits that are implied when someone asks us for advice and feedback.
Fix the typos, sure. That’s important. But perhaps you have something bigger to add.
A friend shares plans to launch a new retail website. It’s tempting to fix the small errors on the page, but perhaps it’s more useful to discuss the product line, the pricing or whether or not it should be online at all…
The author shares a draft of a new work. You could help with the grammar, but maybe it would help more if you talked about the parts that weren’t included.

Don’t guard your luck,"Maybe we don’t want to talk about it. Perhaps we believe that unexamined luck isn’t quite as fragile.
Perhaps we don’t want to let anyone else in. It could be that we think that success is scarce, and scarcity will somehow preserve it.
Or maybe we want to insist that it’s all due to skill and nothing but skill. Even though we know that this isn’t true.","February 16, 2022","luck, success, scarcity"
Open field running,"Here’s what’s easy to find:
Multiple choice plus effort plus persistence.
We’ve been trained since birth to look for small, do-able tasks with boundaries. It seems as though our effort is better spent there, the risk and responsibility are a lot smaller.
“Don’t ask me what’s next, tell me what’s next!”
As a result, we often default to others when it comes to figuring out the boundaries and ignore the opportunities that are right in front of us.
The alternative is to draw the map instead of reading it.
Because the willingness to do this is scarce, it’s often valued quite highly. And we can learn to do it better if we practice.","February 15, 2022","Open field running, persistence, personal boundaries"
Invent a new holiday,"It doesn’t have to last all day–it could be for an hour or even a month.
How would you celebrate it? Who else needs to be part of it?
It’s a symbol, a marker, a chance for conversation. It can amplify culture, give you a chance to have a conversation and allow you and the people around you to focus on something for a short while.

The thing about a gold rush,"It’s not the “gold.”
It’s the “rush” that changes the way people behave.
When consumed by a gold rush, people make decisions that they would never make on ordinary days. They trust entities, make assumptions and suspend disbelief. Not because there’s gold on the line, but because everyone else is rushing, and the fear of missing out is significant.
Rushing can help us overcome the status quo and our fear of the unknown. It can also lead to choices that hurt us in the long run.
We should rush on purpose. It’s a choice.","February 13, 2022","gold rush, decision making, fear of missing out"
“We don’t care” (you won’t let us),"The customer service from the freight shipping company that came to my home a few months ago was truly terrible. Not simply a lack of care, but an aggressive embrace of uncaring. Every interaction was offputting and inefficient.
This is the result of sort by price.
It turns out that a lot of freight shipping is done through an intermediary. Software automatically scans all available options and picks the cheapest one.
Which means that brands don’t matter, customer feedback doesn’t matter and reviews don’t matter. Neither does corporate responsibility or employee satisfaction.
All that matters is the price the shipper pays and ultimately the price of the stock.
Sort by price insulates the producer from the customer. When we resort to a single metric, we get what we measure, and the side effects pile up.
More and more, the choices are, “You’ll get a discount and you will get less than you paid for” and /or “you’ll pay a bit more and you’ll get more than you paid for.”","February 12, 2022","freight shipping, customer service, price comparison"
“We were wrong”,"Groups rarely say this.
They often (and loudly) state “we are right,” but when the future arrives, and it always does, it’s not surprising that it turns out that many projections and predictions turned out to be wrong.
When smoking was banned in New York restaurants and bars, the trade associations vehemently protested, insisting that it would doom their businesses. It turned out to be a benefit instead.
All we can hope for is for an individual to say, “based on new information, I’ve made a new decision.”
While it might be satisfying for a group to publicly acknowledge what they’ve learned, waiting for this is a waste of time and energy. The alternative is to help a person make a new decision instead.","February 11, 2022","acknowledgment, decision-making, change"
Marked cards,"It’s almost impossible to tell if a playing card is marked.
But if you take ten cards and riffle them, you can tell instantly. The changes from the back of one card to another jump out at you.
It’s difficult to tell where we are if we only have a few data points–sooner or later, anywhere feels normal.
The key question is, “compared to what?”
On the other hand, if all you’ve got is all you’ve got, comparing it to something else might only create regret.","February 10, 2022","marked cards, data points, comparison"
It’s easy to do (if you know how to do it),"This is the dilemma that every game designer, form creator and teacher faces.
Writing an instruction manual, doing a survey, creating a map–they’re all difficult tasks because of the translation that’s required: the person doing the work already knows what they’re trying to teach. But the person interacting with the manual doesn’t.
The empathy required here overwhelms many people, regardless of how well-meaning they might be.
After all, the person you’re instructing doesn’t know what you know (yet). They might not learn the way you learn. And you might have come to your knowledge via a different path.
The three elements of successful instructional design might be:
Acknowledge that communicating what you know is difficult.
Find empathy for people who don’t know what you know yet.
Test the work, often.

Limitless,"Infinity is a great idea, but unless you’re doing math, it’s mostly an idea.
Everything else in our world has limits. It’s the limits that make it interesting, the limits that give us an edge to the box, something to leverage against.
Instead of denying the existence of limits and the trade-offs that they bring with them, it might be helpful to begin with an understanding of what they are, or at least what other people think they are.","February 8, 2022","Limits, Understanding, Trade-offs"
The stale green light,"Coming down the empty road, you can see the light from a ways off. It’s been green for awhile, which means it’s due to turn red soon.
Should you speed up, so you can make it through before the yellow appears and is gone…
Or should you slow down, so you can safely and gracefully come to a complete stop?
It depends.
If it’s an actual green light, you should certainly slow down. It’s safer. It won’t take that much time. You have the engine of the car to do the work.
But if it’s a metaphorical green light, a window of opportunity, a shift in the culture you can feel disappearing, it might very well pay to speed up. Because that extra effort, done with safety on behalf of those you seek to serve, will compound.

Of course, spiders, dogs and walruses prefer if the world doesn’t change. But humans are different. Change is fuel for growth and possibility.

The trough of inefficiency,"Successful organizations of just one or two freelancers have very high revenue per employee, effective labor utilization and few communications problems.
And significant organizations of a hundred or a thousand people also produce enormous amounts of revenue, profit and perhaps value.
In between, though, there’s a slog.
That’s because a successful tiny organization that adds people creates communication problems. Instead of each person knowing what to do, they need to meet about it. They also require people to support their people–HR, policies, etc.
The trough is characterized by nascent specialization, and if any specialist can’t deliver, the entire entity struggles, because there’s just one specialist for each category. Many mouths to feed, but fewer farmers per capita.
In that trough, many small businesses flounder.
They had the profit or the investment to grow, but they grew too much or didn’t grow enough. Either way, they’re caught in the trough.
The trick is to understand your industry well enough to know where the trough lies.","February 2, 2022","inefficiency, communication problems, specialization"
In temporary residence,"They will outlast you.
Why are some industries so irrational (when seen from the point of view of the customer)?
So many things about college, funerals, real estate, hotels, weddings and the contractor trade are frustrating and opaque to customers. It almost seems as though they’re organized with a long-term, industry-wide focus away from customer satisfaction.
No one chooses to regularly have a party as expensive, isolating or stressful as a wedding is. We don’t view the pricing or activities of a funeral as natural or affirming. If someone tried to build an institution like college today, there’s no way it would be structured the way it is now. If you think about the rituals of most of these industries, they don’t make sense.
That’s because customers come and customers go. Sometimes quite literally, but always.
As a result, the customer is often a first-timer, in need of indoctrination. And the customer has far less power, because they won’t be back again any time soon.
In some ways, the connecting power of the internet reinforces this imbalance, allowing industry forces to coordinate and coalesce. But in other ways, each of these industries is open to radical shift because customers can get smarter and coordinate on their part as well.","February 1, 2022","customer experience, industry dissatisfaction, irrationality"
The physical therapy metaphor,"For many ailments, physical therapy shows some of the best results. We can learn a lot from this for our own projects, organizations and narratives. Physical therapy often works better than pills or surgery. Here’s why:
–it’s self-produced. Even though we work with a professional, it’s done BY us, not TO us.
–it’s gradual. No one gets better after one session.
–it puts our own resources to work to create the change we seek.
–it’s simple. There’s no magic involved, just directed, persistent effort based on science and testing.
–it takes effort. If you want something easy, you’re in the wrong place.

Testing new ideas,"What would a focus group have said about the title of Harper Lee’sTo Kill a Mockingbird?Is it easy to understand, did you know what it’s about before you pick up the book?
What about the consumer testing on a name like Nike or Starbucks?
Some objective measures of new names and concepts are worth knowing about before you launch. Seeing what search results look like, understanding the trademark register, having insight about pronunciation and language issues.
But general “how does this make you feel” feedback on a new concept is almost certain to give you exactly the wrong feedback.
That’s because the idea isn’t going to work because it’s objectively, obviously and completely better. It’s going to work because the network effects and cultural dynamics behind it push it forward.","March 30, 2022","focus group, testing, consumer feedback"
The hospitality systems gap,"What’s the variance in customer service at your organization?
Even if there’s just one employee, the question is: If an issue is handled by a committed employee having a good attitude, vs a cranky one who is a bit off–can the customer tell?
One philosophy is to make this gap as small as possible. Create systems that ensure that the experience remains the same, always pretty good. Make sure your scripts and your policies and your phone tree and your management oversight is such that there isn’t much of a gap.
The other philosophy is to hire great people and give them room to shine. With all the variability that entails.
It’s almost impossible to have both.
If you want to create remarkable service, you’re simply going to have to trust your people and yourself.
Heroes use systems, they aren’t held back by them.","March 29, 2022","hospitality, customer service, employee variability"
Re-calibrating,"When an entrepreneur gets funded, it’s often difficult for them to start spending money on assets–the old limits fade slowly. What used to be smart is now dumb. What used to too risky is now the safe thing to do.
When someone gets older or is injured, one of the dangers is that they’ll fail to realize that they can’t do the things they used to do in quite the same way.
And graduating from college means that you probably can’t maintain the lifestyle you used to have…

Speeding up for the red light,"Bad drivers do this often, everywhere I’ve ever been in the world.
Instead of gracefully and safely slowing for a light they know will be red by the time they get there, or even a stop sign, they hit the gas and then slam the brakes.
One big reason is that the certainty of on-then-off is a lot easier for them to navigate than a thoughtful approach to transitions. If you’re going to have to stop soon, perhaps you should start coasting now.
And of course, we all make the braking mistake in our daily lives.

Expertise vs Attitude,"The typical online job site lists millions of jobs. And just about every one of them is a cry for expertise.
From the title to the requirements, companies hire for expertise.
Logic helps us understand that only one out of ten people are in the top 10% when it comes to expertise. And that means that most companies are settling for good enough. If the organization needs people with expertise in the top decile, they’re going to have to pay far more and work far harder to find and retain that sort of skill.
So most companies don’t try. They create jobs that can be done pretty well by people with a typical amount of expertise.
That means that the actual differentiator in just about every job is attitude. From plumbers to carpenters to radiologists to pharmacists, someone with extraordinary soft skills (honesty, commitment, compassion, resilience, enrollment in the journey, empathy, willingness to be coached… the real skills that we actually care about) is going to outperform.
If this is so obviously true, then why don’t organizations hire for attitude and train for expertise?","March 26, 2022","expertise, attitude, hiring"
Where do symbols live?,"If the original Nike swoosh, on a sheet of paper in a filing cabinet somewhere, disappeared, what would happen to the value of Nike? Or to the way you feel about your sneakers?
If the negative of a famous photo is burned in a fire, or a painting is stolen from a museum, what happens to the symbol it’s related to?
As soon as an object becomes a symbol, the object itself becomes separate from that story. In fact, freeing the symbol from the object gives it more power, and allows it to spread and become ever more relevant.
My town is trying to decide whether or not it should spend millions of dollars preserving a defunct carbon-steel water tower. But whether they preserve it or not, the symbol of the tower remains, and the stories we tell ourselves about place and time remain as well.
Spending the money on education, climate remediation and equity will all make the symbol more powerful than steel restoration ever could.
If you want to turn your object into a more powerful symbol, it might pay to get rid of the object.","March 25, 2022","symbols, value, preservation"
The power of TK,"The origin of the editor’s mark “TK” is murky. It’s what you write when there’s a fact or addition you’re waiting on. Instead of stopping everything, simply type “TK” and you know you can come back and fix it later.
The modern purpose of TK is that there are few words in English that contain these two letters juxtaposed in this way, so it’s super easy to use Word to search your manuscript. (Except for ‘latkes’ and ‘pocketknife.’) But I think it predates search.
The magic of TK is more interesting. The existence of TK means we don’t have to stop and wait for everything to be perfect before we proceed.
If the flooring for the kitchen hasn’t arrived yet, TK and then move on to wallpaper the dining room.

The cake mix insight,"When Betty Crocker (not her real name) first started selling cake mixes, all you had to do was add water. They failed.
But when they changed the recipe and required users to add oil and an egg, sales went up.
Because people like to feel as though they’re cooking. It made the mix an activity that felt like home making.
If you order a high-end table saw (and you should, so you don’t get injured) you might discover that there are a fair number of nuts and bolts to install. For the premium that’s charged, there’s no reason for this–except that assembling the last bit yourself feels worthy.

The lurkers,"It’s frustrating for anyone who leads.
If everyone who says that they’re a contributor/member/supporter/fan/long-term customer showed up, huge things would happen.
So we spend a lot of time hustling to get the lurkers to take action. Post again! Create more incentives! Dumb it down! Most of all, focus on creating urgency.
This isn’t how progress actually happens.
The 95% who lurk will almost always lurk. That’s okay.
The place to focus is on the 5%. Because when their persistent, consistent and generous action begins to add up, change happens. And that brings the lurkers along. It might even activate them. They’ll catch up when they need to.
There’s nothing wrong with lurkers. Lurkers are potential action-takers.

Peak customer service and the hospitality mindset,"Is cheaper better?
Is profit the only thing to be maximized?
For its first decade, Federal Express embraced customer service as a marketing tool. They were competing with the postal service, but more than that, they were trying hard to create a habit that turned 25 cent deliveries into $20 deliveries, particularly among businesses.
They answered the phone on the first ring.
They hired people who cared about the customer experience and gave them tools to keep their promises.
They sacrificed short-term profits in order to build a brand promise that people could trust.
Some organizations end up ingraining this ethos deeply into what they do, and stick with it for the long haul. They have a hospitality mindset. Service isn’t simply the tool to make profits–it’s a key part of why you’re here in the first place.
In the last decade, Fedex (simply to pick a familiar example, they’re by no means unique) decided to take a different path.
They don’t answer the phone easily. When they do, they box their low-paid workers in with scripts and policies that leave little room for human engagement. They remove less profitable dropboxes, and shorten the hours they do pickups. When a package goes awry, they do little to repair the broken trust it creates.  I’m sure a McKinsey consultant ran the numbers on all of these changes.
All of these steps add up to slightly more profit in the short run. And, perhaps, over time, people who really care (the difficult customers?) switch to another provider. But the real cost here is to their people, their mission and the culture they seek to build.
Hospitality is a choice, not simply a tactic.
It’s possible to build an organization that does work you’re proud of, surrounded by people who feel the same way. People who care, solving problems and creating connection.","March 21, 2022","Customer Service, Hospitality Mindset, Brand Trust"
The things you can’t see,"Do you remember all the elements you didn’t used to notice?
It might be the way you see typography now, or the tuning of an orchestra. Or the alignment in the mouldings of a house you’re inspecting or the way an engine sounds… (or whether you put a ‘u’ in moulding)
Expertise is about learning new ways to notice.
Often, once we learn to see, we assume we’ve always known. And that allows us to believe that the things we can’t see, we’ll never be able to see.
But it doesn’t work that way unless we get complacent.

Question authority,"Lock-in persists. That’s why it’s so valued by monopolists, tyrants and cults.
The ability to speak up always creates inefficiency. It’s easier to just shut up and drive. Or be driven.
But the ability to speak up is a self-cleaning algorithm. Our freedom to move on, to criticize and to suggest creates the conditions for the system to improve.
It’s tempting to sign up for the one with lock-in. It often comes with bonuses, inducements and the promises of efficiency and dominance.
But it’s not resilient. When the world changes, and it always does, open systems are far less brittle than their shiny counterparts.","March 19, 2022","Authority, Lock-in, Open Systems"
Inside the bubble,"Whenever there’s a speculative bubble going on (or a cultural one, for that matter) life inside the bubble seems rational and normal.
And so artists at Miami:Basel are talking about minting NFTs. Not because they understand them (they don’t) or because they provide actual utility (they don’t) but because that’s what life is like inside of this particular speculative bubble.
And people outside the bubble are supposed to feel left behind, because that’s part of the fuel of life inside the bubble.
When a corporate culture begins to get insular, or a community starts acting like a cult, the same thing happens.
Culture is “the way we do things around here.” The very nature of a bubble is that there’s an inside and an outside, an expanding reality-distortion field that assures people inside the bubble that they’re doing things that are rational and normal.
If you’re confident that the bubble is here for the long-term, perhaps we shouldn’t hesitate to play along.
But when the bubble bursts (and speculative bubbles always do), be prepared for reality to disagree with your assertions.

The hobgoblin of fidelity,"My first computer game design was in 1977–I came up with a version of Star Wars. It was almost nothing like the movie, but it was a pretty good game for something running on a mainframe.
The Godfather isn’t a perfect retelling of the book.  But it’s a better movie as a result.
A really good recording doesn’t sound like a live concert or what you’d hear sitting in the studio. It sounds like a really good record. And when Alan Dean Foster and I turned Shadowkeep from a computer game into a novel, the goal wasn’t to replicate a computer game, it was to create a good novel.
When a medium arrives, or time shifts, it’s sometimes tempting to aim for a complete reconstruction of what came before. Follow the rules, don’t innovate. But that’s a mistake–a safe choice that’s actually a trap.
People desire media that is in and of itself. Each form of media has its own character, and fidelity from one form to another is a compromise that rarely works.
Because the world has changed, original isn’t original anymore. It can’t be, even if we want it to, because now it’s out of place. Just as we can’t step in the same river twice, each innovation in media forces us to walk away from fidelity to honor what’s possible.
Fidelity might feel like an option, and it takes effort and care. But is fidelity the best you can do?
When we switch media, or time zones, or cultures, or technology, it’s up to us to make the idea what it can become, not simply an unpalatable simulacrum of what it was over there.","March 16, 2022","fidelity, media, innovation"
All the best,"Benchmarking involves looking at every element of what you offer and comparing it to the very best element of any of your competitors.
So your door handle is as good as the Audi’s, and your brake pedal is as good as the Volvo’s and…
It’s pretty tempting to do this. Who wants any element of what they do to be inferior to a competitor’s?
And yet…
That’s almost never what makes something remarkable (it’s worth noting that the Ford Taurus was the car that brought benchmarking to my attention… who wants a Ford Taurus?).
What makes something remarkable is a combination of its internal synergy—the parts work together as a coherent whole—and its imbalance. Something about it is worth talking about. Something about it is hard to find. Something about it helps us achieve our goals if we talk about it.

Start with someone else’s work,"A simple approach to learning how to solicit and receive feedback: Begin by showing a well-meaning peer someone else’s novel, painting, design or business plan…
You might discover that when you show it to a friend (“here’s a chapter from a novel I’m writing” or “Here’s the logo my firm is considering”) you get harsh, direct criticism, filled with certainty and warning.
It’s easier to hear, because it’s not your work. They’re busy criticizing a chapter that JK Rowling wrote, or a logo that the late Milton Glaser created.
“Oh,” you’ll realize, “this isn’t about the work, it’s about me, it’s about someone trying to help me avoid heartache later.”
It turns out that most people are unpracticed and unprofessional at giving useful feedback. Learning to differentiate well-meaning fear-on-your-behalf from actually useful insight is a great first step in understanding who to ask when it really matters.

Three problems of healthcare,"Technology/science
Resources
Information
For a long time, we had no clue. We didn’t know about germs or viruses. We thought that ulcers were caused by pastrami sandwiches. We went to the barber for bloodletting and didn’t understand genes or evolution.
Technology in medicine, the science of understanding and intervening, has made huge leaps. There are more to come, but most of what ails us is very well understood.
As we’ve developed more of an understanding of technology, we’ve also dramatically increased the number of resources we put into healthcare. Particularly in parts of the privileged world, but also worldwide, we spend more on clean water, pharmaceuticals, surgery etc. than we ever did before.
The real problem of healthcare in this moment isinformation. We hamstring well-meaning healthcare professionals, burdening them with forms and scans and processes simply because their institutions don’t have a better way to collect and share information. We suffer from cranks, trolls and charlatans because we don’t have a systemic, trusted way to share what we already know about how our health works. And all of us make damaging lifestyle choices that erode the world’s health far more than any disease.
Information about technology and resources is the key to using the tools we already have. Who needs help, when they  need help and what help they need–we’re doing a lousy job of this.
In one sense, the information problem is good news. Because we keep getting better at information. In two decades, we went from a visit to the library to Google. We have access to more science, more location and historical data and more behavior insight in the last few years than in all of recorded history before that.
Humans are always going to be fearful and superstitious when it comes to our health. We’ll probably continue to fall into bad habits and make panicked choices.

The million-dollar gap,"To make an album of music good enough to make it to the Top 40, it used to cost a million dollars. Now you can do it in your bedroom.
To make a commercial for network TV, a minute of footage cost about a million dollars…
And that same million was what it would cost to create an email engine for permission-based marketing in 1996.
And you needed a million dollars to build a website that could hold up under a lot of traffic, or to build a social media presence that would reach a million people.
All of these things are now incredibly cheap.
A veteran marketer’s first reaction is relief at how inexpensive so many tools now are.
But the reality is that the reduction in cost means that price is not a barrier, and when it comes to producing your message, your movie, your song, your site, your book–everyone else is now doing it as well.
And yet, more than a decade into this dramatic compression of the gap, big-time marketers and industry players are still acting as if the gap is still there, as if their ‘professional’ creations are only competing with each other for attention.

When a salesperson fails to open the door for the leap, the customer is ill-served. The status quo is powerful and left to our own devices, many of us would fail to go where we hope to.
On the other hand, when the marketing and sales folks push too hard, trust is broken. People end up being manipulated into actions that they’d rather not have taken, and relationships fall apart.

If you can’t find a win-win, it might be time to find a win-lose where the most people with something at stake end up benefitting. Often, that means that entrenched interests and those that have traditionally come first don’t do as well in the short run.","April 24, 2022","win-win fallacy, leadership, win-lose solution"
“Because it’s more convenient”,"This is a terrible reason to do something that makes things a little worse for other people.
And a common one, of course.
Much of the time, we’re willing to go out of our way to do work we’re proud of. Unless it would be inconvenient to do so.
One of the reasons our best work is important is that it’s also inconvenient.
Alas, convenience beats just about everything.
[But then, as some people who actually care do inconvenient things, those things become normal, which, amazingly, makes them more convenient for everyone else.]","April 23, 2022","convenience, effort, community"
The traffic metaphors,"Your mileage may vary.
Speeding up to get to a red light faster just wastes energy.
Honking doesn’t make traffic go away.
Doesn’t matter how fancy your car is, it’s not worth very much if they close the road.
One of the worst ways to get to where you’re going is to always drive in the fastest moving lane and avoid any toll roads. The flow of traffic isn’t always going where you want to go.
Following another car will eventually get you lost.
If you don’t stop to refuel, you’re going to get stranded.
Giving someone a chance, or the right of way, and letting them into traffic doesn’t really slow you down that much.
In our culture, we give way too many resources to cars and their efficiency and not enough to pedestrians and the opportunities that they deserve.
The map is not the territory, but a map is a good thing to have.

Words that matter,"Any word that’s really important is also confusing. Words like trust, love, friend, fair, honest, lead, connect, authentic, justice, dignity–they have dozens of different meanings.

Defender of the brand,"Some CMOs and marketing types simply do ads and promo. Give them average products for average people and some money, and they’ll do the ad thing.
And some are actually marketers. Marketing involves making a promise and keeping it. Marketers understand that your logo isn’t a brand, it’s simply a flag. The brand is the experience that people expect to have when they engage with you. It’s your benefit of the doubt.
If you’re that kind of marketer, you quickly come to learn that the single most important part of your job is being sure that you make great products and services. Because sooner or later, the experience is the brand. Sooner or later, the story you tell needs to be true.
Which means…
That your main job is persuading the people you work with to ship great stuff. No junk. No shortcuts.

Perhaps egging on the other person will help them explore the edges.

Asking and daring,"High Noon is a cornerstone of American cinema, a sobering and memorable look at heroism and community.
In the movie, the sheriff is facing near-certain death at the hands of a killer freed from prison. He has about an hour to gather a posse of deputies, because together they’ll be able to repel the avenging outlaw when he arrives on the noon train.
As the clock ticks down, the marshal visits one part of the community after another, begging them to help him. And each finds a reason to say no, preferring short-term safety to long-term freedom, community belonging and heroism.
Howard Hawks, director of Rio Bravo,pointedout that the reason that the marshal failed to rally the community was that he wasasking. In search of affiliation, he shared his fears and a story of mutual support as well as loyalty for what he’d done for them for so long.
In Rio Bravo, on the other hand, John Wayne does nothing of the sort. He regularly turns down offers of help, being selective about who’s worthy of being on his team. He shares no fear or trepidation. He’s selling status and dominance, not affiliation. “Are you good enough to be on this team?”
Humans are motivated by affiliation or by status. And in the archetypal old west, it was status that often carried the day. The same might be true for the community that you are part of.","April 17, 2022","Heroism, Community, Affiliation"
The resolution of communication,"What’s better, a phone call or a zoom call?
Which creates more intimacy, a meeting in person or a hand-written letter?
The only answer is: it depends.
It’s tempting to believe that being in a store, surrounded by sights, smells, packaging, crowds and helpful salespeople delivers more interaction and sales than a catalog. But a company like Zingerman’s manages to make a can of sardines sound far more exciting than it would at the deli.
When we communicate, the real issue isn’t how many bits of information are available. Instead, I think there are three forces at work:
Are we using all the information we can? (The baker can choose how the store smells and how the display looks).
Are we showing up with permission, in the right moment?
Is there a path to emotional connection and trust?
Whether it’s connecting with an old friend or hearing from a politician, there’s no universal hi-rez option. It’s more complicated than that.","April 16, 2022","communication, intimacy, emotional connection"
Things to feel bad about,"You might have a list of them. In fact, many of us do, and consult it quite often. The list is defective for a number of reasons:
Lists like this aren’t a helpful way to avoid bad outcomes. But they do allow us to experience the bad outcomes in advance, even the ones that don’t happen. If feeling bad is keeping us from doing things that produce better outcomes, more connection or simply joy, it’s a waste.
The best use of the list might be to write it down, make it complete, carefully put it in a drawer for later. And then forget about it.","April 15, 2022","self-reflection, negative thinking, emotional wellbeing"

Generation C,"We’ve been naming generations for a long time. Demographers use it to begin a conversation about the changes around us. While a birth range doesn’t guarantee an outlook, the demographics and cultural shifts that a group shares tell us a lot about how they might see the world. And the name is a shortcut to remind us that not everyone sees the world the way we do.
The last four are pretty unimaginative if you ask me, but I also know that a baby boomer is probably thinking of the world differently than a millennial is right now. These are inexact labels, but helpful nonetheless.
So what to call the next generation?
My co-authors Bruce Clark and Paige NeJame have coined the term “Generation C.” It’s so well-suited, I believe it’s going to stick.
C is for Covid, C is for Carbon, C is for Climate.
The combination of years of school spent at home, in a mask, combined with the significant revolution (economic, politicalandsocial) that our industrialism has led us to means that this generation will be different than the ones before. Every decision and investment and interaction is going to be filtered through the lens of carbon and remediation and resilience.
And yet, if we combine this with the c of connection, of a cohort of people who are finding solace and possibility in community, there’s a chance for all of us. It will take compassion as well. Generation C didn’t ask for any of this, but I’m hopeful that they’re up for leading the change.","April 12, 2022","Generation C, Covid, Climate"
Not impossible,"Some folks build their work on the frontier of impossible. Breakthrough coding, an astonishing new magic trick, a concerto that takes your breath away.
It’s so remarkable that we’re tempted to believe that this is our job as well. Not every once in a while, but daily. To do what has never been done before, creating emotions that are scarce indeed.
But the scarcity of this sort of work might be the proof we need to realize that it’s not for us to create, at least not today.
Today, we get the chance to lead, to connect and to do work we’re proud of. Work we can describe before we begin, and work we’re confident is worth doing.

Convenience and boredom,"The last fifty years have seen a worldwide effort to maximize one and eliminate the other.
Marketers and technologists work overtime to create convenience. We’ve gone from hunting and growing our food to pressing three buttons on a phone to get it…
And the cost of that convenience is high. We give up privacy, control and satisfaction to get it, in every corner of our lives.
At the same time, the market has figured out that we simply don’t like to be bored. And so there’s more stimulation, more options and more noise than ever before.
The problem is that boredom is a partner with satisfaction and joy. It’s hard to overstimulate ourselves into those feelings.","April 9, 2022","Convenience, Boredom, Satisfaction"
When the gauge is broken,"When your watch stops, it’s unlikely that you believe that time is now standing still. It’s obviously the watch that’s broken, not time.
But when a metric on our culture or a complex machine is functioning poorly, it’s easy to get confused. Is this work actually unpopular, or is the bestseller list not an accurate reporter of what people care about? Is the pump actually overheating, or is the temperature probe broken?
The more complex the system, the more likely we are to believe a broken gauge, even if it’s only right twice a day.

And maybe it’s enough,"To feel sufficient, to be satisfied with what we have:Chisokuin Japanese.
Of course, by some measures, there’s never enough. We can always come up with a reason why more is better, or better is better, or new is better or different is better.
Enough becomes a choice, not a measure of science.
The essence of choice is that it belongs to each of us. And if you decide you have enough, then you do.
And with that choice comes a remarkable sort of freedom. The freedom to be still, to become aware and to stop hiding from the living that’s yet to be done.","April 6, 2022","sufficiency, choice, freedom"
Modern marketing and hustle,"Hustle uses shortcuts and effort to bend the conventions of society to get more than the hustler’s fair share of attention. Hustle burns trust for awareness. Because it’s a shortcut, hustle might deliver in the short-run, but hustle is notably non-consensual. Few people want to be hustled.
Marketing is the work of helping people get what they’ve wanted all along. Marketing is about establishing the conditions for a small group of people to eagerly spread the word and build connection. Modern marketing changes the culture by establishing what the new norms are, and does it in a way that makes things better for those it serves.
Taking attention vs. storytelling and service. Sometimes it feels like the shortcuts and depersonalization and scale are the only option, then a great marketing project comes along and we’re reminded that in fact, we can do work we’re proud of.","April 5, 2022","Hustle, Modern Marketing, Trust"
The surprising thing about expectations,"When you meet expectations, when you make a promise and keep it, when your quality is on spec—we say “of course.”
On the other hand, if you relentlessly raise expectations, if you overpromise and add a bit of hype, you’re almost certain to fail to meet our dreams and hopes. At the same time, though, those raised hopes are their own sort of placebo, an internal cognitive dissonance that will make some people like your work more than if you had simply promised less.
And finally, if you invest the time, care and money to dramatically over-deliver, you probably won’t make as much in profit today, but that imbalance is often made up for with word of mouth in your favor. When you amaze and delight, your fans will pay it forward.
A hundred years into our industrial age, each of these forms of expectation has become its own signal. We’ve established expectations about expectations. You can’t raise money from a VC if you tell them exactly what the numbers are going to be like, and no one would have surgery if surgeons were clear about all the details.
The challenge is to be sure we put the correct expectations in the right categories.","April 4, 2022","expectations, overdelivery, cognitive dissonance"
Anytimed,"It’s not a word, but perhaps it should be.
If a competitor goes after your customers by offering them faster service, all day and all night, you’ve been anytimed.
And if your boss, fearing that event, or simply trying to boost output for free, pushes you to be available all hours of the day and night, you’re being anytimed as well.
The market wants convenience and speed and price. Anytimed is a side effect of that race.","April 3, 2022","Anytimed, convenience, competition"
Catastrophization,"Life’s a tragedy. It always surprises us, and eventually, we all die.
But tragedies don’t have to lead to catastrophes. A catastrophe is a shared emergency that overwhelms our interactions and narratives.
Lately, they’ve become a business model and a never-ending part of our days. If we live in a world driven by attention, catastrophization is a sure way to grab some. It’s a bright red button that causes forward motion to freeze up.
If it helped, it wouldn’t be a problem. If it helped, we could use our resources to make a difference. But it’s not designed to help, it’s designed to shift our focus and activate our emotions.
It might be the catastrophe of world events, or the political scrum or even an unhappy customer on Yelp.
For too long, people with power and privilege simply ignored things that mattered, and catastrophization is a reasonable response–until it begins to undermine the work we need to do. It quickly becomes a version of Pressfield’s resistance, a way to avoid leaning into important projects that might not work–because it’s safer to focus on a thing over there than it is to work on something right here.
And it’s exhausting. Catastrophe fatigue sets in, and we end up losing interest and drifting away, until the next emergency arrives.
Catastrophization ends up distracting us from the long-term systemic work we signed up to do. It’s a signal that we care about what’s happening right now, but it also keeps us from focusing on what’s going to happen soon.
The best way to care is to persist in bending the culture and our systems to improve things over time.","April 2, 2022","Catastrophization, Distraction, Systemic Work"
“Not a heavy lift”,"If you work with your hands and your back, avoiding a heavy lift is totally understandable.
For many of us, though, we work with time or with trust.
If someone asks you to endorse their new project, “it’ll only take a minute,” they’re offering to save you time, but at the risk of the trust you’ve built. That’s not a light lift, it’s a huge risk.
If someone says, “please forward this to everyone in your address book, here’s a simple script to do it automatically,” that is indeed a heavy lift.
Just because it’s fast doesn’t mean it’s worth doing.","April 1, 2022","trust, risk, endorsement"
The delay,"Sometimes we’re not that good with time.
If people got a hacking cough and a chronic disease an hour after smoking their first cigarette, it’s unlikely many people would smoke.
If earthquakes happened a day after fracking for gas was tried, they would probably have stopped.
And if entrepreneurs discovered freedom, satisfaction and customer delight a week after starting their projects, more people would probably give it a go.
Most of us are able to respond to a feedback loop in the short run. The real opportunity and challenge is to get much better at recognizing the long loops.","May 31, 2022","delay, feedback loop, long-term recognition"
Personal responsibility,"It’s complicated. Because we made it complicated.
Our culture is built on the principle that people are responsible for what they do.
And then we spend time and effort diffusing the responsibility.
If you work for a company and are just doing your job, are you responsible?
What if you founded the company?
What if you invest in it?
Are marketers responsible for the negative side effects of increased consumption?
If companies work, if marketing works, if work works, then who is responsible if it causes something to happen?
If we dump something in the river, are we responsible for what happens to people downstream?
What if you buy something from someone who dumps something in the river?
Are we responsible for the actions of the causes we support and the people we vote for?
What about the implications of not supporting something? Are we responsible for the bad things that happen because of our apathy?

Expressing something,"In an episode of a podcast I really respect, three of the experts quoted used words that I was familiar with:Debunk,gaslightingandcult. These are powerful words, words with specific and evocative meanings.
In all three cases, the people speaking used them ‘wrong.’
Being on a podcast might be nerve-wracking, and in an effort to overcome anxiety, sound smart and level up, each person ended up doing the opposite.
But that’s how language works. We’re trying to say what we mean, and sometimes, it’s not what other people think we meant. The emotions behind the words are real, even if the words are a mismatch.
When it happens often enough, the words develop a new meaning.
Words are a moving target, an expression of feelings, and they inevitably shift.

Craft and imperfection,"As soon as we mechanize, measure and perfect something, it becomes far less interesting.
There’s not a lot of discussion about which factory made your can of Coke, because they’re all the same.

How change happens,"Slowly then all at once
For people who aren’t paying attention or actively involved, it can seem like cultural change is sudden. One big shift after another.
In fact, cultural change always happens relatively slowly. Person by person, conversation by conversation. Expectations are established, roles are defined, systems are built.
From the foundation
The people in the news and at the podium get all the attention, but they’re a symptom, not usually a cause. Everyday people aren’t the bottom, they are the roots, the foundation, the source of culture itself. We are the culture, and we change it or are changed by it.
From peer to peer
Change happens horizontally. What do we expect from others? What do we talk about? Who do we emulate or follow or support? What becomes the regular kind?
People like us do things like this.
Day by day, week by week, year by year.
Going to the protest of the day, performing acts of slacktivism, hopping from urgency to emergency–this is how people who day trade in our culture are whipsawed. But the people who are consistently and actively changing the culture are not easily distracted. One more small action, one more conversation, one more standard established.
The internet would like us to focus on what happened five minutes ago. The culture understands that what happens in five years is what matters.
Focused, persistent community action is how systems change. And systems concretize and enforce cultural norms.
If you care, keep talking. Keep acting. Stay focused. And don’t get bored.","May 27, 2022","Cultural Change, Community Action, Persistent Engagement"

There are many good reasons to do so, and few downsides.

First, a quick clarification because this is confusing to many people: The thing you use to browse the internet is not a search engine. Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Safari–these are web browsers. A browser is software that allows you to look at any web page–and these companies often make money by selling your attention to the search engine that bids the most. Apple takesbillionsof dollars a year from Google in exchange for steering you to their search engine.
And the reason that Google bids so much is that they make an insane amount of money. Billions of dollars a year from serving up ads and harvesting your data from your searches. That money needs to come from somewhere.

Looking at taxes,"Ever since there have been taxes, people have been against paying them.
If we define a tax as a “non-productive burden on our activities,” then it makes sense. And a payment doesn’t have to be to the government to be a tax.
Is paying your electric bill a tax? Most people don’t mind paying for electricity, because it makes their lives safer and happier, and helps them do their job with dramatically more productivity.
So the payment isn’t what makes something a tax, it’s the non-productive part.
When industrial systems arrive, they’re usually embraced because the transactions they offer are so productive. When Walmart comes to a town, everyone gets a short-term raise, because the cost of buying the things we want and need goes down. When a new technology or system offers to save people time and money in the short run, it’s often embraced because it’s a free choice and productive.
But then the rules start to change.
Monopolies are a tax. They limit choice and raise prices. As a result, we pay “taxes” on a regular basis for things like broadband and spare parts because there are no options.
Loss of vibrant markets is a tax. When local businesses are upended, then jobs are lost, choices are diminished and the essence of a community fades away.
Lobbying is a tax. As large industrial entities invest money to capture government control, each of us pay for this even though it only benefits the lobbyists.
Subsidies and duties are a tax. Last year, Americans spent 50 billion dollars subsidizing the beef industry.  Constraints on trade aren’t called taxes, but they are.
Traffic is a tax. The time we spend waiting for a train or sitting in traffic is time we don’t get back, and unmade investments in mass transit infrastructure cost us far more than the ones we do make.
Lack of public health systems is a tax. The inability to find clean water, or the prospect of often getting ill is a real cost.
And climate change is a looming and sneaky tax. The money and loss of productivity that it already costs us, and the extraordinary amounts it will cost us are unproductive burdens on meeting our goals and living our lives.
There are no government taxes on an abandoned desert island. But it’s almost impossible to imagine living or working there.","May 24, 2022","Taxes, Productivity, Monopolies"
Sharp language,"The internet has provided all of us with an advanced class on using innuendo, piercing invective and anger to make a point with our writing.
Now, instead of simply seething or ranting, just about anyone can write an email or a social media post that absolutely destroys someone else.
To what end?
If the goal is to persuade, it’s clearly not working.
If we want to let someone know we’re upset, it might be easier to just say so.
The purpose of speech is to alert others to our point of view, and the purpose of conversation is to connect and to persuade.
It’s not clear that making language angrier or more cutting is helping much.","May 23, 2022","sharp language, communication, persuasion"
The smallest viable audience,"It’s a stepping-stone, not a compromise.
The media and our culture push us to build something for everyone, to sand off the edges and to invest in infrastructure toward scale.
But it turns out that quality, magic and satisfaction can lie in the other direction. Not because we can’t get bigger, but because we’d rather be better.
One of the three bestrestaurantsin New York only has 14 seats. With the right fan base and technology, that’s enough to allow the chef to build an experience he can be proud of. Down the street is an extraordinarycafethat pays a tiny fraction of the rent that a midtown neighborhood would require. It’s not about getting found by everyone. A focus on experience creates something that (some) people want to look for.

The strategy of the smallest viable audience doesn’t let you off the hook–it does the opposite. You don’t get to say, “well, we’ll just wait for the next random person to find us.” Instead, you have to choose your customers–who’s it for and what’s it for. And when you’ve identified them, the opportunity/requirement is to create so much delight and connection that they choose to spread the word to like-minded peers.
Not everyone, but someone. And it turns out that ‘someone’ isn’t as easy as it sounds. When you strip away the alternative mantra of “you can pick anyone, and we’re anyone,” then you have to lean into the obligation of being the sort of provider that people would miss if you were gone. That’s not easy, but people with this sort of focus wouldn’t have it any other way.
Specificity is the way.It has nothing to do with absolute scale and everything to do with being really clear about what hook you want to be on and setting a standard for producing work that people connect to and are changed by.

Switch before perfect,"In 1993, when I was raising investment for one of the first internet companies, there weren’t any firms that specialized in this sort of thing. They were VCs from a different era, looking for the next Fedex or pharma company.
I pitched dozens of them, and the answer was consistent, “get back to us when this is irresistible and then of course we’ll say yes.”
The same thinking is applied to many new products, from vegan burgers to online services. None of them are perfect at first, just as none of the things we’re reliant on today began as perfect.
And yet, some folks went first. Some, like Jerry and Fred, started a VC fund that had record returns because they invested in internet companies that weren’t perfect (yet). And some consumers bought things from the local store when version .5 wasn’t quite ready yet.
If you want to leap forward, you’ll need to ship things before they’re perfect, mostly to people who want to buy them before they are.","May 20, 2022","1. Imperfection

False metrics appearing real,"Just because they’re easy to measure doesn’t mean they matter.
If they appear in round numbers and are easily compared to those from others, we’re tempted to compare.
But something that looks like a useful metric might not be.
If you’re working with people who say they care about measurement, it might not pay to persuade them to stop measuring.
It might make more sense to give them useful numbers to measure instead.","May 19, 2022","false metrics, measurement, useful numbers"
Possibility is fragile,"And that’s the paradox, because the closer possibility gets to reality, the more it engages with the unforgiving edges of the real world.
As we begin to imagine something better, it’s important to have some insulation, room to believe and a chance to fill in the missing pieces.
But then we have to allow the constraints of reality to intersect with our beautiful new conception.
And when that happens, it’s easy for all of our imaginings to simply evaporate.
But fragile doesn’t mean impossible. Possibility looms around every corner if we’re willing to bring resilience and iteration to the dance as well.
Yes, it might not work. But deciding that in advance undermines the value of the gift we intended to bring people.",,"possibility, resilience, imagination"
The grandstanders,"This is a common sort of feedback/criticism/brainstorming, and it deserves a name.
Show up toward the end, when most of the work has been done and it’s almost time to ship…
Make a suggestion that would require changing a great deal of what’s been done. It might even be a good suggestion on its face, but it’s hard to tell…
Contribute your suggestion without having built a body of work, without evidence of significant expertise and without being willing to take responsibility for what happens next.
It’s a form of yelling from the bleachers.
The fact that your idea is fresh or innovative doesn’t change the role of Resistance. This sort of suggestion is a great place to hide. You’re helping, aren’t you? And if they ignore you, well, that’s on them.
The grandstander wants to be part of things, but isn’t showing up to do the hard part.
This might be the guest who shows up half an hour before dinner and suggests you change the menu.
Or the publicist that wants to weigh in on the product’s design a week before launch.
Or the good friend who wonders out loud if you should marry him, right after your four-year relationship turns into an engagement.
The alternative is to get out of the bleachers and into the field. Do the training. Show your work. Engage early. Own the outcomes.

Please share the extra with a friend,"Krispy Kreme grew to become a doughnut behemoth in the US. The formula was simple: Scarce supply, high short-term taste satisfaction, and a dozen priced almost the same as just four.
As a result, most people bought a dozen. But few could eat a dozen, and you can’t really save them, so you realized that sharing a warm doughnut was the way to go.
Carmine’s restaurant in New York was the hot ticket for decades. One reason was that the only way to get a reservation was to come with five other people. So you needed to talk about it.
I’ve learned in sharing galleys ofThe Carbon Almanacthat sending two is far more useful and beneficial than sending one. Because when someone gets two, they immediately decide to share the other one. Organizing around ‘please share’ is a choice.
We’re building aWall of Fameon our website to celebrate companies that care enough about our future to share copies of the Almanac when it comes out. Small companies can easily find a good use for five or ten copies, and we’ve made it easy and cost-effective to pre-order. The form is to sign up ishere. All participants get a link back to their site and a chance to make an impact in the world.

Newbies welcome,"The paradox of most tightly-knit communities is that they have an internal culture.
And that culture often makes it difficult for a new person to join. It’s hard to have insiders if you don’t have outsiders. This is true for guilds of copy editors, fans of anime or branches of science.
The key transition point for any cause or tribe or movement that seeks to grow is to shift from an insular desire to keep things as they are to a willingness–or better, a desire–to water things down by getting bigger.

More information is only useful if it helps you make a decision. Knowing the temperature on Saturn isn’t useful. Knowing it to even more accuracy is less useful. That’s because we’re not making any decisions that involve the temperature on another planet.
We’re surrounded by data that our spreadsheets or networks or cohorts seem to want us to be aware of. How many people clicked yesterday, or what someone wrote in a comment, what a backlist book sold or the foot traffic in that store vs. this store.
But if you’re not going to use the data to make a decision, don’t spend the time to expose yourself to it. It’s resistance at work.

The post-industrial collision,"Many knowledge-economy employees say that the main cause of dissatisfaction at work is lack of agency. Lack of control over our time and our decisions and our output is demeaning. It turns people into cogs.
As the nature of work changes, innovation and small groups are adding far more value than the race to the bottom of industrial control can.
So people are getting what they asked for. Autonomy. Responsibility instead of authority. The chance to speak up and be heard. Most of all, the opportunity to be on the hook.
Not surprisingly, some people, particularly if they’ve been indoctrinated into the industrial mindset, don’t like this.
They can’t ask, “just tell me what to do.” The search for an A, the hope to be picked by someone in charge, the desire for perfect–it’s gone. So is the deniability that comes with following instructions.

People exploit vulnerabilities in systems, or cut a little close to one edge or another. Because, after all, it’s a competitive world, and if they don’t, someone else will.

The ones who didn’t help,"If 2% of a population takes coordinated action, it makes a difference. If 5% do, it can change everything.
This simple math also means that most people rarely do anything. Perhaps they don’t care. Perhaps they’re afraid to speak up and commit. And perhaps it’s simply easier to go along for a free ride.
Of course it hurts when friends and colleagues we thought we could count on shirk and hide. But everyone has their own narrative, their own issues, their own fears. We can say, “if I were you,” but we’re not them, they are.
When we focus on the ones who didn’t help, we’re undermining our work. It’s a distraction and a disservice.

We eagerly regulate things like dangerous goods, fraud, insider trading, the warranty of merchantability, trademarks, dumping poison in the water supply, selling heroin to kids, etc.
All of these boundaries are designed to create more resilient markets. Markets that serve newcomers as well as insiders. Markets that eventually serve the culture.
We’re not very good at it, but trying is the only way forward. The right question isn’t, “how do we remove regulations?” It might be, “how do we make this more resilient over time?”","May 8, 2022","resilient markets, regulation, free market"

It might be our personality, the structure of the engagement or the way we’ve been taught to behave, but having an enemy seems to focus individuals and groups.

Half baked,"If you care about a creative practice, my guess is that you’ve already seen Peter Jackson’s new Beatles movie. If not, go check it out.
It’s a miracle that the movie exists at all. I mean, four of the most famous creative humans who ever lived, tenuously holding on to a fracturing association, agree to write and record an album in three weeks andrecord every single interaction on film.
The intimacy of this setting lets us see each of the Beatles as they had decided to become.
Ringo is in the background, happy to be there, supporting the process and causing no trouble.
George is wrestling with his place in the world and his ego. You’ll notice that he rarely plays a song unless he’s sure it’s almost done, and even then, apologizes before sharing it.
John is the fifth hammer. In the first sessions, his creative method is not really on display in the group setting–his song arrives already recorded, on vinyl.
This is a post about Paul.
Paul’s not a genius, neither is John. This isn’t about talent, it’s about skill. And the genius that was the Beatles happensbetweenPaul and John, not inside of either of them.
Paul wants the group to be excited. He wants George to be happier. Most of all, he wants John to like his songs. That’s his fuel.
And Paul’spracticeis simple: Bring the work forward.
Play a song before it’s ready.
Because in the moment before it’s ready, that’s when it’s ready.
By bringing music that’s half-baked to the table, he takes a risk. It means that George might become critical or mopey. It means that John might not be engaged. It means that the room might not feel it.
But the risk is worth it. Because the half-baked work, shared in a trusting environment, is the fuel for the system that created the works of genius.
Paul needed the movie and the live event in the future to create tension, tension that he knew would be pushing against the group’s need for approval and not-blowing-it. By putting themselves in a corner, he created (at no small cost) the conditions where he could do the work.
And it begins, as it usually does, by having the guts to share something that’s half baked.

Going for baroque,"The essence of baroque art and craft is its complexity. Difficult to create, overloaded with ornamentation, filled with grandeur and color and surprise, the focus is on the effort expended.
And that dramatic display of effort has a place. It communicates a sort of emotional labor, and creates an imbalance of status. You don’t expect a scoop of rice and some dal at a very fancy restaurant, no matter how delicious it is. You paid for the effort, not just the sustenance.
Baroque is often at odds with utility. I don’t want a hammer with a baroque design, I want one that does precisely what I need it to when it comes to driving a nail. On the other hand, much of what we buy and use isn’t about utility at all… it’s an expression of the story we tell ourselves about value, status and our place in the world.

But it can also lull us into a stupor of clicks, likes, home deliveries and spectatorship.

Sunk costs at work,"For skilled information workers, job mobility has never been easier or more profitable.
And yet, countless people stay where they are, without ever considering why.
For example, there are hundreds of senior leaders and contributors at Twitter who haven’t quit their jobs in the last week. Even though they have a financial cushion, a technical reputation and are facing the prospect of working for a new boss who has little respect for what they’ve worked on for years.
Sunk costsare powerful.
Some people stay where they are because they value unearned options in ways that undervalue their upside potential at a different gig.
Some people stay where they are because they’ve worked hard to get where they are and don’t want to risk it.
And some people stay because thinking about alternative options feels risky, and feelings of risk are tempting to avoid.
But with work-from-home, transferable networks and valuable tech skills, there are now millions of people who might benefit from thinking hard about what they hope to contribute in the future.

Compounded luck,"If you and I play a game of cards, the winner will largely be decided by luck. Get good cards and you come out ahead.
If you and I play 100 games of backgammon, the better player will win, because the luck of the dice regress to the mean, evening out over time, leaving skill as the dominant factor.
Good game design involves creating the conditions where early luck doesn’t destroy the rest of the game. A good roll or a good first hand shouldn’t eliminate the opportunity for other players to have a chance. This is why Monopoly is a more accurate social commentary than it is a good game.
When people talk about life and say, “there’s no such thing as luck,” they might be referring to the fact that in the long run, people who are prepared, persistent and granted the benefit of the doubt often do okay. But what they’re missing is that life (and our culture) isn’t constructed as a game that doesn’t reward early luck.
Early luck has a massive impact. Where you’re born, the caste society puts you in, whether or not you were appropriately precocious in various early ranking systems–these all get compounded. Malcolm Gladwell has written about birth month having a significant factor in who gets to play in the NHL–because where a Canadian kid plays hockey when he’s six adds up over the decades.
[If you’re a sports fan, that means we could create a second NHL, with just as many star players, simply by creating a different farm system for kids born six months later].
Compounding early luck is generally fine with people who have early luck. What a surprise. But it’s unfair and it’s also a talent-utilization problem that hurts everyone. When we fail to create the conditions for people to persist with resilience until the luck comes along, we all lose.
Organizations have the opportunity to invest in the long haul. They can take profits from early luck and apply them to areas where upsides will eventually appear. This is the secret of successful VCs likeBrad FeldandFred Wilson. A portfolio is a simple way to reduce the impact of luck (good or bad) over time.
But we’re all in organizations. We have a chance to not confuse early luck with skill, and take the steps to build enough resilience into our journey that we’re more likely to get where we’re going.","June 30, 2022","Luck, Skill, Opportunity"

Thoughts on the solstice,"For half the planet, today is the longest day of the year. For the rest of us, the shortest.
There was a solstice before there were people. All of our other holidays don’t fit that definition. They’re invented. Short-lived. Worldwide, it’s a moment to realize that this is the only planet in the known universe that can sustain human life.
And the planet is changing. We’re changing it.
It’s worth knowing how it’s changing, understanding the implications and deciding to work for systemic change. Because it’s not too late, but we need to see the change that’s happening, right now.
Many believe that it’s worth understanding and sharing the information. We can’t make things better if we can’t see what’s going on.

The rise of placebos,"I’m a fan of appropriateplacebos. They often have few side effects, they’re inexpensive and they work when used in the right situations. You can check out my rant on themhere, it’s been read millions of times to date.
A placebo isn’t just a medical intervention. It’s any tool we use to feel better in a complicated world. They don’t just make us feel better, sometimes they actually change our physiology and can make us better. A wine label is a placebo for some (expensive wine tastes better, until the labels are obscured) and evensearch enginesatisfaction largely comes from the story we tell ourselves about what we’re using to do the search.
Many forms of marketing are actually efforts to build placebo effects.
But how do we pick them? Why is chicken soup good for a cold but not tomato soup or turkey soup?
And why are we seeing (often to our detriment) a rise in nostrums, conspiracies and stories around things that used to be driven by facts and replicable studies?
For a placebo to be effective, our brain needs room to maneuver. That probably involves:
• Complicated problems
• Taking place over time
• That have emotional implications
When those conditions exist, our minds look for an explanation, firm footing and a chance to make things better.
But that’s always been true. The other factor is that we need to hear about a placebo from someone who had it work. The power of suggestion requires that a suggestion be made.
If an influential person was dieting on chicken soup when their cold naturally got better, it’s not difficult to ascribe the improvement to the soup. Because the placebo was around when the disease ran its course, we associate the soup with the improvement. We can then tell others (increasing our confidence, status and affiliation) in an effort to generously improve the health of our friends. Some of them will also be eating soup when their cold improves, further cementing the advantage that chicken soup has in the race to be the placebo of choice for colds.
We had plenty of placebos of every kind a thousand years ago. We had no idea why the sun rose, why the snow fell and why someone got sick. Placebos were essential for our emotional well-being. But the rise of the scientific method moved many of these stories to the side, because we understood things more clearly, and things that were complicated became less so.
In the last ten years or so, we’re seeing a shift happen.
And, as always, the internet is the agent of change here. The internet has given people a chance to share their fears and confusion and frustration about the world, particularly complicated things that happen over time. The world is not getting more complicated, but our fears and confusions are getting more widely shared, which makes it feel more complicated. Few people rant about gravity, but it’s easy to see mystery or even conspiracy in events and trends that are less simple.
If someone suggests a placebo as a cure, a palliative or a cultural touchstone, it might be used by others. And some that use it will find that it was present as things got better, and so it gains in currency. Not because it worked in the way that vitamin C works to cure scurvy, but worked in the sense that it was co-existent with something else happening.
Placebos that give us solace and patience with no side effects are magical. Alas, when we apply them to areas where we’d be better off doing something that has a more direct impact, we’re making a mistake that costs us and those around us as well.","June 20, 2022","placebos, belief, emotional well-being"
The arc of history,"By every geologic measure, modern human life is a tiny blip, a spark of static on a very long-playing record.
For most of the time that life has existed on Earth, there were no humans. And when there were human-like creatures, they spent much of their time doing not much. Nomads eat when they need to, move around and hang out. It’s not an easy life, but there are none of the modern distractions or problems that urban culture presents.
Grain began to change things, because agriculture produces far more calories per acre, allowing populations to grow… and to store the results of our labor. Stored grain, though, is easier to steal and to tax than something that must be eaten fresh off the tree or harvested.
And so you get markets and wars and governments and the rise of a group of people wealthier than any individual farmer or nomad could be.
This is all mostly irrelevant. It’s irrelevant in the way that understanding how Edison made movies or sound recordings is irrelevant. It’s nice to know the history, but it doesn’t help you win an Oscar or a Grammy.
The two most relevant forces are in a powerful dance right now:
• The carbon-fueled growth of industry.
• The information-fueled growth of ideas and connection.
Industrychanged the way the Earth looks from space, it enriched billions of people and it has driven our species to the brink of extinction due to our impact on the climate. It has often been based on caste and coercion, and created both opportunities and problems.
Connectionhas enabled culture to thrive, and in recent years, amplified by the noise of the internet, it’s also made many people miserable in the short-run.
As we slog through another long, challenging year, one in which these two forces conflict, amplify and engage with each other, I’m remembering what Theodore Parker said more than 150 years ago:
I do not pretend to understand the moral universe, the arc is a long one, my eye reaches but little ways. I cannot calculate the curve and complete the figure by the experience of sight; I can divine it by conscience. But from what I see I am sure it bends towards justice.
We really don’t have a lot of choice about yesterday. Here we are, many of us with more leverage and power than any human on Earth had just a hundred years ago.
In the last few decades, so many areas of culture have moved forward that defenders of the status quo are becoming exhausted trying to defend what was. And they sometimes express that exhaustion through anger, division and vitriol.
The good news is that we have exactly what we need to make things better. If enough of us stand up and lead and connect, we’ll continue to get closer to what’s possible.

Pay once, but come out ahead over and over again.
There are habits, assets and learnings that seem too expensive right now. And so we simply stick with our status quo.

Carrying costs,"How much does a puppy cost?

Problems now (problems later),"People always addressnowproblems before they work onlaterproblems.
Every time.
On one night in 2004, you might have had two choices. You could go out for a fancy dinner with friends, or you could buy one share of Google at their IPO. A couple of decades later, your dinner is forgotten but the shares are up many times.
Of course, some people did buy that stock. That’s not because they encountered an opportunity to save for their retirement 18 years later. It’s because they told themselves a story that people in their shoes sent money to the marketthat day.They turned a problem in the future (retirement) into a problem for the now (I’m a loser if I go out to this dinner instead).
Our story about the future is in the now, regardless of how far away the future is.
All we can do with the future is experience our story about it right now.
All problems are short-term problems if we tell ourselves the right story. But we usually don’t, because we discount the future significantly. A grilled cheese sandwich today is more important than two grilled cheese sandwiches next week. Unless we tell ourselves a present and urgent story about what it feels like to ignore the future.
Because sooner or later, we live in the present. A present filled with stories and cultural pressure and the urgencies we invent for ourselves.","June 14, 2022","future, decision-making, storytelling"
"Handmade, original and significant","There are still pockets of our culture where a single individual can create and share a body of work that’s resonant and unique.
I’ve become hooked on a podcast called A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs.
I’m now a backer onPatreon. The show is athttps://500songs.com/[My suggestion is that you start with a song you know and love instead of beginning at the beginning.]
It’s simply extraordinary. Trivia connected to cultural commentary connected to the endless web of the pop music world. Hundreds of hours of insight and connection, all written, narrated and produced by a single person.
There’s a lot to be said about the power of teams to create art and magic. But there’s still room for individuals to do this as well.

Push vs. pull,"The non-networked world was driven by push. The merchant stocked goods and waited for you to come buy them. The manufacturer made things in advance and advertised so you’d go buy them. The cab waited by the corner hoping you’d come out and hail it. The door-to-door salesperson went door to door…
But the web amplifies pull instead. When you need something, you tell Google or Amazon or Lyft or Shopify and they bring it to you. The ratio of inventory to demand has shifted dramatically–instead of one encyclopedia in every single house that sits idly waiting for you to need it, there’s just one Wikipedia, available to be pulled by anyone, at will.
When we seek to make change, our instinct is to start pushing. But shifting to pull can create efficiencies that can’t be matched by mass promotion.","June 12, 2022","Push vs. Pull, Inventory, Efficiency"
The coyote’s anguish,"It’s one of the best metaphors for life, marketing, achievement, community and possibility in all of TV cartooning.
The coyote is always looking for a quick win. Because he doesn’t persist with a plan that builds over time, all of his outlandish stunts add up to nothing but frustration.
The coyote is obsessed with gaining at the expense of his enemy. As a result, he’s faced with either defeat or short-lived and ultimately empty victory.
The coyote is obviously immortal, but he’s always in pain. Either in the pain that comes from hitting a wall at 100 miles an hour, or the pain of knowing that yet another short-term plan came to no good.
The coyote challenges the laws of physics in the belief that he, and he alone is entitled to his own rules.
The coyote is happy to spend money on ludicrous devices that make promises he must know are empty, but instead of investing, he keeps chasing the gimmicks.
The coyote picked the wrong goal. Even though it’s clear he can’t succeed, he doesn’t switch, obsessing about sunk costs instead.
And even though he has experienced the frustration of the short-term selfish shortcut again and again, he never pauses to consider what would happen if he created something of value instead.","June 11, 2022","coyote, persistence, short-term gains"
Marketing vs. promotion,"People often use the words to mean the same thing, but they’re different.
If an exterminator puts signs and banners in front of a fancy house when they’re inside killing rats, that’s promotion. But it’s not good marketing.
Marketing is creating the conditions for a story to spread so you can help people get to where they hope to go. Marketing is work that matters for people who care, a chance to create products and services that lead to change.
Promotion can support that. Or it might simply be a selfish hustle for attention.

Scale vs. Speed: Why organizations slow down,"If you compare a Starbucks of ten years ago to a current one, they’re virtually the same. Compare this to the originals in Seattle, and the difference is startling.
The same goes for the design of a typical McDonald’s.
Apple launched the Mac with about a dozen full-time people working on its development. Today, they have more than a thousand times as many engineers and they haven’t launched a groundbreaking product in a while.
The same goes for Google. And Slack.
It’s not just famous big brands. Just about every organization hits a point where the pace of innovation slows as scale increases.
This happens for a number of reasons, and there are two ways to deal with them.
Technical debtis the result of shortcuts taken to get things to work right now. As a result of these shortcuts, the software (or hardware) isn’t easily expandable for future needs.
Handshake overheadis the result of the simple law of more people. n*(n – 1)/2. Two people need one handshake to be introduced. On the other hand, 9 people need 36 handshakes. More people involve more meetings, more approvals, more coordination.
Customer commitmentsare an asset but also a brake on innovation. The customers you already have didn’t necessarily sign up for you to change things.
Partner preferencesare similar to customer commitments. The partners you work with have their own objectives and pace, the easiest common denominator is ‘slower.’
Wall Street’s fearis common, but fading a bit. This is the instinct that many institutional investors have to avoid the unknown. “The stock is going up, don’t blow it.”
Managerial anxietyis what happens when an operating bureaucracy comes to replace daring leadership. People get promoted because they’re good at their jobs, and innovation isn’t an opportunity, it’s a threat.
So, what to do? Ignoring everything above isn’t going to work. Tasking your people to burn all candles at both ends and to change their approach, while also violating the laws of institutional physics is simply not going to work. You’ll hit the wall. Every time.
There are two useful options:
Boring as a strategyis the approach that Apple and a large number of famous brands have taken. As you cross thechasm, the bulk of your new customers don’t want innovation at all. They want promises kept, a lack of surprises and reasonable prices and efficiency. Shipping your improvements on a regular schedule and bringing predictability to your offering allows you to reach more people and make a bigger impact. Small innovations allow an organization to avoid falling too far behind innovative competitors, and it can take decades before the gap is big enough to matter. And then you become Yahoo. Or Chrysler. Or Carvel.
Structural bankruptcyis a daring alternative. Create a skunkworks. Refactor your code from scratch. Spin off the cash cow and assemble a team to start something new from scratch. The new things probably won’t work at first, but if you do enough of them, your experience and persistence will pay off.
I’ve faced these choices many times in my career, and neither choice is easy or obvious, but the choice itself shouldn’t be ignored. If you simply hope for the best of both worlds, you’re likely to be frustrated at the same time you disappoint the people you work with and serve.","June 8, 2022","Innovation, Scale, Strategy"
Paying extra,"For six years, if you wanted an electric car, you’d need to pay extra. It cost more than the regular kind.
Of course, if you decided to buy one, you weren’t payingextra. You were buying sustainability, community awareness, cachet, status, safety, quiet and the feeling of being an early adopter.
People never pay extra.
They buy something they want at a price that feels fair to them.
In the next few years, electric cars are actually going to be cheaper than their more-polluting brethren. And that means that anyone who wants to charge a premium is going to have to offer quality, service, design and a feeling that it’s worth whatever is being charged.
It’s very difficult to make a living selling something that doesn’t, by some apparent measure, cost extra.
The hard work is in keeping the promise that your extra isn’t extra at all.","June 7, 2022","electric cars, sustainability, pricing"
What are things like around here?,"Industries are often held together by unspoken hierarchies, signposts on the road to achievement.
In the fancy parts of the book business, it’s not profit. Editors are often unaware of which books are truly profitable. They keep track of cultural impact, literary respect, the idea of a book being ‘well published’ and the hard-to-measure currency of ‘important’.
The Kindle and the long tail changed that, with new entrants keeping track of something else.
The “A” list movies, on the other hand, have an entire circle of status that’s organized around Academy Awards, famous directors and a pecking order that would be invisible to many of us.
Netflix and Youtube changed that as well, with new entrants keeping track of shorter cycles and different metrics.
In Silicon Valley, which has been an engine of our future for thirty years, technical prowess and elegance were the key drivers.
Now, the focus has shifted to simplicity, memes and momentary cultural currency in search of big numbers. The new signposts are about cultural ubiquity, IPOs, quick flips and harvesting data.
Apps instead of programs, user interfaces that need no instructions and don’t really reward a lot of effort, and output that’s driven by both. Like a roach motel, the goal is to make it seductive and hard to escape.
The hierarchies of status drive decisions far more than we realize. We often architect the systems that create our culture without paying attention to why.","June 6, 2022","hierarchies, cultural impact, metrics"
Skepticism and Denial,"Skepticism is a virtue. It requires a willingness to question conventional wisdom, and the guts to accept something after you discover that it’s actually true.
Denialism, on the other hand, is a willful rejection of reality. It’s safe and easy, and unproductive. Because there’s no room to change your mind.
To be a generous skeptic, we need to state in advance specifically what it would take for us to engage with the proposed insight, and then do so after our standards are met.
This is hard work. It’s not easy to change one’s mind. Difficult but worth it. Big shifts in perception are rare and it’s not something we look forward to.
Skeptics are a key to the scientific method, organizational design and even investing. We sign up to doubt and question and push, and then we become productive contributors by embracing the new tools and results.
Often, people in denial pretend to be skeptics. It feels more powerful than acknowledging that we’re simply avoiding change.","June 5, 2022","Skepticism, Denialism, Change"
Interested vs. interesting,"Of course you’re interesting. There’s something about what you’ve done, what you say, how you show up in the world that’s worthy of interest.
But that doesn’t mean that people are interested.
We each have a noise in our heads, an agenda and something urgent that’s grabbing our attention. And so, the amount of interest you receive (or don’t receive) has little to do with how interesting you are and a lot to do with how the people you seek to serve have organized their priorities long before you got there.","June 4, 2022","interest, attention, priorities"
The next train,"It’s not a luxury, it’s a choice.
We can build slack into our lives. We can create cycles so that we don’t need to dance with a crisis around time on a regular basis.
If there’s another train after this one, you don’t have to fret.
If the deadline for the project is tomorrow, not today, you don’t have to sweat it.
If the guests aren’t arriving for an hour…
Sometimes, we choose to use the urgent crisis as fuel. We set up our lives around creating these deadlines, reminding ourselves that if we cross that line, we’re dead.
And then we allow the world to do it to us. To create urgencies simply to take our attention and focus.

Failing in the trough,"There’s a time gap.
Marketers raise expectations in order to get someone to sign up and try a product and service.
And (hopefully) there’s satisfaction, delight and remarkability once the organization actually delivers on what you promised.
In between, the trough.
You spend $400 per customer on rent and architecture and web design.
Perhaps it’s $200 per new customer on podcast ads or salespeople.
All of these expenses happen long before you deliver.
And then, you confront the new customer with a surly receptionist, a website that is hard to understand, a wait for a table, a mismatch in the professional you assign, slow customer service, packaging that is difficult to open, fine print that suddenly becomes obnoxious and expectations that aren’t met.
In this trough, we have a few options:
The first, the most common, is to try to ignore it. Let em seethe. Bet on time and momentum and sunk costs to get them over the hump.
The second, a variation of this, is to spend as little as you can to address the problem of the trough. Acknowledge the problem, sure, but throw boilerplate and your lowest cost (least trained, least respected) people at the problem.
The third, the intelligent, difficult choice, is to invest in onboarding.
At $50 an hour, a well-trained, passionate and committed person might be able to onboard four customers an hour. That’s $12.50 to protect the $300 to $800 (or more) it cost you to earn that customer’s trial in the first place.
This person isn’t a replacement for what you sell or deliver. This person is the bridge over the trough.
They’re the patient voice at the end of the phone (who picks up on one ring) to help with a recalcitrant bit of software. Or the person who sends a handwritten note telling the guest what to expect when they get to your hotel. Or the human who simply calls to say ‘hi’ as soon as the trough begins. Not reading a script, but working as hard to make a connection and a difference as your ads and your location do.
The key rhetorical question, usually unasked and unanswered: Is it an expense or an investment?
Notes: Promotion is the time and expense of encouraging non-customers to raise their expectations.
The trough kicks in when reality intrudes, when we’re trying to understand what’s actually involved, when sunk costs become clear and when buyer’s remorse begins. It’s the form, the warmup act and that feeling of being alone at a cocktail party filled with people who know each other.
Many of your potential lifelong, supportive and profitable customers never materialize on the other side of the trough, because they left before you had a chance to delight them.
Actual marketing success happens after the trough, when people become loyal, when the product or service isremarkableand when the word spreads.","June 2, 2022","customer onboarding, marketing expectations, customer experience"
In search of hypocrites,"Why would we want to wait until someone is perfect before we give them a chance to make things better?
Each of us is part of a system, cogs in a process that rewards us for certain actions based on various inputs.
When the system is broken, some of the most highly leveraged, aware and insightful people notice. And of course, since they’re part of the system, they’ve been affected by it.

We’d like to believe that our experiences are aligned with the world as it is.
They can’t be. Everything we encounter is filtered through what we know. And what we know comes from the very human cultures we inhabit.
When someone rejects you for a job, they’re not rejecting you. How could they be? They don’t know you. Instead, they’re rejecting theirstoryof you, the best approximation they had combined with the complicated story they (all of us) tell ourselves about our needs, dreams and fears.
We take these stories and we compound them. We sharpen them, rehearse them and turn them into an augmented version of the world as we see it, not the world as it is.

If, on the other hand, your proposal is based on belief and opinion, tell us. You’re entitled to both. And the rest of us are allowed to disagree.

Management with intent,"When Frederic Taylor brought the worldScientific Managementa hundred years ago, it changed what it meant to run a factory. Stopwatches and assembly lines dramatically outperformed the traditional piecemeal approach.
Henry Ford wrote a four page article for Encyclopedia Brittanica about how organizations could embrace the new model, and his focus on this lowered the price of a car by 80% or more.
I’m confident that car companies like Dusenberg and Pierce Arrow felt this new approach was beneath them. They probably made thoughtful arguments about esprit de corps and the magic of a hand-built auto. But they’re gone now.
Video conferencing, the pandemic and the powerful shifts that knowledge work and the internet have caused are at least as significant a shift in work as the stopwatch was.
And yet the Washington Post sent a memo to its reporters telling them that if they didn’t come into the office three days a week, they’d be fired.
That’s because an executive there has decided that “the office” and “work” are the same thing. Even though reporters generally report, and reporting is generally done anywhere except in the office.
Was there something special about hanging out over coffee, greeting people in the lobby and gossiping every day at the water cooler? Of course. But these were side effects of good work in the office, not the cause of it.
If a manager says, “the only way I can create connections, loyalty and a sense of purpose is to force people to shlep to an office every day,” they’re being lazy. Surely we can come up with something better than simply taking attendance.
If it’s important to have your brilliant designer review the work of junior architects in person, then do it on purpose. Schedule it and make it worth the focus and effort. If you believe that loyalty and communication increase when people have regular physical interactions without a screen in between them, then build this into the schedule for the work that’s being done, don’t simply wait for it to accidentally happen.
As knowledge work has shifted to a remote-first setting, organizations have generally done an astonishingly bad job of bringing any intent at all to how they will build a culture that they care about. Forcing people to show up so they can hide behind a screen in the office is lazy.

Leading a project is about causing the death of a million ‘ands’.
There was a long line at the ice cream stand, but the person in front wasn’t budging. The customer had narrowed down the choice to four flavors, but they were paralyzed, unable to choose.
It’s not because any of the flavors wouldn’t be fine. They were all good choices. It’s because choosing one flavor meantnothaving the other three. Getting an ice cream had turned into a dance with regret.
You can’t build a luxury car that’s also inexpensive, AND drives well off-road, AND is very fast AND super safe. You can’t create an event that’s intimate, open to all comers, proven, resilient for any weather, held outdoors and unique.
We focus on the frustration of losing an ‘and’ when we get nervous about the decisions we’re asked to make, when we are hesitant about commitment. And we obsess over the constraints we’ve already accepted because it slows us down and amplifies our fears.
Instead of focusing on what we’re building, we focus on the paths that are no longer open.
If we’re going to create anything at all, if we’re going to ship the work, the positive path is to look for the constraints and grab them. They’re the point. No constraints, no project. When we see them as stepping stones on the way to the work we hope to do, they’re not a problem, they’re a sign that we’re onto something.

When there’s a line out the door. When there’s a buzz in the room. When people are talking about the work you’re doing. At least some of the people.

The likable brand (or person),"Likability is a weird quality. Plenty of people are fans of Aretha Franklin or Bob Dylan, but it’s not because either of them spent a lot of time mailing out Christmas cards or being particularly warm to their fans.
Google doesn’t do tech support and plenty of popular high-end restaurants got that way by being difficult to book and not particularly welcoming to new patrons.
One reason is that we’re drawn to status. To like something as a way of certifying our insight or rank.
But there’s a different path, one that’s far easier to maintain and travel. It’s simple: Like your customers and they’re more likely to like you back.
This is one reason that the Beatles switched their focus after their first US tour (and eventually stopped touring). They couldn’t figure out how to like the screaming young fans that didn’t have much in the way of discernment.

Detachment and commitment,"Working professionals develop emotional detachment. It’s the only way to thrive in the work. Emotional detachment helps us remember that we are not our work, and that feedback is useful, not an attack.
Commitment permits us to keep going (especially when we’re asked to provide more effort than we planned).
It’s easy to confuse the two.
Being detached doesn’t mean you don’t care. It simply means you’re focusing on the work and those you serve, not on your own narrative.
And being committed comes from a professional decision, not from an existential crisis.

Unemployment is debilitating and a real problem, but even high unemployment in many countries still means that most people have a job. Many times, it’s a job that didn’t exist before they had it.
Jobs exist because people are productive. When their productivity produces more value than the money they are paid, someone keeps the difference. Actually, two someones: The customer gets some of the benefit and the organizer of the job gets the rest.

Unless the person in the passenger seat has a telephoto lens on their phone, there’s no way in the world that this is going to work.
My late friend Jay Levinson said that the most effective billboard would say, “FREE COFFEE, NEXT EXIT.” A call to action, relevant to the viewer, easy to see and understand.
Actual billboards are a whole category of media, but now we’re surrounded by a new kind, a smaller, more evanescent and common one: Social media posts. You might see a thousand of these a day.
Social media began as text updates from one human to another, but thanks to photo sharing, some of the posts have become something else entirely. A chance to create consistent, actionable and clear reminders of what you are and what you stand for.
But keeping Jay’s edict in mind, they work best when they’re about the viewer as much as they are about you. They work better when they can be seen and understood from a distance. And they work better when they “sound like you.”
Here’s anexampleof a few dozen digital billboards that my fellow volunteers created for theAlmanac. These blew me away. Free coffee indeed.","July 17, 2022","billboards, social media, effective marketing"
The crossroads,"Which way to head?
We live in a world characterized by mistrust, ill health, economic uncertainty, inflicted racial trauma, generational shift and the existential crisis caused by carbon. Not to mention the stress and dissolution of traditional pillars like organized education, office space and live gatherings.
And we live in a world with breathtaking medical technology, artificial intelligence, widespread and rapid cultural coordination, efficient farming, a move away from greed and the beginning of green tech. As well as self-driven learning, diverse cultural projects and the long tail.
Now more than ever, there’s room for leaders. Go first.","July 16, 2022","leadership, societal challenges, technological advancement"
The correlation,"There might be a 100% correlation between what you do and what you get and what you want (if you’re trying to train for the hundred-meter dash.)
Anything that makes you go faster is correlated with the goal, which is winning the race.
On the other hand, being funny isn’t always correlated with being a rich and famous comedian. Being the funniest is not the same in comedy as being the fastest is in sprinting.
And most of what we spend our time on is closer to comedy than it is to sprinting. The things we believe are important, useful or moral are not always related to the metrics that the marketplace focuses on.
That’s partly because we’re not being compared using something as simple as a stopwatch. And it’s because what other people seek out might not match what we think is the point of the work.
It’s important to figure out whether the thing you want to accomplish is correlated with the performance that some imagine it might be.
For a lot of us, that’s more difficult than it sounds.","July 15, 2022","correlation, performance, goals"
Who will you share it with?,"Books used to be a solitary endeavor.
Ironically, it took the network effect and noise of the web to flip that idea upside down.
Now, a book is a totem, a chance to share, an item to be discussed, a physical instantiation of an idea that can be drawn on, exchanged or simply sit on your desk.
On Saturday, in dozens of countries around the world, the volunteers behind theCarbon Almanacwill be holding book signings to celebrate the launch of this project. I’ll be doing three, and I hope you’ll stop by and say hello if you can. (Details and venues are here). It’s a world record signing because it’s the only world we’ve got–and we are all authors of our future.
Why a book and not a website?
Because the book is complete, coherent and represents a moment in time. Because a book can create a conversation and an event. Because we hope you’llbuy three.
Why three?
Because when you hand someone a book that they might not have thought to buy on their own, you can talk about it.
And that’s what’s missing in this urgent but largely ignored moment.
The conversation.
The peer-to-peer interactions that help us make up our minds and then take action.
You know someone who needs to understand what’s happening, because they care enough about our future that they’d actually like to know.
Get them a copy. Hold your own signing. Talk about it and then see the systems that are changing our world. We need to start now. We are all authors of our future. And doing nothing is a choice, but one that we’ll regret.
The book is already a #1 bestseller in Italy and the United States and available in the Netherlands as well. Thank you for supporting it.

Intentional design (and complicated systems),"Intentional design is the most productive kind. It begins with “who’s it for?” and “what’s it for?” as foundational questions.
Along the way, complicated systems muddy design because there are so many “who”s to answer to.
Take this simple product found at a Hilton hotel, designed and sold by a division of Sysco, the giant food service company. It’s a little bigger than your thumb…
Well, if the “what’s it for” is to use in the shower, and the “who’s it for” is the hotel guest, it fails in countless ways.
It’s almost impossible to read (white type on a clear background). If you’re wearing glasses, or there’s steam, or you need glasses, then it is impossible to read.
It’s almost impossible to open as well. The diameter of the top is too small for most people to get a good grip on, particularly when used as intended–while in the shower. It turns out that the top doesn’t even screw off, there’s a tiny sharp lip that has to be popped up.
And now we get to the system problems.
The user didn’t purchase this. A well-meaning bureaucrat at Hilton worked with a well-meaning salesperson at a Sysco company to make the transaction happen. Both of them were trying to please their bosses. This might be as simple as, “buy something cheap,” but it could also have to do with favors owed, financing options or the convenience of delivery.
But wait, it gets worse.
When this container is used just one time, it’s discarded. It’s almost certainly put in an incinerator and burned for electricity or simply thrown into a landfill, where it will remain for a million years. The bottle is not only made of plastic, it’s at least five times thicker and heavier than it needs to be to do its job.
It’s not a refillable pump that is affixed to the wall and lasts for four years. It’s a disposable jar that uses almost as much energy to produce and lasts for one day.
The end result is hundreds of thousands or millions of these bottles, poisoning our world, simply because one designer asked the wrong questions.
This is the reasonThe Carbon Almanacneeds to be part of the conversation at ordinary companies like Hilton, for typical employees like the hard-working person who is the customer of the hard-working person who designed the bottle in the first place. Because one person designed one item that ended up being reproduced a million times, frustrating hundreds of thousands of wet people in hundreds of thousands of showers and then producing countless pounds of toxic carbon released into the air.
Nobody wins when this happens. It wastes time and money and goodwill. All because the system isn’t clear about who it’s for and what it’s for.","July 13, 2022","Intentional design, complicated systems, sustainability"
It’s easier when you know,"Someone is going to ask you. They probably already have.
A co-worker, a boss, a politician, a kid… they’ll ask you about sustainability, the climate, investments, choices to be made about the future.
Thisis the Cliff’s Notes and guidebook for that moment.
We make choices every day. Choices about what to buy, whether to recycle something, what to drive, who to vote for, how to produce and whether to go for more or for less. We make choices about the future, often with considerable consequences.
But we’re confused. Often deliberately, by forces that would rather we didn’t make up our own minds, who prefer that we don’t learn what need to learn. And sometimes we’re confused simply as a side effect of a complicated situation made even more complicated by a flurry of charts, graphs and opinions.
We need to make up our own minds.
Over the last 9 months, I’ve learned an enormous amount. Changed my mind about things I was sure were true. I’ve discovered thoughtful analysis and significant falsehoods. When I volunteered to help organize theCarbon Almanac, I didn’t know that thousands of people in more than 90 countries would volunteer to join the process, and I’m so glad they did.
And today’s the day the book arrives in the US and Canada, with worldwide editions coming soon. (I’d avoid the audio edition, as it’s really designed to be a browsable, shareable almanac.)
We have two slogans:
Don’t take our word for itandIt’s not too late.
You’re already being asked to decide. Knowing what’s going on and being able to look up authoritative data gives you the chance to make up your own mind. There are more than 1,000sources, all online, all organized in the Almanac. Isn’t it better to know?
And it isn’t too late to make an impact. But we need to begin. We need to see the systems and make a decision about whether they’re the systems we want to hand off to our kids.
I’m grateful to every person who contributed to this all-volunteer effort, and to you, for caring enough to learn about what’s happening. I hope you’llget a few copies, share them and join with people around the world to learn what’s happening.
Thank you.

"“Knock, knock”","The purpose of most communication isn’t to completely explain yourself. Too often, we get stuck relieving tension, making our case and closing the door on the discussion.

Best [insert] ever,"This is a trap worth avoiding.
When we examine our life experiences, the ones that stand out are usually about change. Either we were changed or we helped someone else get to where they sought to go.
And change is fleeting. And change changes us. We can’t step in the same river twice, because the second time, the river itself has changed.
The pressure we put on ourselves for every project to be “the best ever” experience creates a shallow race for bling instead of a deeper, more useful focus on what’s actually possible.
Seeking to rank our experiences takes us out of the moment. It turns us into sportscasters, spectators and statisticians. We end up comparing our wedding or our box office numbers or our tweet stats not only to our own best ever, but to the stats of others.
This summer is unlikely to be your best summer ever. But it will be a summer, and it’s up to each of us to decide what to do with it.

Office gossip,"Humans gossipped before we figured out fire, housing or farming. It’s built into our culture and possibly our DNA.
Gossip informs culture and can influence connection and hierarchies. And in many communities, it’s destructive.
If office gossip is benefitting you and the people you work with, good for you. But if office gossip is leading to stress, turnover or low satisfaction, it might be time to do something about it.
Two suggestions:
The first is a simple boundary.Don’t talk about anyone on the team unless they’re in the room.
This is simple to say and surprisingly difficult to do. Talking about people behind their back is built into the practice of management. It’s also the main sport of the water cooler and the fuel for gossip.
One boss meets with another boss to talk about an employee. And now there’s a reason to gossip and wonder.
With Zoom calls transcending space and time, there’s no longer a logistical reason to leave someone out. And you can adopt the posture that if it’s worth talking about someone, it’s worth including the person being talked about.
Once this becomes your practice, it gets more difficult to speculate about what was said, because nothing was said.
The second, which can’t work until you’ve consistently done the first, is to challenge office gossip at every turn. Thriving DM traffic on your Slack, cliques in the lunchroom–these undermine the organization you’re building. You wouldn’t tolerate people stealing petty cash or telling off your customers… the culture becomes what you tolerate.
Gossip won’t disappear. It can’t. But making it clear to the high performers that things aren’t like that around here–and meaning it–sends a message about the focus and culture of the team you’re working so hard to build.","July 8, 2022","Office gossip, workplace culture, communication boundaries"
The practice effect,"There are two kinds of skills, resources and tools:
Ones that get used up as you use them.
And ones that get better when you do.
Nobody wants there to be a crowd at the ski area on a bluebird powder day–too many people use up the new snow.
On the other hand, it’s no fun at all to go dancing when you’re the only one in the club.
A painting or a song that’s experienced by more people is worth more. A carpenter increases her skills when she works on new projects (to a point). On the other hand, a sharp knife gets dull if you use it too often…
If you’ve got something that benefits from use, from practice and community, use it and share it.","July 7, 2022","practice effect, skills, community"
“Do you have a plan?”,"First, let’s agree that there’s a problem.
It may be that I think we’re facing something serious, something costly, something urgent–and you don’t.
We can have an honest conversation about the problem without worrying about whether there’s an easy or certain solution.
We can also have a conversation about whether it’s a problem (problems have solutions) or whether it’s simply a situation, something like gravity that we have to live with.
Once we agree that we have a problem, the status quo will show up. It will argue with every tool it has that any variation from the current path is too risky, too expensive and too painful to consider. The status quo will stall. It will argue for studies and will amplify the pain that will be caused to some as we try to make things better for everyone.
And the status quo usually wins. That’s because the makers of change are now playing defense, forced to justify every choice and ameliorate every inconvenience.
Perhaps there’s a more useful way forward.
We begin by agreeing that there’s a problem.
And then each party, every single one, needs to put forward a plan. A plan that either addresses the problem or takes responsibility for not addressing it.
And for each plan, we can consider the likely outcomes. For each plan, we can ask, “will that work?” and follow it up with, “why?” and “how?”
Perhaps you don’t think it’s a problem worth solving. That’s important to bring up before we ask you if you have a plan.
Delay might be the best option. But then let’s be honest and announce that instead of simply stalling.","July 6, 2022","Problem, Status Quo, Planning"
Significant hurdles,"If your plan, your idea or your art doesn’t involve any significant hurdles in moving forward, it’s probably not worth that much.
If it were easy, everyone would do it.
The tactic is to seek a path where you see and understand the significant hurdles that kept others away. And then dance with them.

Two kinds of good cooks,"One is very skilled at following the recipe. Quality control, consistency and diligence.

Unbeatable vs perfect,"Google haskilledmore than 200 projects over the last few decades. They fail all the time. More than once a month they shut down a business that frightened the competition and seduced consumers.

“How can I help?”,"It’s a simple question that can open doors. But it also creates tension.
The person you’re seeking to connect with might not want to believe that help is possible. There’s a solace that comes from being really and truly stuck, and hope might not be on their agenda.
Or there might be resistance to thinking about what help would look like. Because visualizing it brings it one step closer to happening, and that can be scary.
Perhaps the person has danced with hope before, and discovered that people who mean well don’t always follow through. It may be that an offer of help feels temporary and selfish, not generous.
And it could be that the problem the person has built is so perfect and permanent that no help is possible.
Ultimately, the only way to know if help is possible is to try.","August 29, 2022","help, resistance, hope"
"Unprepared, as always","Technological leaps always take us by surprise.
What happens when every visual image ever created can be remixed and expanded?
Van Gogh,Superman, orMoses. These link to an open search engine, so your mileage may vary.
New software allows anyone to create images simply by typing in a dozen or so words. And software can already write blog posts or ad copy, and will soon do photorealistic animation.
If you’re a creator, you either have a style or you don’t. If you don’t, you’re simply a gig worker. And if you have a style, there’s a computerprogramthat’s going to not only encourage people to copy your style, but expand it. (Here’s a freebeta).

Revisionism,"There are two marketing problems when it comes to creating interventions for the public good.
The first marketing problem is that when it works we take the intervention for granted. The world doesn’t fall apart, and we don’t notice, because our expectation was that the world (whatever world matters to you) should stay on course. The intervention might have made a huge difference, but we don’t notice the persistence of good things.
The second marketing problem is that if an intervention doesn’t work as well as we expected, we rarely acknowledge it would have been even worse if we hadn’t done anything.
Banning cigarettes in bars saved thousands of lives. Car safety standards have saved more than a million. The ozone layer is in better shape than it would have been, and cars seem to run fine on unleaded gas and even electricity.
And yet there are revisionists writing books claiming that Ralph Nader destroyed the car industry, that Joe McCarthy was a good guy and that we don’t need to make sure that voting rights are preserved. Not all interventions work, but the ones that do are often hard to notice.","August 27, 2022","Interventions, Revisionism, Public Good"
“A good study”,"The gatekeepers keep disappearing.
When it cost $500,000 to produce a record album, you could assume that it was going to reach some people and not be completely amateurish. Today, many songs in the iTunes store have had exactly one listen.
When it cost $5,000,000 to make a video or a film, there was a lot of pressure to improve watchability and get an audience. Today, YouTube is filled with videos with no views at all.
And books from major publishing houses used to be assured of at least 20,000 copies in print and perhaps would find some loyal readers. Today, when anyone can write and publish an ebook, there are many that have fewer than ten sales.
While this open marketplace of creativity led to some broken hearts among creators, it also opened the doors for new ideas, new voices and a path to making it as a creative person.
Which brings us to scientific studies.
To get tenure, to spread an important idea, to gain status with colleagues, a scientific paper needed to be published in one of the dozens of journals that existed for this purpose. While there were some studies that were sloppy or even fraudulent, most peer-reviewed journal articles were probably worth taking seriously, with further inquiry appropriate when something important was at stake.
Today, 87.4% of the self-published and popular science articles available contain stats that are made up and methods that can’t hold up to scrutiny. They know that few people will bother to read the footnotes.*
If the goals are speed and clicks, it’s hard to also create a study that’s truly meaningful. Anyone with access to a dozen undergraduate students can publish a ‘breakthrough’ on behavioral economics or even epidemiology. If it gets read, it must be true.
Not so.
Before you get in a cryogenic chamber to help with your eczema, drink ionized water, or take a pill because you saw it mentioned on an opinion-focused cable show, it’s worth thinking hard about what it means for there to be a good study. Did they show their work? Have reputable peers referred to the study? What does the person publishing the study have to gain?
It’s interesting to note that there are very few breakthrough studies in areas like aerodynamics, perpetual motion and bridge design. That’s because it’s really easy to tell when they’re simply making stuff up.
Sometimes, the gates need keeping.

And when we disagree…,"The hallmark of a resilient, productive and sustainable culture is that disagreements aren’t risky.
When someone cares enough to make an assertion and show their work, a healthy organization or society takes a look.
The alternative is the brittle, closed culture of talking points, loyalty oaths and unquestioned status quo. It might be a neighborhood social club, a large corporation or a nation, but the principle remains.

The romance author might imagine that the other romance authors are competing for shelf space and sales.
I could give the cold shoulder to Simon or Brene or Pema instead of connecting with them.
But the pie can get bigger.
The competition lies in two areas:
• Big companies and systems.
• Apathy.
Years ago, when the leading providers of AOL got together at an annual conference and compared notes, we all ended up earning more in our next contract negotiations. Not to set prices, but to learn.
When small suppliers share information and insight, they find ways to not only decrease costs, but have more leverage with the bureaucracies they have to wrestle with. That’s a key function of agents–they spread information among disparate suppliers.
And when speakers or authors or musicians work together, they start to chip away at apathy, bringingenergyto the parts of the population that didn’t use to care or pay attention.
It’s not okay for Wal-Mart and Target to have secret meetings. But it’s totally appropriate for the little companies they work with to figure out how to band together to be treated more fairly and to increase demand for their category.

Five true statements we don’t hear very often,"It’s a shame, because it would help us do a much better job of bringing ideas to people:
“I don’t care enough to do what you’re asking.”
“I don’t trust you enough to hear you out.”
“I don’t believe it’s worth what it will cost in time, money or risk.”
“I’m afraid of the changes it will cause.”
“I don’t believe that I’m the kind of person who can do this.”
Instead, people talk about features, quality or budgets. Which might be genuine inquiry, but is often simply a way of stalling until time runs out.

Just that one scarce resource,"Growing our impact or profit usually involves maximizing something that’s valuable. And things that are valuable are often scarce.
Finding the one thing that is at the heart of your value/scarcity matrix makes it much easier to focus your energy on strategic decisions.
If you own a single store, you need to maximize the profit per square foot. Everything in your growth journey revolves around this.
On the other hand, Subway didn’t care about that at all, and instead focused on having as many sandwich franchises as they could. The resource they scaled was their franchise model.
If you own a factory, the slowest, busiest part of your assembly line is the critical path that has to be identified and optimized.
If you are a music teacher with 30 hours to spend with students a week, your growth is going to be about using each of those hours to maximum effectiveness (perhaps with more engaged students, or in developing digital assets or investing those 30 hours more carefully or profitably).
If you have a brand that consumers trust, you might be able to scale it by offering other products with that same brand name.
If you have a strong relationship with Target or Wal-Mart, you can scale that by bringing in new varieties to gain more shelf space. That’s why successful record labels got more successful by signing more artists. Studio time is easy to scale, access to DJs and rack jobbers, not so much.
If you have a permission relationship with 1,000 great customers, you can maximize the value (to them and to you) of each interaction you have.

When they don’t know what they’re talking about…,"People tend to do one of two things:
Both are a problem.
If we’re facing an important issue at work, at school or in our community, our instinct is to let others who are better informed speak up. Which prevents people from voting on a school budget or even volunteering to speak in class. We need their input and their solutions, but without insight and understanding, folks understandably hold back.
At the same time, alas, it’s apparently becoming a badge of honor to speak up (loudly and often) when one has no knowledge, has done no homework and has no insight. That’s not helpful, but there it is.
The all-volunteerCarbon Almanacis a #1 bestseller precisely because it gives people a chance to know what they’re talking about. It’s an almanac, with more than 1,000 sources, so you can look up anything that seems surprising.
And because it’s inexpensive and easy to share, you can give one to someone who will benefit from it even more than you.
It’s helpful to know. And it’s helpful to talk about what you know. That’s how we make things better.","August 18, 2022","knowledge, communication, engagement"
More than your share,"The math is simple: many people do less than they should.
They might be selfish, but it’s likely that they’re struggling with a lack of resources or a story of insufficiency. Either way, in any community or organization, many people contribute less than their peers.
Whether it’s splitting a check, getting a project done or making an impact on the culture or a cause, if you want things to get better, the only way is to be prepared to domorethan your fair share.
Because we need to make up for the folks who don’t.","August 17, 2022","contribution, community, responsibility"
Finding persistent invisible systems,"Plastic was inevitable.
It took hundreds of years to perfect, but we built a system based on profit, convenience, productivity and markets.
Markets are extremely good at sniffing out problems that can be solved with transactions. If people care enough to buy something to fill a need, someone else is likely to try to make that thing.
Along the way, this market-need sensing mechanism leads to factories, to retailers and to marketing. No one is in charge, no one stays on top forever, and the outputs of the system keep shifting–more of what the capital markets, parts of the labor market and most of all, the consumer market demands.
And so plastic is inevitable.
It makes it easy to manufacture and ship some things. It can increase productivity. It can lower costs. It makes the retail process more convenient–and consumers love convenience.
Last year, earthlings manufactured and used a trillion plastic bags. The manufacturer and disposal of plastic has an enormous cost to people and the places we live.
But plastic persists as a commercial solution, because the system is invisible and resilient. Each member of the system does what they do, usually for good reasons.
Gaiam makes yoga mats and blocks. It’s run by people who care about their impact on things, and their customers are environmentally aware. Yoga blocks are made of semi-hard foam, but they last a long time, and most of their customers are okay with that tradeoff.
But these blocks are then shrink-wrapped in plastic. And then the plastic shrink-wrapped foam blocks are wrapped in a relatively thick plastic marketing band to make them easier to display at the store. And then, if you buy the blocks from Amazon, the shrink-wrapped, belly-banded blocks are put in a plastic bag before being shipped to you.
Gaiam says that they’d rather not do this, but the retailers they depend on require them to. And the retailers say that they’d rather not require this, but it would increase prices (and perhaps decrease sales) if they had to rely on store personnel to hand-sell them. And Amazon uses a stopwatch and a spreadsheet to figure out what’s cheaper and faster…
And so, a system.
Plastic is just one example. Industrial and cultural systems are all around us, with all participants doing what they’re encouraged to do and furthering the work of the system.
Systems almost never change voluntarily. They rarely change because some of the participants in the system decide that they would prefer new rules. Systems change when their inputs change and when the rules change.
In this example, the moment we charge an appropriate price for plastic, incorporating the significant costs of disposal and climate change, the system will notice and act appropriately.
Every system we live with has already been altered by the needs of some of the people impacted by the system. As impacts grow, the number of people affected grows as well.

Expectation and delight,"They dance with each other.
If expectations are too low, you don’t get the gig, and you’ll never have a chance to engage with a customer.
But if they’re too high, surprise and remarkability disappear.
As you succeed, it’s harder, not easier, to bring delight to the people you serve.
Often, this is replaced by the cognitive dissonance of sunk costs and luxury goods. People assert delight because they think they’re supposed to, because they don’t want to feel stupid–not because you’ve produced anything genuine.","August 15, 2022","expectations, delight, engagement"

Synchronization can be distracting,"BothThe Shawshank RedemptionandThe Big Lebowskibombed. If “bombed” means that during the first few weeks, no one went to a theater to see them. Since then, tens of millions of people have seen and talked about these movies.
Tommy James’ first record also failed, because no one played it on the radio for months. And then, one party promoter in Pennsylvania started playing it a lot, and it became a hit. He went on to make seven top 10 hits.
We are primed to pay attention to things that happen in a thunderclap.
But the events that change our culture often happen over time, distributed across parts of the population too small to notice.
The Grateful Dead were the #1 live touring band more years than any other… and yet they only had one top 40 hit. Connection was worth more than wide and shallow sync.
The first challenge is finding the focus and patience to work on the asynchronized adoption of important ideas. And the second is to not sacrifice the larger goal in a frenzied hustle for the big break.

Naysayers (and the grifters),"Oppositional energy is easy to create and spread. Once you pick a ‘they’, then it’s simply a matter of doing the opposite of whatever ‘they’ recommend. It’s a lazy shortcut, one that divides, demonizes and causes us to suspend our instincts toward better.
It works great in marketing a sports team, but it stops being helpful in most other arenas.
Oppositional division is a magnet for grifters. A con-man, hustler, swindler or charlatan that can’t possibly do well with thoughtful scrutiny discovers that trolling and arguing is an easy way to bypass the normal examination of what’s actually on offer.
It’s not just the patent medicine door-to-door salesperson who does this. It’s large trade associations, industrial lobbyists, pyramid schemers, technobabblers and others as well.
Sooner or later, someone points out that there’s a grift going on. Hopefully, we see it before it’s too late.","August 12, 2022","Naysayers, Grifters, Oppositional Energy"
The wisdom of the water tower,"Look around the rooftops of many cities and you’ll see wooden water towers. New York has thousands of them.
The reason is simple and often overlooked:
In the morning, when every resident of the building is preparing for the day, there’s a need for thousands of gallons of water under high pressure. Providing that much power via a pump is expensive, noisy and difficult to maintain.
The system in use, on the other hand, takes two or three hours to refill the tank, using reliable, quiet and cheap small pumps. After that, gravity is all that’s needed.
Adding a reservoir to a high-demand system creates slack, resilience and efficiency.
Too often, foolish short-term profit seekers forget this, and use up what’s in the reservoir without keeping future reserves in mind.","August 11, 2022","water towers, efficiency, resilience"

It doesn’t matter that this illness isn’t going to be life or death in the next few days. For this patient, it feels that way.

Crickets,"When we sing in the shower, we hardly expect applause. In fact, that would be awfully weird.
But online, when just about anyone might be clicking, watching or sharing, it’s disappointing to put your work into the world and hear nothing.
Nothing but a black hole that absorbs your best work and reflects nothing back.
And if that happens again and again, it can become overwhelming.
It’s tempting to dumb down your work, or go for a shortcut or a quick hit.
Worst of all, to simply give up.

The key word isempathy. While of course, you’re welcome to make work for just yourself, the path forward lies in figuring who it’s for and the change you seek to make. To go where others are instead of requiring them to put in the effort to figure out what you’re up to.

What to count,"So many choices. So many sorts of metrics, critics and measures.
Perhaps it makes sense to count things where the counting tells us how to do better next time.
And to count things that let us know how much risk we can take next time.
Or to calibrate our judgment about the market.
But it makes no sense at all to count things over which we have no control, and which teach us nothing about the future.

Time and focus and energy,"Sooner or later, they’re all finite. And the way we allocate our time and emotional energy determines what gets done.
If we audited your day in six-minute increments, what would we find?
By the clock, how did you actually spend the time given to you (we each get the same 24 hours). How much was spent on work? And the work time, how is it correlated with what creates the value you seek?
A question that’s harder to measure, but with far more impact, of the time you allocated, what was your focus and emotional drive spent on? What were the crises and highlights of the last day or week?
There’s generally a gulf between what wesaywe did all day and what we actually did. And there’s an even bigger chasm between the urgencies and emotional moments and the ones we know actually pay off.

Novelty vs action,"Nerds, geeks, early adopters: they do things because they’re fresh and new and might not work. They’re novel.
Most people, though, hesitate in the face of novelty. Because novelty is risky. Shoes with goldfish in the heels. The latest techno-ska-punk track. The new kind of phone…
The reason we haven’t taken systemic action is that it’s scary, not because it isn’t novel enough.

Extensions and souvenirs,"When a brand is successful, there’s often a desire to extend it.
Disneyland was an extension of Disney movies. It reflected some of the magic of the movies, but created something new and valuable as well. Disneyland had some of the Disney essence and then built something additive and new.
Apple did the same thing with the iPhone in extending the brand of the Mac.
On the other hand, the new Leica watch is simply a souvenir. It’s not a better watch. It’s not more of a Leica than any of a dozen other overpriced watches could be seen to be. It’s simply there to remind you that you liked the original. It’s a souvenir of a feeling, not the creator.
Nothing wrong with a souvenir. I’m sure Leica will make a profit from their watch with little damage to the promise that the brand itself makes. But make too many souvenirs and you become a hollow shell, wasting the chance to make the change you seek.
The crappy t-shirt you bought at your favorite musician’s concert is a souvenir, but they shouldn’t count on that as their legacy or the engine of their growth.
All day, individual creators have to make choices about what they’re going to do next. Sometimes we can create an extension. And sometimes, we decide to make a souvenir instead.","September 29, 2022","brand extension, souvenirs, creativity"
Logistics vs (and) innovation,"When innovation arrives, the logistics people have to scramble to keep up, because innovation always makes it hard to do things the way we used to.
Over time, an innovative company thrives if it can get its logistics in order. Ship the right stuff to the right people on time and on budget.
Once this happens, it often means that the logistics people gain in power and influence. After all, they pulled off a miracle.
Then, when the next innovation shows up, the logistics voices in the room are likely to have more say in what happens next. That’s why upstarts who feel like they have nothing to lose are so much more likely to innovate–they don’t realize how hard it is going to be.
Innovation doesn’t work without logistics.","September 28, 2022","Logistics, Innovation, Influence"
"Retribution, revenge, and especially, remorse","When an organization has caused harm (through error or intent), it’s tempting to be sure they learned a lesson. We want folks to take responsibility, to admit culpability and to be sure they won’t do it again.
But if you need those things to happen to make things better for all of us, we’re going to have to wait a long time.
Perhaps it makes sense to embrace, “now that I know what I know now, I can make a new decision based on new information and do this instead.”

But we don’t listen to the tracks in isolation, because the isolation isn’t the point.
Human beings care about harmonies. About originality. About the tension that comes from the new. And we care about the dynamics between and among people who are working together.

White glove service,"It’s not about the gloves.
The pointlessness of the white gloves is actually a big part of it.
Good service meets expectations. It is the fulfillment of a promise to the customer.
White glove service goes far beyond that. It is designed to surprise and delight. It creates a connection with the recipient that goes beyond a simple transaction, already paid for. It is a signal of care and respect, of gratitude and abundance.
As soon as we start to wonder if slightly smudged grey gloves are okay (“no one will notice,”) or look to others for what is acceptable, then we might as well simply do the minimum.
It’s possible your organization has just saved a ton of money by moving online–no longer paying rent, upkeep or overhead on a local sales facility. One way to replace this demonstration of stability and commitment is to invest in white glove service instead.

The chief hype officer,"The chief marketing officer at a big company has an impossible job. The typical duration of a CMO is 18 months because once the CEO realizes that hype for money can’t solve their problems, they get restless.
The problem lies in what people think “marketing” is.
Marketing isn’t paying for ads, changing the logo or building a social media presence.
Marketing is product design, customer service, pricing, customer delight and creating and living a remarkable story. Marketing is creating the conditions for the network effect.
And yet, the typical CMO isn’t in charge of ANY of those things.
No wonder it’s frustrating. You thought you were getting a marketer, but all you did was hire someone to make a commotion on social media.
The words matter. If you are hiring someone to be in charge of promotion, say so. But if you want someone to be in charge of marketing, have them be in charge of all of it. If it touches the market, it’s marketing.","September 23, 2022","CMO, marketing, brand strategy"
The beef tax,"We’re all paying it, every day.
In the US, taxpayers subsidize the cattle industry with billions of dollars of tax money each year. Most of that goes to pay for feed crops, but there is also a huge allocation of public land for the grazing of cows. About half the land in the entire country is just for cattle.
In addition, a significant portion of the climate problem is directly caused by the effects of bovine respiration as well as the clear-cutting of forests for grazing worldwide. It’s like someone is dumping manure on your living room carpet and asking you to pay for it.
The end result is that whether or not you eat meat, you’re paying for it.
Beef is more expensive than we realize. And it’s also significantly less convenient than we give it credit for. Climate refugees, storm-damaged assets, the loss of life and homes… these are directly caused by the one billion cows that humans raise each year.
What would happen if we simply charged a fair price for the beef and milk that people consume?
The industry has done a great job of persuading people that beef is cheap, convenient, easy, luxurious, wholesome and benign. It’s none of those things.
I wonder how long it will take us to realize just how much it costs us.","September 22, 2022","beef tax, cattle industry, environmental impact"
Is there a word for that?,"Experts have a word for it. If it’s important, conceptual or frequently discussed, there’s probably a domain-based word that experts understand. The precision of a special vocabulary allows them to do better work.
But…
Just because someone knows the word for it doesn’t mean that they understand, or that they’re a useful expert.

Not that good for who?
If you mean to say, “I don’t like it, it doesn’t appeal to me,” then that’s what you should say.
If, on the other hand, you have enough expertise and domain knowledge to say, “I understand what has appealed to the audience you’re trying to serve, and this isn’t going to work.”

Easy in/Easy out,"The law is simple to describe, fair and useful: It should be as easy to unsubscribe from an online service as it is to sign up.
Other than powerful brand bullies, who is against this?
It took me five minutes to sign up for a data connection for my car a few years ago. Yesterday, after selling the car, it took me more than three hours to get AT&T to stop charging me for the service. Went to the store, they won’t do it. Went to their website, they won’t do it. Went to online chat, half an hour later, discovered they won’t do it (I have the transcript if Kellyn Smith Kenny wants to see it). I called, waited on hold for half an hour, was disconnected, you get the idea…)
Yes, this is bad marketing by AT&T. It’s unlikely that making it inconvenient to turn off service for a car you no longer own is going to dissuade someone from doing it. It hurts their brand, demotivates the employees and destroys loyalty. It’s short term-thinking by a lazy brand manager.
But they do it anyway.
When organizations get too big and too short-term focused to pay attention to the market, it’s a perfect moment for consumers to band together and give them a guardrail.
If I can sign up with a few clicks, I should be able to unsign up with a few clicks.","September 19, 2022","unsubscribe, consumer rights, brand loyalty"
The last 1%,"If you apply for something with a 99% rejection rate (which is more common than it sounds–job openings, sales pitches, fellowships, journals, etc.) that’s pretty close to 100%. Something with a 99% certainty is generally considered a sure thing.
Hence thisJournal, which promises to reject every single person who submits an article.
The absurdity of it is the point. Submitting to them feels effortless and without a lot of drama, because you know you’re going to get rejected. So instead of becoming attached to the outcome, you can simply focus on the work.

Either you’re asserting that doing those things is the way to maximize your profit…
Or you’re committing to not maximizing your profit, as your purpose is more human and connected than something that simple.
If it’s the latter, if you’ve decided that making just enough profit to maximize your real goal is the purpose of the organization, what an extraordinary opportunity. Organizations of humans with a clear measured goal and just enough profit to get there can make a huge impact.

The grassroots,"Starting at the top seems like great advice. Deal with the people with power and authority.
Except…
Power and authority aren’t often in the same place.
The real power is usually foundational. What happens when humans interact. The way things are around here. Often, the people who are ostensibly in charge are simply choosing from a few culturally acceptable choices, and those choices are dictated by the foundation.

Feature creep,"This isn’t just software. It’s the menu at the diner. It’s the buttons on the dashboard of a car. It’s the variety of choices parents are offered of which dates summer camp starts or ends. Anything where a lot of hard work can be slightly improved simply by adding an innocuous option.
At one point, Yahoo had 183 links on their home page. Google, which had two, ultimately grabbed all of their search traffic. The app on my phone can now open the trunk of my car if I press enough buttons.
Features are useful (that’s why we call them features). And yes, serving the underserved and the unseen is important. But creep cannot continue forever. At some point, there’s system bankruptcy and the cycle begins again.

What does it mean to be smart?,"You probably know that Bruce Wayne is actually Batman. That’s a secret identity that most of us are aware of.
And if you’re up on pop culture, you know that the best Batman was played by the late actor Adam West.
Visit the visual search engineLexica, though, and you’ll see that it knows that Adam West was Batman. A search for “Adam West” (with no mention of roles, DC comics or secret identities), shows us this:
It’s important to note that none of these are pictures of Adam West, in or out of costume. It simply “knows” that Adam West is Bruce Wayne is Batman, and shows us some reconstructed images of Batman from the 1960s. It also knows that we might be looking for Batman, even though it’s a secret. The new algorithm it’s using is more than twice as good at figuring out what a picture is a picture of.
When a human does something mysterious like this sort of leap, we simply call them smart. It’s a simple way to describe something we don’t understand. Complexity and breadth mixing in mysterious ways.

Fake-aceuticals,"Of course, we’ve always had snake oil salesmen. We’ve always had patent medicines, odd electric probes and copper bracelets. That’s partly becauseplaceboswork, and partly because when someone isn’t feeling well, it’s tempting to seek relief and belief.
In the last fifty years, peer-reviewed and tested medicine has gotten dramatically more effective at the same time that these regulated medicines have spent a fortune on ads and marketing. As a result, the sham snake oil purveyors have worked hard to copy the scientific umbra and language of tested and regulated treatments. And thanks to aggressive lobbying, in many countries, the folk remedies are nearly unregulated.
So we’ve got greedy public pharma companies, with a tested product and an ad budget that often exceeds their R&D budget (industry wide, itapproacheshalf of R&D). They’re using every tool they can to sell something expensive that sometimes works. And then we have folk medicine companies that are responding to the high prices and ad influx by raising their own prices and sharpening their own ads, blurring the gap and grabbing some of the trust that people have in verified and tested results.
Belief is useful and placebos work. But you can see the widening gap here. It’s hard to tell from the website or ad which are the actual focused, tested, double-blind and effective treatments, and which are simply scams. A cheap benign placebo is a bargain. One that costs too much or hurts you is not.
If someone tells you that they’re offering a diagnostic test of your micro-biome and has you send in a sample for scientific analysis and testing, it’s almost certain that they’re doing nothing of the sort. If there’s a simple device you can buy online for $100 or so, it is likely that it doesn’t cure pain the way they say it does. If a practitioner insists that they have powers that transcend the laws of physics or reason, they’re actually only offering you the power of suggestion. And yes, if a famous doctor insists that an expensive over-the-counter magical bean is what you need, think twice.
Regulated medicine has gotten dramatically more effective in the last few decades. Folk medicine hasn’t changed at all, even if it costs ten times more than it used to, and even if the packaging and hype is significantly more sophisticated.
And so: targeting people in distress, charging ever more and honing the sales pitch to make it ever sharper.
It’s a shame that the folks who do this don’t have the self-respect and generosity it would take to be honest about what they’re offering. Instead, they hide behind a facade of jargon and process that conceals the fact that they’re simply making it up. That oil isn’t essential, except in the way it makes a profit.

We don’t talk about all the time we waste in meetings, the persistence of caste and injustice, the manipulation of our communication platforms, the creeping aristocracy disguised as a meritocracy or even the ridiculous nature of the wedding-industrial complex.
What all of these systems have in common is that they maintain their position in the status quo by creating a force field that somehow keeps us from talking about them.
On the other hand, we talk about quarterly profits, sports rankings, celebrities and the horserace of the day’s politics all the time. Which is why so much time and energy is spent on polishing and optimizing those systems.
Figure out what’s important, then create the conditions for people to talk about it.

Constraints are a gift,"“If only” is a soothing refrain. If only the constraints were lifted, and the things that are scarce were abundant. If only the barriers were lifted and there was more time or fewer obstacles…
That’s a trap.
If the constraints went away, you’d be playing a totally different game, because your competitors would see their constraints lifted as well.
Constraints are a gift because they bring us something to lean against, and they give us the chance to focus on work we can actually do.
Every once in a while, the situation changes and constraints are lifted. In those moments, we need to be hyper-aware of the new possibilities. The rest of the time, instead of cursing the boundaries, we can celebrate them.","September 7, 2022","constraints, focus, opportunities"
The treatment of bystanders,"This seems to be cultural, not based on income, caste, race or genetics.
Some professions and communities give a greater percentage of their income tocharitythan others. Some towns have no-kill dog shelters while others have areputationfor abandonment. You might find an online community that welcomes and supports newcomers, and another that simply trolls and argues with them.
You can find a surf beach where the norm is to let others have the right of way and lend a hand, and others wheresurferswould rather go to jail than let you have a shot at a wave.
A sailboat is more respectful than a Jetski. It’s silent, picturesque and safer for those around it. Given the choice, some groups of people choose one, some the other. And while we can have productive conversations about what actually helps the most bystanders in the best possible way, it’s also pretty clear that some organizations and cultures are more aware of their impact than others.
Bystanders, by definition, can’t give you anything in return. Treating others with care and dignity isn’t a shortcut to a sale or profit, it’s simply something that gets done around here (or doesn’t.)
Part of our opportunity is to normalize the behaviors we’d like to be around.","September 6, 2022","bystanders, culture, community"
Getting the hull shape right,"It’s tempting to have your book copyedited and typeset before you have your editor read it.
And it feels right to spend time on the company’s website before you have your first customer…
But if you don’t have the foundational elements right, the fit and finish don’t matter at all.
This summer I designed and built a skin-on-frame canoe. I could have spent a lot more time on the details, the sanding and even putting on the gunwales. But it wouldn’t have mattered, because the boat’s design was so unstable and tippy, it was unusable.
All that remains of the boat is this picture and what I learned about hull design.

The speed of change,"Moore’s law talks about the fact that computer chips get faster and cheaper over time.
It turns out that the biggest shift to our culture isn’t the changing speed of a computer chip, it’s what happens when we network humans together.
Adding more people to the internet has accelerated science, politics and every element of culture. The echos happen faster, the learning is exponential, and connected communities heat up and morph ever faster.
Science used to be a solo endeavor. A monk with some pea plants could figure out genetics. Today, there are millions of people advancing the work of millions of people, with new updates coming all day long. The problems are dramatically more difficult, but the solutions are possible because we’ve multiplied the speed of change.
Thinking of problems as things for individuals to solve is hopelessly out of date.","September 4, 2022","1. Networking

Cultural distress (and consumerism),"For decades, marketers (and politicians) have been working to amplify cultural distress, a hack on our emotions.
Not the tragic emotional distress of being unable to care for your kids, find a place to live or deal with trauma, but the invented cultural distress of modern industrialized societies.
This is the easily created shame of not having a new suit to wear to the garden party, or having to use an old model smartphone instead of the new one. It’s the dissatisfaction of knowing that something ‘better’ is available, and the invented discontent that comes from the peer pressure of being left out or left behind.
Or it might be the social shame that comes from not having a big enough presence on social media, or the fomo that watching other people presenting nothing but happiness online can create.
It can be amplified with a sort of nostalgia for times when everything was perfect, or anxiety about a future when we imagine we won’t have enough.
Fear of this sort of cultural distress pushes us to simply spend money to avoid it. It’s easier to lose your life’s savings and peace of mind to end-of-life care than it is to simply draft a living will. It’s easier to give in to the high-pressure tactics of a real estate broker than it is to look squarely at the feelings that you might not actually get this particular house. Making a budget is hard, paying for not making one is easy.
It turns out that selling an easy and convenient way to avoid social pain is a nearly boundless formula for corporate growth. And so people with a lot of resources are still unhappy, because they succumb to invented narratives about cultural distress–and then, once they buy something to avoid it, discover that it’s still there.
Marathon runners don’t complain about the tired, because getting tired is a necessary component of a well-run race. And human beings are always going to find moments of cultural distress, and it’s up to each of us to decide what to trade (in the short run and the long run) to deal with it. Perhaps it makes sense simply to acknowledge that it’s present.","September 3, 2022","Cultural distress, Consumerism, Emotional manipulation"

Circus peanuts don’t contain nuts,"This is obvious. Circus peanuts don’t have nuts, legumes or anything else that resembles a nut.
They’re a metaphor. Or perhaps a simile, it depends on your level of pedantry.
And yet, many people have a hard time with metaphor. Metaphor, not memorization, is the heart of learning.
If you understand A, and you see that B is like A but a little different, now you understand B.
Memorization is brittle. Metaphor scales.
Metaphor helps us create the next thing and find our footing when confronted with the new.

The opportunity to be wrong,"History is filled with examples of people who made errors in judgment.
The executives at Decca that turned down the Beatles, the CEO at Digital who said that no one would ever need to have a computer in their home, and the reviewers that didn’t like the movie2001.
And of course, the creators that are wrong so often. The entrepreneur who raises a bunch of money and fails, or the musician who follows up a hit with a string of duds.
But these failures are all a sign that someone had been given the privilege to be wrong in the first place.
It’s tempting to find a sinecure where someone tells you what to do all day–after all, then you’re off the hook and you can’t be wrong, only the boss can.
But it’s far more thrilling and useful and fulfilling to be the one who might mess up.","October 30, 2022","opportunity, failure, judgment"
Sticking just the right amount,"There are unforeseen speedbumps, missed connections and of course, a lot of luck.
If you are in love with your authentic voice, you’re unlikely to change. One lesson from the500 Songspodcast is that most classic rock songs were made by people who started pretty far from where they ended up, but persisted, adjusted and changed until they created the hits they sought.
Not one of them sounded the way they thought they would when they started… the act of making a hit involved abandoning some of what they said they believed in. These hits weren’t ‘authentic’ or the work of native talent. They were evolved, tweaked and changed in response to feedback from the world.
Change too often and you stand for nothing. You’re simply chasing a shadow you will never catch.
Refuse to change and you’re likely to be overlooked.

"Handy, cheap and willing","The industrial age prized these three attributes. We’ve all been indoctrinated into adopting them through our time in organized schooling, and it’s easy to imagine that the world still wants this.
When work is geographically bounded and the assembly line is the dynamic of efficiency, this is precisely what’s sought. Your resume certifies that you have what it takes to check the boxes, and the hiring company adjusts its offered pay to get the folks it needs, when they need them.
But now the rules have changed, suddenly and perhaps for the long haul.
There are still companies, many of them, searching for HCW. But those aren’t jobs we actually want.
When your job is digital, when you can work from home, there is no such thing as “handy.” That means that the company is either going to hire the cheapest possible person out of perhaps a billion worldwide, or get a computer to do it, or…
Or they need to hire someonespecial.
Someone with significant skills.
They might be the traditional sort of skills. That you’re actually truly great at coding or design or engineering. You’ve done the reading, built a body of work and earned the respect of your peers. That you’re not saying, “you need anyone, and I’m anyone,” but instead, are demonstrably and substantially better at the craft.
Or they could be real skills, which some call soft skills. That you bring emotional labor, thoughtful analysis, care, humor, equanimity or other difficult human actions to the work. Significantly more than most people do. If you’re off the chart at this, it will be valued by the places you’d be happiest working.
The good news is that there’s a path. The hard part is digging in and becoming better than good.

With certainty,"A 98% chance is dramatically different than a 100% certainty.
Certainty isn’t on the spectrum of chance. It’s a different thing altogether. If the weather report says the chance of precipitation is zero, one should never walk outside into the rain.
When you leave yourself a few points of wiggle room, you can build more trust. Low chance of rain is fundamentally different than a slight chance of rain.
At the same time, if it actually is certain, say so.","October 27, 2022","certainty, chance, trust"
Giving it a second thought,"Some problems lend themselves to reexamination. A second, third or even fourth thought is productive, because our initial impulses might not reflect our best effort at understanding the nuances of the situation.
But many problems simply create more thoughts, without productive output. As we confront something that is unlikely to have a simple or productive way forward, it’s easy to go into a mental tizzy imagining solutions.
The art is understanding which sort of problem we’re facing. And devoting the right amount of thought (not less and definitely not more) to the situation we’re in. Spending cycles on categorizing the problem is probably more productive than wasting time on problems that don’t deserve our effort.","October 26, 2022","reexamination, problem-solving, productive thinking"

None of it matters if the people aren’t connected. So perhaps we ought to call it the first mile instead.
For the last year or so, volunteers around the world have been buildingThe Carbon Almanac. It has become a bestseller in each country it has appeared (including the US, UK, the Netherlands, Italy and now in Chinese) and there’s a wide range of free material to go with it.

Perfect might be the enemy of good in group dynamics and choice making,"When one person needs to fix a wall, adjust a cabinet or choose what to serve for dinner, they can optimize their choice. Make appropriate trade-offs. Take responsibility for the path chosen.
But when a group of people are asked to do the same thing, it’s easy to err on the side of the pursuit of perfect, or to choose to average things out.
And so the legal team weighs in, and consultants are hired. And so, “but what if?” is always considered, regardless of how rare that outcome might actually be. Entire industries are built around creating deniable, average products and services that are sure to delight no one, cost more than they might and insulate the committee from backlash.
When you find yourself creeping in this direction, it might be worth asking what the risk is of simply suspending the committee and putting someone in charge instead.",,"group dynamics, decision making, perfectionism"
How many good days?,"Decisions and crises and moments of significant effort and risk can be stressful.
But the challenge of a stressful day is rarely directly related to today, it’s about tomorrow or years from now.
Which means that pushing your way through some critical choices now will probably pay off in far more good days later. How many good days later does hard decision work today earn us?

Product idea: Talking discs,"Many offices and public settings are putting up clear plexiglas barriers to insulate staff from the spread of disease. While we can easily see through these partitions, it ends up creating a lot of yelling.
What if there were a disc, about the size of a hockey puck and the thickness of a few coasters… it would come in pairs, be low-powered and Bluetooth enabled. Stick one on one side of the glass, one on the other. It’s a microphone and a speaker… boom. At scale, they’d probably be really cheap.
One extension: allow the disc to also hook up to a wifi router or laptop. Now, you can have a disc at your home office and your colleague can have one too. Tap it to turn it on, and if the other person chooses to unmute, you can have a casual conversation the way we might in the old office-bound days.
It’s pretty easy to imagine creating a simple app that could record and create a transcript of every transaction, which could be useful for bureaucracies and public records.

Dawani’s Law,"“The number of people who say that Moore’s Law can’t continue doubles every 24 months.”
Even if you don’t understand this at first, it’s worth a second to understand it.
Moore’s Law, now nearly sixty years old, describes a simple engineering fact that has changed the life of everyone on the planet. The number of transistors that can be put on a chip doubles every two years.This doesn’t sound like much, but if you double even a number as small as 2 thirty times, it increases to more than a billion.
If the price of a house followed Moore’s Law, you could buy a mansion for a few pennies. Moore’s law describes the tech path that gives us artificial intelligence, smart phones and the internet.
And ever since he described the law, experts have been pointing out that it won’t continue, it can’t continue and we’ve exhausted any chance for more progress.
Like most things, it probably won’t go on forever. But that doesn’t mean it’s done.

Selling a company,"Cars aren’t like companies. Most cars on the road will be sold, again and again, until they end up as parts. Companies usually start and end with their founders.
Sometimes, a small, stable company is sold to an individual operator, usually for a multiple of the expected annual profit. It’s an investment in future cash flows, but it can be fraught, because, unlike a car, you can’t take a company for a test drive, and they usually need more than a periodic tune-up and charging station visit.
The market for used companies isn’t as efficient or reliable as the one for used cars, as surprising as that might sound. The individual who seeks to buy and operate a used company is rare, and doesn’t often have access to significant capital.
The company sales we hear about tend to be more strategic, where the buyer believes that the purchased company offers synergy (1 + 1 = 3) with their existing businesses. Perhaps the buyer has a salesforce, investment capital, systems or structures that make the combination of the companies far more successful than they would be alone.
One way to look at this is the think of the assets you’ve built. They could include:
More elusive than some of these are things like:
Some of these things can be predicted and patiently built. Others are easy to see after the fact, but they’re more opportunistic than intentional.
Perhaps the single best indicator of whether a company will be considered for a strategic acquisition is that it has investors and board members who have done this before. Because these acquisitions are rarely simply rational calculations on a spreadsheet, there is often a need for cultural fit and a shared reality distortion field to create the conditions for them to get put on the agenda.","October 17, 2022","company sales, strategic acquisition, investment cash flows"
“I’m not that smart”,"Someone said that to me the other day and it was heartbreaking.
The number of tasks in our culture that require someone who was born with off-the-charts talent is small indeed.
Just about everything else we need people to do is the result of effort, practice and care. It’s true that variations of that work are easier for some folks, but no one finds all of it easy going.
The correct thing to say is, “I don’t care that much.” I don’t care enough to do the reading, to fail along the way, to show up, to make a promise, to learn as I go, to confront failure, to get better at the work.

But it’s unlikely that it’s everyone’s favorite.
Being everyone’s favorite is such an attractive goal, and almost impossible to achieve.
Ask someone about their favorite pie and they’ll talk about the one they ate as a kid, or one that a grandparent bakes, or perhaps, one from the bakery down the street.
To collate all of these favorites into one singular popularity contest is unlikely to yield much success.
It might be America’s most convenient pie, or the bestselling one. It might be the best value or the easiest to obtain. But none of those things mean “favorite.”
Often, when we set out to do our work, we focus on popularity and breadth at the expense of the magic and singular experience that could create a favorite. Something we’d miss if it weren’t there.
I wonder if seeking to be someone’s favorite is more satisfying than trying to be popular to everyone.

The uncanny valley of scale,"Big companies act like big companies. We don’t take them seriously when they say they care, because there is no “they.” When they send a holiday card or an email, we don’t really think it was from a person we could connect with.
Individuals act like individuals. When they write us a note or show up in person, we know that we’re dealing with a human.
In between, though, problems arise.
Did your friend really write that tweet, or did the staff do it?
That email that you just got, BCC… when you hit reply, will it go to the person who purported to send it, or to a team, or the infinite void?
The voice in our head changes when the identity of the sender differs.
When individuals try to scale, they often think they can bring their care, personality and person-hood along for the ride. And inevitably, it ends up disappointing everyone.

The invisibility paradox,"The optic nerve dominates.
It’s piped directly into our brains and uses a lot of processing power to help us discern the world through vision.
As a result, it’s louder than our other senses and often outshouts the rest of our brain. That’s why it’s easy to be fooled by a magician.
This focus on sight means that we often are at a loss on how to deal with things that are invisible.
It works in our favor with the placebo effect. We can see that we just swallowed a pill, or wore a brace, or bought an expensive bottle of wine. That input helps us heal or enjoy the moment, even if the organic invisible things behind the scenes don’t quite match what we saw.
And it works against us when it’s time for our community to process things that are invisible over time (like evolution or systems change) or invisible in the moment (like viruses and greenhouse gasses).

Most people would not.
So why do we upgrade? Software, phones, cars, houses…
It’s because we’re not making that simple choice. Instead, we’re embracing the wisdom of the choice we made years ago at the same time we’re focusing on the glaring defects that status and affiliation relentlessly point out.

For the good of the community,"One way to serve the community is to see it as a market and solve one of its problems.
When people choose to buy something, it’s ostensibly because the thing you sell is worth more to them than it costs. And so value is created.
And when you make a profit selling something and pay taxes, those taxes go to create services for the community.
Those are two reasons culture has evolved to enable capitalism.
When this system gets out of whack, two things happen–first, some businesses use their market power to extract more value than they create. And second, they use their lobbying power to pay no taxes.

In a given situation, you might encounter one or the other type of response. In fact, each of us might adopt one posture or the other.

My pickup truck is faster than your Ferrari,"Culture shifts. But it’s held in place by norms, and those are driven by status and affiliation.
No one actually needs a car that can accelerate one second faster than most other cars. But having one confers status in some circles. But what happens when a new generation of technology makes that previously fast car not the fastest anymore? Is it still a luxury good?
Mink coats used to confer some sort of prestige in some circles. What happens when a Patagonia jacket is warmer, more durable, cheaper, lighter, less cruel and easier to wear?
A big steak dinner was a way to express generosity and hospitality. What happens when you live in a community where steak isn’t seen as generous any longer?
Perhaps a master of the universe can point out that he can be at the meeting tomorrow simply by hopping on his private jet. Is there more status in being the one who can save time and overhead simply by dropping in via Zoom?
A big office may no longer be more prestigious than a resilient, productive workforce that works where it wants to. A loud factory crammed with workers might not be the sign of power and influence that it used to be. Smokestacks used to show that a city was on the move…

But it’s far more likely that they’re simply winging it.
In the early stages of a campaign, winging it is a form ofpoking the box. A chance to try new approaches to see how the system responds.

Contracts and power,"A written contract benefits the party with the least power.
Power might be in the form of money, access to plenty of lawyers or simply a willingness to burn it all down to the ground.
In the moment before a contract is signed, the lower-powered party momentarily hasmorepower. That’s because the other entity wants what you have. But as soon as they have it, it’s only the contract that offers concrete protection against future events.
Handshake agreements are great when there’s an ongoing, stable interaction. As long as each side is honorable, the other party can continue to do what they said they were going to do. But when priorities or outside factors shift, an at-will arrangement can end up harming the person who can least afford it.
The two things to focus on are:
This is why adding a binding informal arbitration clause to a contract is a smart idea. Why it makes sense for there to be worker and other protections in the law. And why we need to reinforce and applaud judicial systems that enforce clearly defined agreements.","November 21, 2022","Contracts, Power Dynamics, Legal Protections"

Micropayments for content,"This is a problem that comes up every year or two, but no one has implemented a useful solution yet.
Advertising is a surprisingly bad way for a culture to pay for content, because the kind of content that gets rewarded is often dumbed down for a large audience or is optimized for a small audience of people eager to buy something that makes a profit.
It’s also inefficient, as advertisers can’t know in advance what’s going to work, and creators get a very small share of the ad spend.
An alternative is to pay for what you get, the way we treat carrots, baseballs and clarinets. Instead of buying a baseball, though, you’re buying a chance to watch avideo.
Micropayments are a system where you pay a penny or a nickel or a dollar for a piece of content.
It introduces two kinds of friction, though:
About thirty years ago, I described a simple solution to both problems:
For $25 you can buy a content passport. It’s available for purchase on any website that is part of the content network, and you need one to read the content on their site. The site that sells it to you gets $10 in commission for selling it to you.
It keeps track of every member site you visit (that’s really easy now, with a cookie). And then the coordinator of the system allocates, on a percentage basis, $10 to the sites you visit. It’s all gonna go somewhere, whether you visit one site or a thousand. There’s no friction, because it’s a buffet, just like it is now. Read all you want, no ads, no hassles.
The sites that get visited the most get the most aggregate money from the monthly distributions of royalties.
Each site has an incentive to sell a lot of passports (the commission is significant) and the coordinator of the network is making 25% as well.
It’s really clear who the customer is (the reader) and it’s easy for any site to join the network. Aligned incentives, a simple and resilient solution.
Have fun. (PS this is unrelated to yesterday’s post about federations, just a coincidence.)","November 19, 2022","Micropayments, Content Monetization, Advertising"
Some thoughts on Mastodon,"It is, by far, the fastest-growing social network in history, growing more than 20% in about a week.
And yet it didn’t stutter much.
How can this be?
It’s a network in the real internet sense of the word. It’s not just a network of users, it’s anetworkof servers as well. No one owns it.Like email, it’s a set of principles and rules, not a place. A federation is different than a corporation. It might not be as shiny, but it’s far more resilient.
It’s inconvenient. You can’t get started in ten seconds. This leads to less initial stickiness. It means that the people who get through the learning curve are more likely to be committed and perhaps generous. In the early days of email, of Compuserve, of AOL, of the web, of just about every network I’ve been part of, these early users created a different sort of magic. It never lasts, but it’s great to see.
I started one of the first internet companies in 1990, and the new frontiers tend to rhyme with each other. This might be one.
Part of the power of a network is its distributed nature. That’s a plus when it comes to tech and innovation. It’s a minus when it comes to the speed of central agreement as well as the potential for abuse. Email never quite recovered from the open nature of inputs, which meant that spammers, scammers and hustlers could do what they liked, and the defense was imperfect filters.
The intentional decentralization of the Mastodon federation seems designed to make those filters more natural and effective, at the expense of a super loud amplifier in the middle. You candiscovernew voices and ideas, but there isn’t a megaphone at work, just begging to be hacked by selfish behavior. It’s a bit more like life and a bit less like traditional social networks that create controversy to earn a profit.
And finally–the culture of this federation is still being created. A lot of the folks who just arrived will be the authors of that culture, and if they figure out how to be generous and kind, that’s what will get built. Alas, as is often the case, culture is up to us, particularly when the commercial bias is removed.
I’m reposting my daily bloghere, and might dip in from time to time, and I’m eager to see how this peer to peer experiment unfolds.

Sorry/thanks,"If you often find yourself saying “sorry” in a way that doesn’t advance the conversation, it might be interesting to substitute “thank you” instead.
So, “I’m sorry this came out of the kitchen after your other dishes,” becomes, “thank you for waiting so patiently.”
And, “I’m sorry we got disconnected,” becomes, “thank you for calling back.”

Whining and status,"Toddlers don’t get afforded a lot of respect. They whine all the time about how unfair things are, and it’s difficult to take them seriously.
Lately, in our quest for victory, we’ve established that some winners get there via whining, and perhaps this is a useful strategy. It seems as though working the refs, blaming the conditions and questioning the score is all good as long as it helps you come out on top.
In fact, whining isn’t resilient or scalable.
People with confidence, power and reserves are able to admit when they are wrong, when things aren’t working and when it doesn’t turn out the way they hoped.

Palliative care,"Few branches of medicine have created as much comfort, solace and relief.
When we realize that traditional Western medicine is not going to be able to cure a life-threatening illness, the palliative care team is able to help. Instead of torturing and bankrupting patients, they can offer connection, humanity and closure.
Too often, we view the fight as an unalloyed virtue. Instead of sharing our preferences and desires before we get ill (as though it’s some sort of bad luck charm), we simply hope for the best and then wait far too long (and create too much family stress) before embracing the next step in our journey.
And, since I often look for metaphors, it’s probably worth noting that the same approach works for projects, companies and even relationships. We might all come out ahead if we focus on a productive and comfortable way to wrap things up, instead of fighting to the last moment.","November 14, 2022","Palliative care, comfort, end-of-life planning"
Placebos and objective reality,"A placebo is a human intervention that changes the story we tell ourselves. And those stories are powerful. They can alleviate pain, make wine taste better, improve our golf swing and even grow hair.
Because the placebo is so powerful, we spend a lot of time and money on it. Entire industries (like fashion) are built on bringing people something that changes the way they interact with themselves and the world. If you think that copper bracelet is going to relieve your arthritis, it might.
But in the last few generations, we’ve built more and more of our world on a foundation of measured, consistent engineering. There’s nothing you can add to your gas tank that will make your car mileage go up. It doesn’t matter whether you believe the car is running more efficiently–it either is or it isn’t, and it isn’t.
If you’re a maker of placebos, then, it helps to recognize that what you do is change the story. The more a market is based on mutually agreed upon measurements, the less appealing it is to the maker of a placebo.","November 13, 2022","Placebo, perception, objective reality"

The solution, if we’re serious, is to ban gas leaf blowers. The replacements will pay for themselves in a few weeks. Once the competitive playing field is re-set, gardeners will come out ahead. Employee well-being will increase, and the leaves will still get blown.

Did the ad work?,"Digital advertising has turned millions of people and organizations into not just the target of ads, but the advertisers as well.
But it doesn’t easily answer the obvious question: Did that ad work?
Long before digital ads were invented, my late friend Lester Wunderman coined the term “Direct Marketing.” This is measured, active advertising. Spend $10 on an ad and you’ll know by tomorrow if you made $20 or lost five.
Lester helped invent the American Express card and grew the Columbia Record Club, among other direct marketing heroics. The secret is simple: Measure an ad, and if it ‘works’, do it more.
And so, Google. Google makes billions of dollars selling direct marketing to organizations that aren’t being particularly brave, insightful or clever. They’re simply testing, measuring and repeating.
On the other hand, ads on podcasts or Twitter almost never measure well. They rarely seem to ‘work’ in the P&L sense, because they’re brand ads, not direct ads.
The purpose of a brand ad is to deliver a hard-to-measure but important feeling to the potential consumer. The brand ad tells a story, builds trust and most of all, helps a customer decide that this brand makes them feel good enough (hard to define) that they’ll pay extra for it.
If you try to measure brand ads, like quarks and other quantum phenomena, the benefits disappear. The very things you would do to make them measure better cause them to be pretty lousy brand ads.
Running brand ads in a medium that is counter to what the brand is trying to accomplish makes very little sense, regardless of how much it costs. On the other hand, sponsoring interactions that build trust and connection is hard to overpay for.
All a long way of saying that advertisers in the digital space are finally spending more time and energy thinking about the places they’re advertising and wondering about whether they’re simply making more noise or actually making a difference.","November 10, 2022","Digital Advertising, Direct Marketing, Brand Ads"

Until one day, people wake up and are shocked to discover that they’re advocating for (or doing something) that is clearly wrong. It didn’t make them uncomfortable yesterday, but the reality of what’s being done is so different from the person we’d like to be that a break occurs.
The question is: If no one else was doing this, arguing for it, insisting on it–would we? Is it something you felt strongly about before the tribe and its leader took it on?
We can avoid this by staying away from institutions that profit from pushing participants further than they’d want to go on their own. If the heroes are extremists (in any sense of that word) don’t be surprised if participants are pushed to be so as well. And even more powerfully, we can remind ourselves of our first principles, about what matters more than winning or being popular.

Gatekeepers and judgment,"Infinity is seductive.
1,000 emails take up just as much space (and cost just as much) as one. An online bookstore can carry every book ever published. And the long tail of music gives every single person a chance to share their work.
The simplest thing to do is “let the market sort itself out.” No judgment.
That’s what the algorithms of the tech world purport to do. No judgment about taste, quality or standards. Hands off about sources, repercussions or impact.
It’s easier. And at some level, it seems more fair.
Without the scarcity of limited shelf space, it’s easy to embrace infinity.
But no judgment is still a judgment in itself. When a site publisheseveryidea on its platform, promoting each based on a non-published formula, they’ve made a judgment about the power of ideas and the way a community can evolve. This is new. Libraries, bookstores, radio stations–all of the keepers of our culture–danced with scarcity and influence and responded with judgment. If you can’t carry or promote everything, then judgment is the obvious response. Because you have to pick something.
But when companies demur and refuse to make a judgment, infinity and scarcity collide. Institutional reputation and knowledge have value, and by ignoring them, the big tech companies are making a statement about that value. Each seems to be trying harder than the next to help users fail to understand what’s worth trusting.

Logic is a special case,"We agree on so many things. Productive arguments are scarce, because they depend on shared constructs of reality. And arguments are a luxury, because they allow people to engage around ideas without resorting to external forces or authorities for resolution.
An argument might be flawed because it relies on facts that aren’t in evidence. If you’re asserting that X happened and it didn’t, the rest of your argument is hard to deliver.
And the argument might be flawed because even if X is true, it doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter because in the reality we are in, the logic of this argument doesn’t hold up, X or no X.
Or the argument could be weak, because the words are non-specific, and change in meaning as you go.
Feelings are real, and they can be shared. By all means, let us know. Feelings aren’t arguments. They are different. Arguments have evidence, specificity and logic that enable us to see how things are and to make them better.

Scale and the small business (freelancer grid),"Theindustry giantswant tonnage. Undifferentiated, commodity-priced, regularly delivered, consistent work for hire.

Most organizations are fundamentally incapable of planning ten years out. When a company promises to be carbon neutral by 2030, they’re actually saying that they may never be.
That’s because almost all the pressures on them are short-term pressures. And it doesn’t help that few people expect to be in the same job or even at the same company then. So it’s easier to simply describe something in the distant future and then “go back to work” where work means obsessing about the short term.
Of course, it’s not just companies that do this. Individuals do too, and companies are simply groups of people.
Changing our definition of ‘now’ and ‘later’ is a powerful competitive advantage.","December 26, 2022","long-term planning, carbon neutral, short-term pressures"
Our dreaming opportunity,"School and work push us to avoid real dreams. Dreamers are dangerous, impatient and unwilling to tolerate the status quo. Existing systems would prefer we simply fit in.
The dreams we need to teach are the dreams of self-reliance and generosity. The only way for us to move forward is to encourage and amplify the work of people who are willing to learn, to see and to commit to making things better.
It turns out that reading and writing are the cornerstones of this practice, now more than ever. These are the two skills most likely to produce exponential results.
The effective writer can see their ideas spread to a hundred people overnight, or perhaps a million. Writing is still the bedrock tool we use to codify and share ideas, and it forces us to organize our thoughts.
But we can’t say it until we see it, which requires the commitment to reading and understanding, combined with the guts to dream and to lead.

It might make more sense to try to find empathy for the fear and status issues that the client has instead. Because those issues probably got in the way of them ever seeing what you had to say.

Switching gears,"When a car is switching gears, the engine is providing no forward power. And it’s more difficult to steer, brake or otherwise control the forward motion of the car as you change it from one gear ratio to another.
And yet, the only way to effectively switch gears is to do it while moving. To use your forward momentum to overcome the pause in the engine’s power.

Staring at decisions,"Soap is 85 cents a bar or two for a dollar. Which should you buy?
It depends. It depends on how much space you have, whether you like this brand, how full your cart is and whether or not you’re sure if the person who sent you to the market wants you to buy two.
It’s easy to focus on these sorts of low-value decisions.
There are organizations that spend far more time discussing a new logo than analyzing where to place the new office. One is filled with emotion and no economic importance, the other is fuzzy, complicated and incredibly expensive.
Perhaps you’ve seen someone spend emotion and focus figuring out a tip to the penny, but impulsively use credit card debt to go on a fancy vacation.
Marketers have pushed us to spend as little time as possible thinking about things like long-term debt, the implications of going to a famous college or the lifetime emissions of buying a certain kind of car or house. But we end up spending countless cycles on the trivial choices that make us feel like we have control over the world around us.

Slow modems,"The internet doesn’t have to be this way. It seems like the structure we live with and struggle with and sometimes work against is pre-ordained and obvious, but much of it is the result of the origin of the consumer net.
Slow modems in particular.
When the WELL and AOL and other services began to define how billions of people would eventually connect, the physics were clear:
We had incredibly slow connections
We had dumb, underpowered computers
That meant that a central server was essential, and the person who owned that server was likely to want to make a profit.
Which led to:
And so we ended up with the following expectations:
In 2022, just about everyone online has a connection speed at least 1,000 times faster than the original consumer dial-up modems, and a computer that is as powerful (even if it’s a phone) as those original hosts.
If we cared enough, we could imagine a federated internet. One where the control and the power doesn’t lie with a single corporate titan with whims, with lock in and with spam, but with individuals showing up much more like we do in real life, owning our words and our data and our participation.

If fusion arrives in a workable fashion in the next few years, the entire world changes, forever, and for the better. Geopolitics and the axis of colonialism/petrostates will be quickly rewritten. Climate issues will be transformed. Our ability to feed, house and enrich the lives of billions of people will be dramatically amplified.

If a book was written by a ghost writer, or a team of ghost writers, does that make it less of a book? Not worth reading?
At some point, these aren’t simply philosophical debates. Given the connected nature of our economy and the advances of AI, these questions are showing up in our lives every single day.

It means that creating huge amounts of mediocre material is easier than ever before. You can write a bad Seinfeld script in about six minutes.

When we look in the mirror,"When we look in the mirror, who do we see?
[A note I sent to a young friend.]
The person we see when we look in the mirror is the person we become, the person we fight to defend and persist with.
If you see someone who doesn’t have a lot of friends, then every time a potential friend comes along, you will find a way to distance yourself from the heartache of being rejected, and you’ll continue to not have a lot of friends.
If you see someone who isn’t happy with inputs you can’t control, then when new inputs come along, you’ll find something wrong with them and seek more control not less.
If you see someone who thrives on challenges, challenges will become a chance to thrive.
Each day gives us the best chance in the world to see a different person in the mirror.
A chance to change the stories we tell ourselves.
Airplanes rarely crash. It doesn’t matter. Turbulence isn’t fatal. It doesn’t matter. If you want to tell yourself a story about air travel, that’s your story and as far as you can take it, it’s true. It’s your story and no one can take it away from you.
Perhaps you’re homesick. Home is great. Home is wonderful. Missing home is a sign that you have a home worth missing. Being homesick is a story we tell ourselves about who we are.
But who will youbecome? Who can you become?
It turns out that when you’re surrounded by people who care about you, when you have freedom and a chance to lead, you can become a different, more generous, happier, more powerful, more friended version of yourself.

Population and big innovations,"It’s tempting to embrace the meme that the best way for humans to solve the big problems in front of us is to increase the population, perhaps dramatically. The thinking goes that people are the ones who can solve problems, and more people give us more problem-solvers.
This doesn’t hold up to a reductio ad absurdum analysis: clearly, a population of 10 people isn’t as good at solving problems as one with a billion, but at the same time, if there were a trillion people on Earth, that wouldn’t last long. There must be a number that’s optimal, but it’s probably not the biggest number we can possibly create.
And reviewing the data on Nobel prizes per capita, or patents per capita, we see that there isn’t a correlation between population density and productive breakthrough innovation. It looks like innovations are more likely the result of a civil society, sufficient resources, enough productivity to enable spending on R&D and a culture of research and engineering.
We also see geographic hotbeds of innovation over time (physics in Germany a hundred years ago, or network innovations in Silicon Valley a decade ago) that are the result of information exchange and cultural expectations, not population density.

New ways to codify purpose,"And then what happens?
Many small businesses start with generosity and good intent at their core. But it’s a rough ride, and especially when outside funding is involved, it’s easy to get seduced by the bright lights of Milton Friedman and an obsession with short-term profits.
Over time, purpose starts to fade. The urgencies and demands of quarterly results, the opportunities for growth followed by more growth make it ever more difficult to stick with what we set out to do in the first place.
This postfrom Ari Weinzweig highlights a different way to stay on track, adding a level of structure to the good intent. It takes the sometimes mushy language of a B Corp and makes it legally and permanently part of the deal.
By codifying the structure from the start, we’re creating organizations that have boundaries. Boundaries aren’t necessarily a defect–they can be a feature. A boundary gives us something to lean against (leverage) and it also communicates to our constituents exactly what we’re here to do.
For a long time, we’ve been evolving in only one direction–companies that seek nothing but short-term investor returns, but do a lot of hand-waving along the way.
In a post-industrial business environment where people are more important than machines and where the consequence of our work are more vivid, it makes sense to bring intent to the forefront and keep it there.","January 28, 2023","1. Purpose

The thing is, there is still a choice: The choice of whether or not to go into the stable in the first place.

"Culture, care and typography","I’ve been fascinated by the way we set type since I did my first packaging forty years ago. It’s a combination of tech, art, systems, culture and most of all, deciding to put in the effort to get it right.
[This is a long post, it would have been a podcast, but it doesn’t really lend itself to audio.]
When airplanes first started flying passengers, there was a need for labels. Labels for passengers and pilots. WEAR SEATBELT WHEN SEATED. Why is it in all caps? My guess is that at the dawn of aviation, the machine that made the little metal signs only had the capacity to easily handle 26 letters, and they choose all caps. Certainly, over time the labeling tech got better, but we stuck with all caps because that’s what airplane signs aresupposedto be like, even though they’re more difficult to read that way.
Typography is a signal not just a way to put letters on a page.
Before mechanical type was set by pressmen in the basements of newspapers, type was handwritten by monks. As a result, we see the beautiful kerning of letters, nestling the ‘a’ under the ‘W’. That takes effort and as a result, it simply looks right. It’s not right because your brain demands kerning, it’s right because the signal is something we associate with confidence and care.
Once we see the magic of kerning, it becomes impossible to avoid how careless people who don’t use it appear to be…
There have been many golden ages of typography, but the 60s and 70s saw a combination of high-stakes mass production (in ads and media) combined with innovations in typesetting that meant that instead of using handmade metal type, marketers could simply spec whatever they imagined. It also meant that instead of one person working on a document, a committee would spend days or weeks agonizing over how an ad looked, or whether the new layout ofTimemagazine would send the right message to millions of people each week.
Pundits were sure that the launch of the Mac would destroy all of this progress. Now that anyone could set type, anyone would. So resumes ended up looking like ransom notes, Comic Sans became a joke that was taken seriously by some, and folks like David Carson set type on fire.
Instead, the Mac and the laser printer pushed the best examples of type quality forward. Once again, culture combined with tech to create a new cycle. Now, small teams of people working on small projects could also agonize about type. Now, as beautiful typefaces increased in availability and diversity, it was possible to set more type, more beautifully. If you worked in an industry or segment where the standard demanded careful expression through type, it was possible and it was expected.
More good type, a lot more lazy type.
And then smart phones arrived.
And the type culture changed in response. If you don’t have a mouse or a keyboard, if your screen is the size of a deck of playing cards, you’re probably not being very careful with typography. Whatever is built in is what you use. People create so much content that there’s no time for meetings, for care, for awareness. Speech to text, type with your thumbs, take a picture, hit send.
The culture shifts. Now, the appearance of authenticity matters more than ever. And one way to do that is to not put on airs with fonts that remind us of craft, or kerning that reminds us that you took the time to do something more than the automatic minimum.
And this won’t last, because the cycles continue.

The lonely zone,"For many, the goal is to be the deciding vote, the donation that gets a cause over the goal, the person who counts.
And often, we enjoy piling on. Once the cause or fashion or tech is clearly working, it’s easy and fun to say “me too.”
More rare, more vulnerable and more important is to decide to show up in the lonely zone. When it might not work. When the originator really needs your support. When speaking up, donating or simply showing up feels like a risk or a waste.","January 23, 2023","lonely zone, support, vulnerability"
Overconfidence and AI,"Human beings are often more effective when we’re a bit self-effacing. “I think,” “Perhaps,” or “I might be missing something, but…” are fine ways to give our assertions a chance to be considered.
The solar-powered LED calculator we used in school did no such thing. 6 x 7 is 42, no ifs, ands or buts.
Part of the magic of Google search was that it was not only cocky, it was often correct. The combination of its confidence and its utility made it feel like a miracle.
Of course, Google was never completely correct. It rarely found exactly the right page every time. That was left to us. But the aura of omnipotence persisted–in fact, when Google failed, we were supposed to blame evil black-hat SEO hackers, not an imperfect algorithm and a greedy monopolist.
And now, ChatGPT shows up with fully articulated assertions about anything we ask it.
I’m not surprised that one of the biggest criticisms we’re hearing, even from insightful pundits, is that it is too confident. That it announces without qualification that biryani is part of a traditional South Indian tiffin, but it’s not.
Would it make a difference if every single response began, “I’m just a beta of a program that doesn’t actually understand anything, but human brains jump to the conclusion that I do, so take this with a grain of salt…”
In fact, that’s our job.
When a simple, convenient bit of data shows up on your computer screen, take it with a grain of salt.
Not all email is spam.
Not all offers are scams.
And not all GPT3 responses are incorrect.
But it can’t hurt to insert your own preface before you accept it as true.

Amazon Smile gets a frown,"I’m pretty sure how the first meetings went almost a decade ago:
“Well, we’re paying our affiliates 5% for referrals. If we pay charities a tenth of that and call it a donation, it’ll be great PR and we’ll also make a profit on every sale because we won’t need to pay a full commission…”
Amazon didn’t invent the online affiliate concept, but the company certainly turned it into a significant engine for growth. If a consumer bought a $100 item that someone in their program linked to, they would pay the referrer about $5. That meant they had little chance of actually turning a profit on that sale, but it led to millions of new customers, people who came back again and again. It also usually turned one sale into a few…
The end result is that Amazon has paid many billions of dollars in affiliate fees, and their affiliates (like Wirecutter,CoolTools, and formerly, Squidoo) sometimes built entire businesses around the simple idea that recommending a product and sending someone to the biggest online retailer to buy it could lead to income.
Smileturned more than a million non-profit charities into affiliates at a bargain rate. Now, that $100 purchase turned into forty cents sent to the cause of your choice.
I used to send you, my esteemed readers, to Smile links, but when I realized how little each donation was, I switched to geni.us, and so our donations went up 10x.
To date, Amazon Smile has sent charities more than $500,000,000. That’s not a ‘donation’ of course, it’s simply an allocation of marketing spend. And yet, half a billion dollars makes them a very significant donor in aggregate, one of the biggest corporate donors in the world.
So why cancel the program?
I have a few guesses:
Western industrial culture has had a hard time thinking about charity all the way back to Community Chest and the United Way. If the ‘game’ is to maximize profit, then sending money to good causes seems to undermine that. Some people argue that companies have a corporate social responsibility, that the compact they sign with the community is to not simply take as much profit as possible but to invest for the long-term well-being of the places they work and the people they work with. Or, as may be the case here, it’s simply a marketing tool.","January 20, 2023","Amazon Smile, affiliate marketing, corporate social responsibility"

But what if we separated the two and simply chose generosity because we could?
It turns out that happy people are more likely to be generous. (Which implies that generous people are more likely to be happy). Not because they get something measurable in return, but simply because abundance is a choice. And making choices celebrates our agency and potential.

The platform and the curator,"Who has their hand on the dial?
Talk with someone who works at Apple, Amazon, Google, Linkedin, Facebook, etc, and they’ll be happy to give you tips on how to work the platform to your advantage. How to get a bit more attention for your podcast or your website or your photos…
Unstated in this helpful posture is an unseen bias: They have a platform mindset.
This is the opposite of the thinking at a record label or a book publisher or a newspaper. They understand that their most important job is curation–choosing what goes on the front page.
Of course, platforms have long been curators, but they embraced the role instead of denying it. Radio station program directors decided what would be in heavy rotation and bookstore owners figured out what to put in the window or by the cash register. These platform leaders understood that their decision to promotesomethinginstead of everything was a key part of their job.
The platform mindset is sort of helpless. The algorithm is in charge, they aren’t. The data decides, they don’t.
In the short run, this bias feels helpful in a lot of ways. It eliminates gatekeeper errors. Since everything has a chance, being alert as a gatekeeper feels less important. When Decca famously turned down the Beatles, it was a mistake that cost them for decades. A platform executive doesn’t have to worry about this, since they can carry everyone and let the market sort itself out.
But there are two problems with this chosen, learned helplessness:
The first is that it’s simply not true. The algorithm doesn’t write itself. The rise in hate speech on platforms like Twitter is possible because the algorithm rewards it. The vapid recipes that people build on websites are there because Google’s algorithm rewards them. And yes, the noxious additional fees that airlines charge are there because the travel websites rank flights with hidden charges higher in the results than those that are honest about what it really costs.
When platforms grow in scale, they often add hardworking, well-meaning people to engage the public, sort of a buffer between creators and the algorithm, but they’re instructed that the algorithm itself is sacrosanct and off limits. We sell everything, we don’t know how to sell any (particular) thing.
Go to some meetings with Apple’s podcast team (the ones who apparently can make or break a podcast by promoting it) and you’ll soon realize that Apple isn’t really in the business of helping its many users find podcasts that will elevate, inspire and educate them. Instead, they’re simply feeding the platform.
Netflix, in its best moments, succeeds because they break the platform paradigm and shift into curation.
The second is that this platform-first agnostic non-curation ultimately leads to the demise of the platform. The aphorism is: Enough A/B testing will turn any website into a porn site. That’s because the short-term waves of data-driven, algorithmic feedback loops inevitably make platforms banal, then trashy. This is happening to Amazon–their Amazon Go stores in New York are dull. The search result spam on their site is worse. Inevitably, the people they most want to serve get frustrated, bored or bummed out and go somewhere else.
What to do about it? Well, if you’re a creator, it helps to realize that you’re probably not going to be treated in a special way by any platform that has a platform mindset. There isn’t a shortcut, there are simply lots of dreary steps and then maybe some luck.
And if you’re part of a platform that has scale (or hope to build one), this is the perfect moment to learn from the curation that came before. When we talk about the folks that built the parts of our culture that we’re proud of, we almost never talk about the platforms. We talk about people who had the guts and the taste and the energy to help others discover things that made a difference, all while winnowing out the cruft and the junk.

The end of the high school essay,"Good riddance.
There’s not a lot of evidence that getting good at writing book reports or regurgitated essays under typical high school conditions leads people to success or happiness later in life.
When typing became commonplace, handwriting was suddenly no longer a useful clue about the background or sophistication of the writer. Some lamented this, others decided it opened the door for a whole new opportunity for humans to make an impact, regardless of whether they went to a prep school or not.
New York City schools are trying to ban GPT3 because it’s so good at writing superficial essays that it undermines the command structure of the essay as a sorting tool. An easy thing to assign (and a hard thing to grade) just became an easy task to hack.
High school essays had a huge range of problems, and banning the greatest essay device since Danny Dunn and his Homework Machine is not the answer. In fact, it’s a great opportunity to find a better way forward.
The first challenge of the essay was the asymmetrical difficulty in giving useful feedback. 30 essays, 5 minutes each, do the math. It doesn’t scale, and five minutes isn’t even close to enough time to honor the two hours you asked a student to put into the work.
As a result, the superficial inspection system led to the second challenge: Students get more points for good typing and clear sentence structure than they did for actually thinking deeply, questioning the status quo or changing their minds. If you grew up in a household with verbally agile family members, you probably did way better on essays than your peers, but not due to much effort on your own.
The third challenge was the lack of clarity about why we were even bothering to have kids write essays. Clearly there wasn’t an essay shortage. Ostensibly, it was either to prove that they read what they were supposed to read, or that they were able to create cogent and persuasive arguments and analysis. Essays were a signal that you could read and you could think.
Except…
They were actually a signal that you could do just enough work to persuade an overwhelmed teacher that you were compliant.
So, now that a simple chat interface can write a better-than-mediocre essay on just about any topic for just about any high school student, what should be done?
The answer is simple but difficult: Switch to the Sal Khan model. Lectures at home, classes are for homework.
When we’re on our own, our job is to watch the best lecture on the topic, on YouTube or at Khan Academy. And in the magic of the live classroom, we do our homework together.
In a school that’s privileged enough to have decent class sizes and devices in the classroom, challenge the students to actually discuss what they’ve read or learned. In real-time, teach them to not only create arguments but to get confident enough to refute them. Not only can the teacher ask a student questions, but groups of students can ask each other questions. Sure, they can use GPT or other tools to formulate where they begin, but the actual work is in figuring out something better than that.
At first, this is harder work for the teacher, but in fact, it’s what teachers actually signed up to do when they become teachers.
This is far less cohesive and controllable than the industrial model of straight rows and boring lectures. It will be a difficult transition indeed. But it’s simple to think about: If we want to train people to take initiative, to question the arguments of others, to do the reading and to create, perhaps the best way to do that is to have them do that.
We’ll never again need to hire someone to write a pretty good press release, a pretty good medical report or a pretty good investor deck. Those are instant, free and the base level of mediocre.

The myth of luxury goods,"Luxury goods are items that are worth more (to some) because they cost more.
The cost itself is the benefit that is being sold.
There used to be a correlation between superior performance and price. In 1900, an Hermes saddle or a Louis Vuitton trunk was arguably better built for the work it was put to.
Today, though, a more expensive resort, bottle of wine or article of clothing is likely not the item of highest performance. It is simply a symbol that the purchaser is happy to understand and perhaps show off. Poor performance might even be part of the value proposition.

The Olympics and FIFA are corrupt and built on old models of media and geography. New ways of organizing and amplifying talent could create a powerful force for change.

Waiting for the hero to save us just in time isn’t nearly as productive as realizing that we have agency. We have the agency to quit when it makes sense to quit (ignoring sunk costs) and we have the agency to dig in deeper when it really matters (acknowledging that it might not work).

"Patterns, culture and theft","AI is here, and it can (or soon will) be able to draw, code, or write with more skill than most of us.
It’s tireless, very fast and very cheap.
Understandably, some creators are up in arms. They say that if an AI is trained on their photographs, their architectural designs or their cartoons, it’s a form of theft.
This doesn’t hold up.
If an art student studies all of Picasso’s 10,000 paintings and then creates a new painting that is clearly based on them, we call this the advancement of culture. The same is true if a writer uses a word that was coined by Shakespeare, or if a graffitist is clearly inspired by Shepard Fairey.
That’s how culture evolves. Taking an idea isn’t theft. Taking an idea is an oxymoron. Ideas belong to all of us.
We couldn’t and wouldn’t have it any other way. There’s no way to bake a cake, drive a car or write a sentence without using what came before.
GPT and other AI tools don’t actuallyknowanything. They’re pattern matchers and pattern extenders. And those patterns are called culture.
(Aside: There’s a difference between copyright and trademark. Copyright is a small carve out to protect the actual craft of creativity and its specific outputs. Trademark is a way to signal to the world who made something. If someone uses AI to copy an artist’s style and then tries to pass it off as coming from the artist, thatistheft. Theft oftrademark. Different discussion for another day.)
If a computer or a person steals your style, it’s an indication that you’ve made an impact on the culture. And the only response is to dig deeper and make another impact on the culture, not try to carve out your contributions to our shared modes of interaction.

If someone over there can do their particular work efficiently, and you can trade your particular work to them, everyone comes out ahead. It works even if the intermediate step is using cash. Sell your services to one person, use the cash to buy something from someone else.

The status quo might not be ideal, but if we’re afraid of change, if we focus on the costs of doing the work to make things better, it’s tempting to simply stay still.

And cars that go really slow and feel that way aren’t sports cars at all.
When you need to turn something up to 11 and risk your hearing, your bank account or your sanity to actually feel anything, you’re on the road to an unhappy ending.
I’m in favor of hot rod projects. You can go all in without risking everything.","February 17, 2023","sportscar quadrants, hot rod projects, risk assessment"
The leaping curve,"The learning curve is familiar to many people. It might be steep, but it’s continuous. Organizations (and people) work their way up it, one step at a time (it’s the black line in the graph below).
But there’s rarely a continuous learning curve.
Instead, it’s often interrupted by leaps. The moments when both feet need to leave the ground in order to get from here to there. These red boxes feel like brick walls (until we realize that they are our chance to leap.)","February 16, 2023","learning curve, leaps, growth"

"Fidelity, compression and culture","The alphabet is a miracle, one that is compounded by books. And the lessons we learn from this cornerstone of modern culture apply to organizations, meetings, tech, politics and almost everything we do together.
Your copy ofTo Kill a Mockingbirdcontains every single word that Harper Lee had in the edition she signed off on. Even if the paper, the page count and the typography change, it’s a high-fidelity duplicate of the original.
She wrote the book using the same 26 letters that every author in the English language uses, and when you read it, it will reveal itself in precisely the same format as she intended.
The fidelity is high. Every duplicate is the same.
And the work isn’t compressed. It unfolds precisely as the creator intended–26 letters, all available to each author.
This is different than AM radio or a song copy on a cassette. AM radio is compressed, and by the time it gets to you across the city, it’s also low fidelity. MP3s are compressed, but every copy is a high-fidelity duplicate of the first one. On the other hand, with cassettes, each copy loses something. Eventually the copies become nothing like the original. 800 copies later and you have nothing but static.
Lossy compression is forever. Information was intentionally removed. What you hear isn’t what the artist heard in the studio, and all the equipment in the world can’t restore it. On the other hand, math and computers can now often give us reversible compression, but that’s a different discussion. We compress information because smaller files give us a chance for higher fidelity and cheaper networking.
High fidelity means that each copy is what we expect.
Lossless compression (or no compression) means that we haven’t left anything out in order to get the fidelity or sharing to work.
Packaged food companies and makers ofcheap chocolateprize the consistency of high fidelity (every bar is the same, if lousy) over the magic of something special. So they blend ingredients and dumb down the recipes so it’s always the same. This compression isn’t done in error, it’s something they work hard on.
A Broadway show is high fidelity when you see it, but that disappears if you try to save it. You have to be there live, a reference recording on video isn’t the same. Telling someone about the show is not the same as seeing it.
And the script is not lossy compression. In fact, the script is exactly what the playwright intended, but the director and the actors embellish the script in each production and performance. That’s part of their job. Sort of the opposite of compression.
Gossip is compressed and low fidelity news of the community, and both get worse as it spreads.
One of the miracles of email and the internet was how high the fidelity is (instant perfect copies, forever) and the ability for text and certain forms of other media to be uncompressed as they spread. Of course an MP3 can’t be turned back into the original reel to reel master recording, and a Wikipedia article changes over time.
Language translations are lossy and also low fidelity. Nuance disappears as we swap one language for another, which is why a talented translator is so much more valuable than a computer doing the same work.
And meetings? Meetings at work are largely low fidelity and ultimately quite compressed. Unlike a memo that can be in and of itself, a meeting is a performance, and then it’s summarized, and summarized again, until it becomes a story that’s a shadow of what the person who started the whole thing had in mind. Nuance disappears.
Democracy is probably best served by high resolution and the non-lossy compression of ideas and arguments. Alas, the internet and TV, while adding speed and impact, probably lower the resolution and increase compression at the same time.
AsJeff Jarvispoints out in response to a great piece byTed Chiang, GPT and other AI chatbots are essentially lossy compression mechanisms for the web. They read the entire web and compress it on demand into a few paragraphs. Like Cliffs Notes, one of the problems of this convenience is that it can’t be uncompressed. The nuance disappears and is difficult to reconstruct.
Our lifetimes have seen this pendulum go back and forth, over and over. From black and white TV to color (this offers way less compression of the original image). From film in the theater to low quality streaming on a phone. From a landline phone conversation to a bad connection on a cell to a few characters in a text message. CDs sounded worse than a good LP, but SACDs and MQA can sound better in the right circumstances. Companies go from handbooks and memos to hallway conversations to Slack checkins.
Lossy compression is forever. Fidelity is a powerful delight. Stories spread and resonate, but by their nature compress the truth of what we just encountered. A novel is the author’s complete telling of the story the way they chose to tell it, while history books and journalism always compress what actually happened.
If you want to change the culture, or understand a technology in media, or do history, mess with fidelity and look for compression. Robert Caro is a low-compression biographer…
And now, AI redefines fidelity altogether, sometimes embellishing what was there before and presenting something that might mistakenly be seen as a high fidelity original.
And still, the alphabet is a miracle. High fidelity, low compression, resilient and widely distributed.","February 14, 2023","fidelity, compression, culture"

Human beings invented symbolic logic to make complex arguments based solely on the concepts in evidence. It’s a particularly advanced form of discussion, one that no other species is particularly good at.

“Home is wherever my cello is”,"Ben Zander is bringing the Boston Philharmonic and Beethoven toNew Yorkin a few weeks. I’m excited to see them in person, but it’s also streaming live. I hope you’re able to come.
While his impact on the musical canon is legendary, Ben’s ruckus extends far into how we lead, how we live and how we teach. Thebookhe wrote with Roz Zander is rightly celebrated as a classic among business/motivation books, and Ilistento it at least once a year. HisTED talkis brilliant and I could go on…
For me, the biggest lessons come from his passion as a teacher. He views his musical practice as a chance to enroll others in a journey, and the volunteers in his orchestras find that this journey–the chance to lean into possibility, to fail, to connect, to hear and to be heard–changes their lives.
At the heart of possibility is change. The passion for change is available to everyone:
The title of this post comes from one of Ben’s students. Each is asked to write about the music they’re working on, their approach and the change they felt. Of course, any 14 year old could easily use GPT to compose a more professionalessay, but these letters are far from the banal homework of a middle school student.

The magic of a page a day,"In 1979, the page-a-day calendar was born. It’s basically a book on its side, but the user rips off a page each day.
My friend Michael Cader took this concept and ran with it, creating calendars that sold millions of copies.
Of course, everyone knows what day it is, and if you really need to know the date, well, that’s pretty easy to find as well.
So why spend $20 on a block of pulped wood that tells you something you already know?
It’s the combination of presence and tension.
The presence of holding today’s message in your hand. “Bummer of a birthmark, Hal!” It’s today’s insight, and it’s real, right here and right now.
And the tension of not knowing what tomorrow’s will be, and realizing that looking ahead isn’t part of the deal.
I’ve always treated this blog as aspiring to a bit of page a day magic. The process of writing it gradually and having people read it that way is part of the appeal.
So, when Michael asked me to (finally, forty + years later) make my very own calendar, it was thrilling. And this is the first printed one I know of that includes videos.

And then that happened,"The world changes and we have a choice:
• Fight hard to keep it the way it was.
• Notice what happened and then decide to do something with that insight.
Thirty years ago, AOL was my company’s biggest client. They charged users $3 an hour to use their precursor to the internet, and paid content providers a royalty based on time spent on their ‘site.’
We invented a breakthrough game that was played in a chat room. Our testing showed that people (millions of people, probably) would play it for hours at a time. We developed a series of games with AOL that were fun and engaging, and were a few weeks from launch. It was certainly the most profitable project I had worked on to date.
And then AOL changed to flat rate monthly pricing. And the royalties went to zero.
“Well, that happened.”
The sunk costs were real, but the sunk costs didn’t matter. What mattered was that our project was built on a foundation that had disappeared. In less than an hour, we walked away from all of it, which enabled us to build the tools and products we needed.

“No photos”,"That’s what it said at the florist shop.
I’m guessing because ‘taking’ a photo sometimes feels like a taking. The creativity, skill and effort that goes into making a distinctive arrangement might feel uncompensated when someone simply takes the work and posts it.
This misses the real point, though.
Once you’ve made something worth photographing, having the idea captured and spread helps you, it doesn’t hurt. More than ever, people are paying for famous, even if it’s as prosaic as a famous bouquet, produced by the originator of the design.

Confusion about performance,"The thing that your product or service delivers could be called performance, and it’s made of two components:
–The story and expectations and cultural impact of what you do (the story).
–The deliverables that are objectively measured (the spec).
It helps to have both.
Many hard-working freelancers are confused about their story. Either they insist that their work is even better than it is, and they’re frustrated when others don’t embrace it, or they undersell the value of their presence, professionalism and effort.
And many institutions, particularly those that measure the wrong things, put an enormous effort into what the lab specs show, but forget to invest in a narrative that encourages consumers to give them the benefit of the doubt.","February 3, 2023","performance, narrative, expectations"

What if it were paid for by congestion pricing, digitally implemented?
What if public toilets were safe, beautiful, well-appointed and consistently maintained?
What if there were a tax on empty storefronts, payable after three months of vacancy?
Shortly after the invention of the car, society made many decisions about how cities should work. These choices led to parking lots, suburbs and a definition of what a normal city was supposed to be like. Robert Moses and others pushed for a specific sort of urban environment.
It’s surprising how quickly and inexpensively that could begin to change.

Rethinking the Sports-Industrial Complex,"School sports can have some valuable outputs:
And yet, many schools act as if all they have is a trophy shortage. They bench kids who might not (yet) have the physical attributes necessary to win, or they build huge stadiums, go on long road trips, berate students that make an error or simply act as if the only point is to win.
Fancy uniforms, the magnification of small differences and a cutthroat focus on the outcome is not something that leads to the benefits that most of us would root for.
Why not have a small league and swap kids around until the teams are evenly matched? Give every single player the same amount of game time? Reward kids for personal growth, not for being better than someone else who simply started with a bit less than they did? What would happen if the coaches were rewarded for what was actually valued by parents, not for recreating what people see on TV?
Perhaps we could begin by asking what school sports are even for. Are they there to entertain the fans?

Flashing on contempt,"It doesn’t have to happen with intent, in fact, it rarely does.
Micro-emotions appear on our face and then disappear in less than a second. Blink and you’ll miss them. But sometimes, people don’t blink.
We’ve evolved to be hyperware of these tiny displays of emotion.
And yet, most of us don’t even realize it’s happening. We don’t realize we’re seeing the signs, or that we’re sending them.
Someone who sends tiny flashes of empathy is often seen as charismatic. We’re afraid of a dog that seems, in a fraction of a second, to be angry. And we build friendships around our instincts gained from these flashes (or the absence of them)
I had a friend who didn’t realize that when she got nervous, she often winked. As a result, people changed their responses to her, because they misunderstood the tiny signal she was inadvertently sending. Once she realized what was happening, she couldn’t easily extinguish the winks, but at least she knew the cause of the responses and could act accordingly.
The same thing happens, but even more so, with other flashes of emotion. When someone is stressed, nervous or fearful, he might send out previously unacknowledged flashes and signals of those feelings. They might be beyond our control, but the reactions people have are real, and understanding what prompts the response is the first step in moving forward to address them.","March 25, 2023","micro-emotions, empathy, communication"
Delivering good taste,"There are lots of books on creating cooking, photography, writing and music. But they can’t possibly help you do better until you see and taste and appreciate what you’re trying to create.
If you think what you’re serving is good, but others don’t, more recipes aren’t going to help.
That’s why so much type is poorly set, so many self-published books look the way they do, so many restaurants are merely good and so much long-tail music is easily skipped and forgettable.
There are two steps to begin:
Show us an example of someone else’s work that you believe is good. A book cover that feels professional, a jazz riff that inspires, a pasta dish that’s unforgettable.
Then make a version of it. Not a copy, but something that rhymes.

They will lose your data,"The rules are pretty consistent:
We’re all creators now. Podcasting, videoing, photographing, spreadsheeting… and we’re building a foundation of valuable data as we go.
The software companies that produce the tools we use push their engineers in many ways, but not to create resilient storage systems that are sure to honor the effort and care you put into creating your data. They want you to believe that they will effortlessly and seamlessly maintain all the data you trust to them, but they actually spend most of their time focused on other things that they deem more commercially important.
That’s because convenient, viral or flashy are generally more profitable than resilient and reliable.
When a conferencing app lost a video I worked really hard to record, I realized that trusting them was my first mistake. If there’s a one in a thousand chance that a file is going to be corrupted or simply lost, storing it in two places or recording it simultaneously in two systems lowers your chances of failure to one in a million. I will never trust them again, and you shouldn’t either.

Because awareness without tension is useless.

The ghost in the machine,"“The computer wants you to click this button.”
“It thinks you asked for something else.”
“He’s mad at you.”
Thousands of generations ago, we evolved our way into a magnificent hack. It turns out that we can more safely navigate the world by imagining that other people have a little voice in their heads just as we have one in ours.
By projecting the narrative voice to others, we avoided fights that could be fatal. It’s a powerful shorthand that allows us to use limited brain processing power to interact in complicated cultural situations.
It worked so well, we began applying it to dogs, to lizards and even to the weather. It’s a great place to find the origins of bad decisions and superstitions.
The truth, of course, is that your cat doesn’t have a voice in her head. But we still act like she does. And that cloud doesn’t really have an angry face in it, a bug we see so often that we even gave it a name. Pareidolia is proof that the mistake is almost universal.
And now, AI chat is putting the common sense of this to the test. We know exactly what the code base is, and yet within minutes, most normal humans are happily chatting away, bringing the very emotions to the computer that we’d bring to another person. We rarely do this with elevators or door handles, but once a device gets much more complicated than that, we start to imagine the ghost inside the machine.
If it’s working, keep at it.
The problems arise when the hack stops working. When we start making up stories about the narrative intent of complex systems. Sooner or later, we end up with conspiracies, misunderstandings about public health and opportunities missed in the financial markets.
Emergent behaviors (like the economy and computers and the natural world) aren’t conscious.

Shields up,"Years and years ago, I helped theWeekly World Newsmake a book.
While their periodical was weekly, it certainly wasn’t news. They were just four people in a small office in Florida. They gleefully made stuff up every week. They had a few filing cabinets of stock photos, and they invented stories featuring UFOs, aliens, “scientists” (in quotation marks) and various other diversions for folks trapped in the checkout supermarket line.
And now, of course, we are all trapped in that line. And now, the algorithms are pushing spineless profit-seekers to bombard us with junk, junk that shows up on the home page of search engines, in our social media feeds and in our email.
Adblockers are one of the most popular innovations of the last few years. What I want is ajunkblocker. A big button on my browser that says “shields up.” And just imagine if it was set to on by default.
No celebrity gossip. No conspiracy theories. No weight loss breakthroughs. It would automatically block fist fights, trolling, urgent but unimportant breaking news, insights about the royal family, discussions of whatever happened to a star from thirty years ago, aliens, UFOs, MLMs, the latest pump-and-dump schemes, things that are true but irrelevant, things that are relevant but didn’t actually happen and stories designed to demean, degrade or intentionally inflict distress with little recourse available.

Is it possible to care at scale?,"After 25 years, I stopped using a certain credit card for business. It was easily millions of dollars worth of transactions over that period. Did anyone at the company notice? Did anyone care?
I still remember losing a client in 1987. Small organizations pay attention and care very much about each and every customer. Verizon and AT&T, on the other hand, don’t even know that you and I exist.
Small family farms have significantly higher yields than neighboring farms that are much bigger. That’s because the individual farmer cares about every single stalk and frond, and the person with a lot of land is more focused on what they think of as the big picture.
But it’s pretty clear that if you add up enough small things, you get to the big one.
Caring at scale can’t be done by the CEO or a VP. But what these folkscando is create a culture that cares. They can hire people who are predisposed to care. They can pay attention to the people who care and measure things that matter instead of chasing the short term.

Your own billboard,"Large sections of Los Angeles are studded with billboards for minor TV shows. These billboards exist nowhere else, even though there are televisions globally.
Obviously, there’s ego at work here, but it’s sort of productive.
First, there’s the ego of the producers/networks. They like showing their peers what they’re up to, and it probably makes it easier to recruit the talent that lives nearby. If you’re in the famous business, being more famous, even locally, is a boost.
And then there’s the ego of the stars. After all, if they see the billboard, it’s as ifeveryonesees it.
Social media is simply a smaller scale digital example of this very tendency.
And getting your billboard right–and doing work that makes it easier to get your billboard right–might be one of the single best side effects of useful social media.
But, like billboards in LA, it’s best to not take them too seriously.","March 16, 2023","billboards, ego, social media"
Simple techniques for complex projects,"Warm up the machines that take a long time first.
Stress test the go/no go parts of the project as early as possible.
If the cost is low, replace dependent processes with parallel ones.
Do the difficult parts when energy is high and the budget hasn’t been depleted.
Ship before you run out of time or money.
Invest in slack buffers for any critical dependent components.
Budgets are a tool, not a weapon.
Thrash early, then lock down decisions and don’t change them.
Assign each task to the least expensive/least busy people able to get the job done. (This is probably not the project manager).
Prioritize feedback from people with taste, skill and influence, not proximity or volume.
Identify go/no go points based on irreversible actions or unrecoverable costs.
Anticipate the difficult and high-risk moments in advance and reserve resources for the ones you can’t anticipate.

Conspicuous (non) consumption,"One way to show status is by demonstrating how many resources you have. A bespoke suit, a huge graduation party, a fancy building…  A bully who physically intimidates or an angry driver who cuts you off in traffic are each working to show their status and strength.
But it’s also possible to demonstrate security and confidence by doing precisely the opposite. The billionaire in a t-shirt. The person who holds the door open and lets you go first in line… these are also demonstrations of status.
The interesting question isn’t whether someone has status. It’s whether they’re gutsy enough to demonstrate it by making things better for others.","March 14, 2023","status, consumption, confidence"
Is it a t-shirt brand?,"Not all projects become t-shirt brands, nor should they.
The risk is in thinking you’re building one when you’re not. T-shirt worthy brands are a very small subset of the whole.
The question is: Would your customers want to wear your logo on a t-shirt?
Why?
If you’re creating identity, possibility, connection and giving folks status, it’s easy to see how you could build a t-shirt brand in just about any field. Sports teams do it for a living. Google had a t-shirt brand for a long time, and so does Penguin Magic and even Festool. I’m not sure, though, that many people want a t-shirt from BMO bank, Marriott or International Paper. Netflix might be, Roku isn’t. Of course, no t-shirt brand is for everyone, that’s part of the point.
If you’re simply providing a good service at a good price, perhaps you don’t need to go to all those meetings and waste so much time and money on “branding.”
Why would someone want to wear your name around town? What’s in it for them? Go build that and the t-shirts will take care of themselves.","March 13, 2023","t-shirt brand, branding, customer identity"
Allocating scarcity,"If we’re lucky, we invent something that’s going to be in high demand. Reservations at a hot restaurant. Limited edition trading cards. Concert tickets…
How to decide who gets them?
One attractive option is “first-come-first-served.” It feels fair, after all. The theory is that people who really want what you have will spend time (waste time) in line to show their commitment. But of course, this is a tax, and an uneven one at that, since some people value their time more than others.
Another is to simply auction off the scarce items. The good news is that the value of the scarce item won’t be squandered on time wasting, but will go to the company. But this might feel unfair, as it rewards people with more assets, as so many things do. On the other hand, it’s pretty clear that people allocate resources differently than we might expect.
The third method, the fairest of all, is to have a lottery. Invite your best customers, or charge a commitment fee, and then randomly allocate the loot. The good news is that you won’t alienate customers who feel as though it’s their fault that they didn’t wait in line long enough, or spend enough.
Each decision has effects. And it’s up to the producer to decide which emotions they want to be responsible for creating.","March 12, 2023","scarcity, allocation methods, fairness"
Revisiting stamps for email,"I started agitating for this in 1997 and wrote about it in2006. The problem with the magical medium of email is that it’s an open API. Anyone with a computer can plug into it, without anyone’s consent.
This creates an asymmetric attention problem. The selfish, short-term-thinking sender benefits by emailing as many people as possible, and the recipients suffer.
This doesn’t happen with traditional mail, because there’s a cost to sending it.
With GPT arriving, expect that spam is going to increase 100x, and that it will be eerily personalized, invasive and persistent. That it will be really difficult to believe that an email isn’t junk, because there’s going to be so much junk, and it’s going to be harder to filter.
And yet, email is powerful, and convenient and we’ve been using it for our entire careers. Is it doomed?
Some apps are showing up that are trying to create a paywall for email. An unknown sender has to make a donation to charity (the recipient specifies the amount) to reach your inbox. People have tried this off and on for decades, but it’s hard. There are two problems with this being widely adopted.
The first is that it creates an attention obligation on the part of the recipient. It’s socially awkward to sell access to your inbox and then ignore the email.
The second is that there isn’t much of a network effect, and while a few people might adopt it, the problems with email don’t improve unless it’s widespread and persistent.
Here’s an alternative:
A simple plugin for gmail (and then, eventually other providers) that tags the email you send and receive.
Senders who send more than 50 emails a day need to buy “stamps”, perhaps for a penny each. The money goes into escrow.
Recipients can easily mark an email as unwanted. They can also upvote an email, which will send a signal that allows their peers to be sure they don’t ignore what they just got.
If enough people mark your emails as unwanted, you lose your escrow, it goes to a worthy cause. If it’s legit, the escrow remains and you don’t have to buy more stamps.
If a sender doesn’t use the system, they’re not going to be able to reach any of the people who do. So not many people have to be early adopters before it becomes widespread–if you want to reach most people (and you don’t know which people have it and which don’t) you’re going to need to turn on the tagging. It’s a tiny cost to pay for attention in a world where attention is scarce.
Normal people won’t have to pay anything, and email will get better for them as senders and receivers. And businesses that mean well and do well ought to be happy to pay.
If too many senders view the penny stamp as a chance to spam people (and lose the penny) then just increase the cost of the stamp to a nickel, etc. Pretty soon, algorithmic spamming is simply not going to pay off.
Giving anonymous people and organizations the chance to steal your attention all day, at scale, seems like a worse idea every day.","March 11, 2023","email stamps, spam reduction, attention economy"

We’ve long passed the point where anyone can have an encyclopedic knowledge of anything. Even the encyclopedia doesn’t.

Dancing for the early adopters,"The traveling circus didn’t have to appeal to everyone. They rode into town with the elephants, the bearded lady and the Tasmanian Devil, and the people who came, came. Once the folks who wanted excitement were exhausted, the circus left.
The problem kicks in when the circus becomes permanent. When the company seeks to scale. When the public markets want the organization to move beyond novelty seekers and reach the masses.
Suddenly, the dancing that used to work is the very thing that is a problem.
Tesla launched the difficult-to-make and controversialCybertruckyears ago. It was a mammoth error for a public company, ceding the most popular segment of the car market to Rivian and Ford in precisely the moment they could have launched a boring, reliable electric truck that would have created significant and permanent market share. And the company’s overhyped FSD feature is now in wide recall, and half the large advertisers on Twitter are now gone. Public companies aren’t supposed to sacrifice mass for the for early adopters. They’re there to grow horizontally.
Dancing for the early adopters is a great strategy, if your scale is right. If you embrace your 1,000 true fans, if you organize and connect and challenge and interest a group of people who can’t wait for the caravan to return, you can build a successful practice.
Bob Dylan famously alienated his top 40 hits fans so he could go back to having his own circus. The Grateful Dead’s touring community was dismayed when they had their one and only hit, bringing a new wave of ticket buyers who weren’t part of the tribe. It takes guts to say, “no thank you” to the masses and to go back to having your circus.
On the other hand, most tech companies and fashion brands lose their mojoandtheir masses when they try to be the regular kind. They either make the product stale and dumb, or go back to having a circus, but this time filled with compromises.","March 9, 2023","Early adopters, scaling, innovation"
Projects and the red zone,"Many projects are never finished. There are countless broken and not-quite-fixed cars in garages. There are crafts projects, massive redevelopments and everything in between. They sit unfinished because of bad planning, lack of resources, and most of all, a lack of resolve and skill in overcoming challenges that might have been surmountable.
Often, projects get done, but over budget and with missed deadlines. They hit roadblocks (some foreseeable) due to the difficulty of coordination, supply chains and the status quo, and they get done, eventually. This is the roadwork near my house–it’s been two years of construction, and without a doubt they’ll get there, but it’s slow and expensive going. Normal work, normally done, with plenty of delays and a bit of drama.
The sweet spot is a project that is run by someone who has earned the skills to anticipate and deal with all the challenges that come up along the way. This isn’t a project where the deadline was met because of hope or good luck, but because effort and planning were put to good use. We see examples of well-run projects all around us. They show up when they’re supposed to because we organized to make that happen.
The last kind of project is one that broke all the records and happened despite the obstacles. Unfortunately, these red zone projects create a lot of scar tissue and negative side effects. You might be able to do them once or twice, but you can’t rely on them.

A deal’s a deal,"A fundamental building block of civilization is the understanding that contracts matter.
Regardless of where someone is on the current political spectrum (from Alinksy to Mises), things can be understood to work better if the boss, the vendor, the client and the freelancer all consistently do what they said they would do. Regardless of who has more power or clout, especially then.
Hustlers and con artists can try to cloud the discussion by bringing in irrelevant and emotional arguments, but we can come back to a simple understanding: If two independent entities, without coercion, agree to legally transfer effort or assets without harming others, that agreement should be honored.
It’s a moral obligation, but it turns out that it’s also the most effective way to have things work in the long haul. Centuries ago (everywhere) and in some places (still), people and organizations with power can simply decide not to honor a contract or agreement.

Creating value as an entrepreneur,"If you’ve borrowed money or sold shares, you’ll need to build something that’s worth more than your labor. Here are some key pillars where value lives:
Customer tractionPermissionDistributionThe network effectSmallest viable audience
Customer traction is the big one. Every day, are there more people who would miss you if you were gone? More customers who don’t want to switch to save a few dollars? More organizations that are building their future around what you do?
Permission is the privilege of delivering anticipated, personal and relevant messages to the people who want to get them. It’s not a legal construct, it’s an emotional one. Who wants to hear from you?
Distribution is a practical way to measure brand. How much shelf space do you have? Mental shelf space and physical as well.
The network effect is built into your product or service. Does it work better if I tell my friends and use it with them? Is this actually happening or are you simply hoping for it?
And the smallest viable audience is the building block of all of this. Have you figured out precisely who it’s for? And do they agree?

The generosity of concealment,"Human beings never reveal all of our emotions.

And yet we do this essential work without thinking about it or working to get better at it.
When we’re engaging with someone, both sides benefit. And a key part of our contribution to the interaction is a willingness to conceal emotions that would undermine the efforts of our partner in this work.

An end to pop,"Pop culture depends on scarcity. When there are only a few TV stations or a dozen radio stations, it’s likely that many of us watch or hear the same thing at the same time.
And so a popular TV show or song from fifty years ago probably reachedtwenty timesas many people as a popular hit today.
But the long tail brings other benefits. More choices, more innovation.
Not just a long tail of consumption, but also a spectacular decrease in the cost of production. Innovations in computers, cameras and AI mean that people can make content without permission from a gatekeeper.
In the latest AI breakthrough, here’s a recent Paul McCartneysong‘updated’ to use the voice of ayoungPaul McCartney.
You can hear a quick snippet here:
While this is technically amazing, what it highlights is that within a few weeks, we’re going to see thousands (or millions) of new songs created by AI and available on YouTube and streaming channels. Some of them will be mediocre. Some will be breakthroughs. And a few will be hits.
Creating music (or writing) is an inherently human activity, and it doesn’t go away. What does go away, though, is the commercial dynamic of thousands of someones in Nashville or Hollywood hitting it big big big with nothing but a typewriter or a guitar.
The end of pop and the rise of the long tail and AI brings us back a century. Just like it used to be–small circles of people, not mass markets. But this time with endless choice and a business model that is hard to visualize.

But pizza grew to dominate our diets with no centralized action.
They sell a lot of Tide laundry detergent. Billions of dollars a year, that’s enough pods to reach the moon and back.
Even though Tide usually comes in a big plastic container and weighs many pounds, we keep buying it. That’s because it’s convenient, easy to find and not particularly expensive.
One of the challenges of changing a culture that’s driven by consumption is that people voluntarily choose what to buy next.
And so we get stuck. Stuck with products and systems that we’re not happy with, simply because it’s easier to stick with what we already have. The status quo is the status quo because it’s good at sticking around.
And yet, sometimes we get lucky. Consider thissimple productfor washing your clothes.
It’s super convenient, even more so than Tide. It’s almost as cheap. It’s dramatically more sustainable. It has a jillion 5-star reviews. And yet, it has a tiny fraction of Tide’s market share (so far).

Or…
A placebo is a prompt for our subconscious to do the hard work of healing our body, increasing our satisfaction or maximizing our performance.
I think the second is way more likely, and ultimately serves us better.
When someone says, “that’sjusta placebo” they’re undervaluing the magic of culture and the power of our minds to actually influence how our bodies perform. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say, “we’re fortunate that a powerful placebo is available.”

Used as intended, Cliffs Notes and Quicklit were a gold mine of insight. They opened the door for real understanding, and often got to the heart of the literature better than an overworked high school teacher might be able to.

It’s a zero sum game–paying for a slot increases market share by stealing sales from the competition.
The thing is: all of that spend is paid for by the consumer.

Avoiding food waste confusion,"Everybody eats
That’s the biggest problem. While plenty of people drive or play pickleball, eating is particularly widespread. Seven billion people multiplies into a big number…
Creating the food we eat has significant climate impact. Some of the factors, in unranked order:
Even if we wasted no food at all, the impact of all of these activities would be enormous.
Clean your plate?
But the food production, delivery and consumption chain is filled with waste. The biggest impact happens on farms. Food doesn’t all ripen on the same day. Harvesting it is expensive and time-consuming. Pests (and birds) harm crops. Food is fragile. The economics of putting more time and labor into grabbing one last peach is greater than the economic benefit that peach produces. And, the distance from where something grows to where it is processed or consumed is non-zero.
It all adds up, and it’s all out of the control of the typical citizen. Consumer food waste is less than a quarter of the total.
Of course we shouldn’t buy more than we need, or simply discard food that can be turned into another meal, or useful compost for a community garden.
But climate change is a systems problem, and it requires systemic solutions. When we price carbon accurately, the efficient market will start to pay more attention to harvesting the last peach, or shifting to drip irrigation, vertical farms or simpletechniquesthat have enormous benefits.
In the US, restaurants waste nearly as much food as all homes combined–by the time the food is on your plate, most of the damage is already done.
We actually have the tools available to make an impact. Insisting on voluntary personal action is a long, difficult road, even if someone tries to build a business around it. There are hungry people all around us, and more efficient supply chains will allocate the food we’re wasting far more efficiently.
The cultural dynamic in many places of serving more food than your guests can possibly eat–as a form of status or generosity–is persistent and wasteful. But it’s just a small part of a system that needs fixing.
The shift in our industrial systems to climate resilience is a huge opportunity. It creates efficiencies and shifts our focus away from dead-end consumption. But we need to be clear about which systems have the most leverage and work relentlessly on them.

A treaty,"Successful treaties calm things down and let us get back to what’s really important. Sometimes, the fight becomes the entire point.

The explosion,"We spend much of our worrying time on crises. Our media is filled with warnings, coverage and fear of cataclysms. The big boom, the sudden end, the crash.
In fact, rot is far more common.
Things decay unless we persistently work to support them. Organizations, reputations, systems, health, investments… even our teeth. For every hockey player who lost a tooth in a game, there are a million people who lost one over time.
Fear the rot, the explosions are merely a distraction.","April 15, 2023","crisis, decay, fear"
Unfettered,"That’s unlikely.
You’re rarely going to get the freedom and resources to do your best work unfettered.

Real and apparent risk,"Roller coasters are one of the safest ways to travel (they end up where they begin, but that’s a different story).
People pay to ride on them because they feel risky, even if they’re not.
Air travel is really safe, and the airlines work overtime to reduce theperceptionof risk as well. That’s why turbulence is so jarring–it’s not actually risky, but it breaks the facade.
On the other hand, we regularly engage in activities and behaviors that are risky without perceiving the risk. The cigarette companies worked hard to make smoking feel macho, sophisticated and part of the crowd at the same time that they seduced people into feeling like they weren’t taking a risk with their health.
The most resilient path in most activities is to offer perceived risk to people who seek risk, while also creating resilient systems that aren’t actually risky. Because dancing with perceived risk creates growth, connection and emotional resonance, whereas actual risk leads to outcomes we don’t want.","April 13, 2023","risk perception, safety, resilience"
Design has a language,"And it changes over time.
You and I know what to do when we see a revolving door, or to speak quietly in a library. We have expectations of how the world works and what designers are saying with their work.
Here’s a photo of a device with two controls. We’ve been taught our whole lives that the bottom one, the faucet, is designed to control the amount of water flowing through a pipe. And the top one is generally used to divert water from one pipe to another, often used to control the temperature in a shower.
Unfortunately, this design has a typo. The bottom faucet was chosen by the designer to control the temperature and the top one turns the shower on and off. There’s no way to control the volume.
When you make a typographical error in your design language, you’re either being careless or seeking to lead toward a new way of interpreting the work of anyone in your field.
Over time, the meaning of something changes. It used to be that offering plenty of disposable plastic bottles was a way for a designer to communicate surplus, luxury or sanitation. Now, it simply feels wasteful and short-sighted.
It used to be that affordances in design for people with less range of motion or other disabilities was seen as grudging and mandatory, but now it communicates awareness, openness and thought…
In New York, designing a fancy restaurant to be quiet was a sign of luxury, now, restaurant designers seek to  signal scarcity by making restaurants noisy.
Kerning your type is a form of communication through design, and the rise of social media has added new meaning to poorly set type as well.
A list of rules isn’t helpful. Looking for and understanding the language as it changes is.","April 12, 2023","Design language, expectations, communication"
The freedom loop,"We spend almost no time teaching toddlers about freedom. Instead, the lessons we teach (and learn) for our entire lives are about responsibility. It’s easy to teach freedom, but important to teach responsibility. Because if you get the responsibility taken care of, often the freedom will follow.
When someone points out a lack of responsibility, it can feel like an affront on freedom, when it’s actually a chance to create more freedom for the rest of the community.
You can drive as fast as you want. But you are also responsible for not running over someone in a school zone…
The speed limit is not taking away our freedom, it’s reminding us of our responsibility.
When we build a culture of people who eagerly seek out and take responsibility, we build a culture that enables a special kind of resilient freedom.","April 11, 2023","freedom, responsibility, community"
The rear view mirror,"It’s almost impossible to safely drive a car while only looking in the rear view mirror. Only seeing where you’ve been is a terrible way to figure out where to go.
But it’s really unsafe to go forward with no idea of what came before.
AI plods along into the future, using machine learning to closely examine the past.
And radical visionaries often slam into unforeseen obstacles precisely because they failed to do the reading.

Consider switching sides,"One of the spokespeople for the new milk marketing campaign confessed that she doesn’t really like drinking milk. Sales are way down, and an entire generation is drinking other beverages.
Other than the people who are paid to sell or lobby for milk sales, few people are concerned. Milk isn’t going away, but it certainly isn’t growing.
Marketing isn’t the act of getting people to buy what you’re paid to sell them. Good marketing is the craft of understanding what people want and need and helping them achieve it.
There’s no need to sign up for the endless uphill battle of marketing against a positive trend. Sell something you believe in, to people who are eager to believe in it as well.
You’ll do your best work on behalf of an audience and a cause that deserves it, appreciates it and applauds it. If it’s just a job, you’ve sacrificed your best energy for a paycheck.

New decisions based on new information,"More than ever, we’re pushed to have certainty. Strong opinions, tightly held and loudly proclaimed.
And then, when reality intervenes, it can be stressful. The software stack, business model, career, candidate, policy, or even the social network habits that we had as part of our identity let us down.
It’s not easy to say, “I was wrong.” And so people live in stress, sticking with something that used to work longer than they’re comfortable with. Our challenges in shifting perspective keep us stuck in the past. These are sunk costs, decisions we can’t unmake, but they don’t have to be forever commitments.
One way forward is to rename this moment and change the story. Instead of “I was wrong,” perhaps it’s useful (if less satisfying to others seeking victory) to say, “It’s time to make a new decision based on new information.”
That’s not weakness. That’s not flip-flopping or even embarrassing.
That’s practical, resilient and generous.","April 8, 2023","decisions, resilience, perspective"
Two kinds of salad,"A useful metaphor for freelancers and small businesses.
Every good restaurant should have two different salads on the menu.
The boring salad is the regular kind. It’s there for people who know that they want a reliable, repeatable, unremarkable salad. It’s the safe part of a safe meal. It might remind them of their childhood or it’s simply the foundation for a nice evening without any tension around the food.
The fascinating salad is a chance for the restaurant to bring surprise, delight and care to the person who orders it. It’s remarkable in the way it combines unexpected elements, and even though the ingredients it uses make it accessible to people who have careful diets, it’s still extraordinary, and worth what it costs.
A fascinating salad is a marvel. It’s not that hard to create, but it demonstrates the passion of the person who produced it in a memorable, almost emotional way.
Too often, freelancers end up offering just a boring salad. It feels safer than getting rejected. Or they pretend to offer a fascinating salad, but at the end, they lose their nerve and simply charge more than they should for a boring salad that’s pretending to be fascinating.","April 7, 2023","salad metaphor, freelancers, small businesses"
Replacing bad systems with bad systems,"A metaphor involving parking meters.
Over the years, parking meters in town have evolved into a cumbersome, awkward system. Coins are heavy and you need to have them handy, meters need to be reinforced against theft and breakage, town employees have to empty the coins and securely deliver them to the bank, meter feeding allows local employees to hog spaces that might be used for shoppers… you get the idea.
But replacing all the meters is expensive and because it’s inherently a centralized system, involves a lot of lobbying as well as a group of people making a choice with limited expertise, a choice they’ll only have to make once, they can’t learn from their mistakes…
Enter Parkmobile, an app that promises everything to everyone. Except it increases the cost by more than 100% by charging fees, it’s awkward, has a silly password policy that makes it cumbersome to use, sends many many emails to users and it doesn’t generate more revenue or flexibility for the town. It charges people double and gives them less.
But you can see how they managed to find the budget to do the difficult and expensive work of lobbying one town after another to gain monopoly status.
The network effect is sticky and hard to overcome, and as we move the internet of things from our phones to just about everything we touch, it’s worth thinking about resilience, flexibility and the reason we need something in the first place.
Often, we end up compromising about our compromises, maximizing for the wrong outcomes and getting hooked on a new system that forgot what the original system was even for.
In this case, the first principles begin with why the meters exist in the first place. There are two goals:
At first, having people put a nickel in a meter made sense. It’s just enough of a hassle and just enough of a cost that it all balances out.
Thanks to the portable id that a smart phone offers, one simple solution is to have people scan a code that automatically gets them a period of time to park at a spot for free. The dashboard for enforcement is easy to build, and in a typical small town, the revenue loss is pretty small–a few more shoppers more than makes up for the cost of lost meters.
If one still wanted to maximize revenue, it wouldn’t be difficult to hook that scanning tool up to any number of online payment services (like Venmo or Paypal) and simply cut out the middleman.
Once we see we have cars, spots, drivers and phones, all in a dance, we can make new decisions based on what we want, not what simply polishes what we had.
One could also easily sell parking passes, give local discounts, senior discounts or even give merchants codes they could use for employees in certain spots. You could make it so that the first ten minutes are free for fast in and out trips, or have it so local employees pay less in long-term spots, or that shoppers can easily get their parking cost rebated if they make a purchase.
Or you could even rethink why cars are taking up so much space in our villages and towns and reconfigure the entire flow of humanity and traffic.
But all of this is difficult because of the many constituencies involved and the stakes required in making UX choices in public.
Design thinking is simple to describe in two questions:
Who’s it for?
What’s it for?
In the case of a system replacing a previous system, these questions often get replaced with:
What’s the easiest way to polish what we compromised on last time?
Part of the magic of WordPress and its success is that the open nature and decentralized user experience they offer allows the individuals and organizations using it to embrace their first purposes instead of backward engineering from a centralized monopoly and a bagful of money.
And a key benefit of distributed systems is that they improve over time. When you see something that can be made better, make it better.
When a system is new, few are watching, so a handful of people with intent can design it and optimize it. As it gains in scale and impact, it calcifies at the same time that new tech arrives to codify the decisions that were made when the conditions were very different.
The next time you pose for a photo, keep in mind that we pose for photos because the speed of an exposure used to be so long that if you didn’t pose, the photo was blurred. We changed the tech, but baked in the cultural expectation.
Sometimes, we need to take a deep breath and go for better instead of more.","April 6, 2023","parking systems, design thinking, technology innovation"
In and out,"Lots of organizations (and individuals) have plans and processes for getting the word out. In fact, we spend trillions of dollars doing so.
Do you have a plan for getting the word in?
Is it simply random chance that some ideas get to you and your team, that cultural and technical awareness just happens? How do the people who know share their knowledge with the people who don’t?
If knowing what’s happening is important, it probably pays to focus on how (and when) we discover the new stuff.","April 5, 2023","Awareness, Knowledge Sharing, Communication"
Leverage is brittle,"Debt is a financial miracle.
If you buy a property for 20% down, with the bank financing the rest, and it goes up in value by just 10%, your profit is 50%. (I’ll wait while you do the math.)
If you have a factory and can buy a machine that increases productivity, the money you borrow to pay for that machine creates enough profit that you get to do it again. And again.
Alas, the ratchet can also go the other way.
If that property goes down in value a little bit, you lose everything.
If your competitors buy better and more expensive machinery than you have, they can sell for less than you can, and your investment disappears.
Farming is difficult. It always has been. But leverage and debt make it a persistent challenge. If the weather is better than anyone expects and the markets are just right, you do really well for a season. But if conditions change, if fertilizer is hard to get, if there’s a glut–well, the bank still does fine, but the farmer can get wiped out.
The reason that supply chain issues were so bad is that leveraged organizations needed to figure out how to extract every penny from their cash flow, and having less inventory on hand seemed like a smart way to eke out a bit more leverage. Until a shipment is late and then it all grinds to a halt.
And… when a bank or an investor is considering two power plants, and they discover that the coal plant is 1% more profitable in the short run but 100x worse for the community, they go for pennies instead of resilience. Because leverage multiplies the value of a short-term penny so much that they feel as if they have no choice but to choose the fragile, selfish, short-term path.
Leverage accelerates everything. Learning to see it is a key step in understanding how to fix it.","April 4, 2023","leverage, debt, fragility"
On being missed,"Some friends moved away, and the cake at the party read, “We’ll miss you.”
Perhaps it would have been more accurate for it to say, “You’ll miss us.”
Because, after all, what’s mostly being missed is the community of friends and neighbors. Even when someone moves away, the community remains.
When a marketer serves a community, they create the conditions where they’d be missed–because the ideas or products or services they bring are important, not simply tolerated.
That’s a worthwhile goal.","April 3, 2023","community, friendship, marketing"
Foibles,"Our habits, preferences and idiosyncrasies make perfect sense. We each know that we have great reasons to embrace our ways and stick with them.

Fooled,"Now it’s a business model.
People are regularly fooled by crypto scams, NFT hype, opioid felons, algorithmic spam at scale, health claims, illogical political arguments, fundraising pitches, overnight shortcuts on the road to riches or happiness and MLM hustle. Your account has been locked, click here…
When it becomes the tactic of a scalable business, it’s not surprising that the fooling gets more refined and persistent.
Buyer beware. Of course. Of course we should check our gullibility at the door.
But this overlooks the simple cultural truth: just because it’s a business model doesn’t mean you’re entitled to it. Simply because it might be exploiting a legal loophole doesn’t give someone free reign to spend their days taking advantage of people for their own benefit.
Buyer beware puts the onus on the individual who’s getting fooled. But we also have the ability to separate ourselves from those that would seek to profit by fooling us. You can’t work against us and also earn our respect.
Culture is a horizontal set of principles that we enforce in service of the community. If your job involves ripping people off, walk away. No one wants to live in hustle-world, it’s not even a good place to visit.

On the other hand, caring can lead to heartbreak. Caring is the chance to make a difference, to actually be involved in what happens next. Caring puts us on the hook and caring offers a chance to contribute.

I think it’s also useful to flip it around. There are things you will have trouble experiencing until you read them in a book.
A useful non-fiction book is a map, not the territory. It’s a chance to safely experience what might be, to experience it before it happens.

Survivor bias and the mistake of stability,"An asteroid has never destroyed the Earth, therefore an asteroid never will.
This brand has been involved in scandals before, and it has always come back stronger, so there’s nothing to worry about.
There have been technology changes before, but we’ve always managed to find clients for what we do.
Survivor bias is the trap of only considering the successful entries when thinking about risk. For example, if you look at the performance of mutual funds after ten years, most of them seem to do pretty well. But that’s partly because the ones that did really poorly didn’t make it to ten years.
We are lucky enough to live on a planet that hasn’t been destroyed by an asteroid. But that doesn’t mean that other planets haven’t had their life forms extinguished–we’re simply unaware of them.

The first person,"“I” is first person.
“You” is second person.
“She” “They” “It” are all third person.
So far, so good.
But how can ChatGPT use the word “I”? And when we talk about ChatGPT, is it “he” or “she” or “they” or “it”? Because anything that is an “it” shouldn’t be able to say “I”.
We probably need a form of “it” that can be used by ChatGPT when it is talking about itself or on its behalf. Because “I” brings emotional and intellectual weight that confuses or deceives us.
AsKevinpoints out, the regulation to lead to this fix is really simple and easy to implement. When I say “we” I think we know what I mean. But when ChatGPT or other LLMs say “I”, what is being communicated here?
When we built thebotfor this blog, I insisted that the bot not say “I.” Because it’s not me. It’s a bot.
Inventing new rules for how language works is fraught and regularly fails. But it’s only been a few months, and it sure seems like we’re getting comfortable with not distinguishing between text from a person and text from “it.”
It might be as simple as IT, with the second t being capitalized. Or ix, which is fun to say and will help my Scrabble game…

Stevie and Marvin,"When Marvin Gaye joined Motown, he went with his strengths. He wanted to work only in the studio. He hated touring and was sure he lacked the charisma and other gifts that made some musicians great onstage. This didn’t really fit the label’s strengths, and he struggled to find his footing.
In 1962, Berry Gordy sent Gaye on tour with other Motown acts. While Gaye wasn’t naturally a performer, he was competitive. The tour managers discovered that if they put Little Stevie Wonder on just before Gaye, something extraordinary happened. Wonder was a crowd pleaser, a magician at getting fans excited. After a few shows, Gaye realized that he had to dramatically raise his on-stage game if he was going to be able to keep his gig.
Two days after the tour ended, Gaye was in the studio recording what became his first Top 40 hit. He became known as much for his live performances as his music.
His charisma was a skill, not something he was born with.

Compounding head starts,"When a six-year-old kid beats the other kids at tennis, that kid is more likely to be encouraged to play more, or to get a coach, and pretty soon, they’re much better at tennis than the others.
When a musical group has a single that gets some buzz on Spotify, they’re more likely to be able to find a producer or even a label.
When a candidate polls well early in a race, they’re more likely to get donations, attract consultants, run ads and not be encouraged to drop out…
There are clearly scarcity-based competitions in our culture that reward early success. Acknowledging this (however unfair or suboptimal it is as a sorting mechanism) leads us to two very different sets of tactics:
One alternative is to dramatically overinvest and overprepare for your debut. If early head starts are rewarded, be sure you have one. This can even involve entering school a year later, or running for dog catcher instead of the senate.
The other is to acknowledge that even though head starts are sort of random and often reward the wrong folks, you’re going to ignore them. Make sure you have the resources and resolve to develop your following and your skills regardless of how well you do in the first interactions. Day by day and drip by drip.
Most people try to do both, and doing both almost guarantees you’ll burn out.","May 22, 2023","head starts, early success, competition strategies"

A situation so perfectly created that we’re stuck. Stuck without forward motion, stuck with a narrative of insufficiency or suffering.
The places we inhabit are external, for sure, based on how the world treats us. But they’re often internally driven as well, a story that felt comfortable for a while.

Our homunculus is showing,"The little person at the control panel, the one who sees what the retina produces, the one who decides, the one who speaks up…
(This is the dualist solution to the free will problem–yes, I have a physical body, they say, but I also have a little human inside of me that gets to make free decisions separate from that…)
Anthropomorphism is a powerful tool. When we encounter something complex, we imagine that, like us, it has a little person at the controls, someone who, if we were at the control panel, would do what we do.
A tiger or a lion isn’t a person, but we try to predict their behavior by imagining that they have a little person (perhaps more feline, more wild and less ‘smart’ than us) at the controls. Our experience of life on Earth is a series of narratives about the little people inside of everyone we encounter.
Artificial intelligence is a problem, then, because we can see the code and thus proof that there’s no little person inside.
So when computers beat us at chess, we said, “that’s not artificial intelligence, that’s simply dumb code that can solve a problem.”
And we did the same thing when computers started to “compose” music or “draw” images. The quotes are important, because the computer couldn’t possibly have a little person inside.
And now, LLM and things like ChatGPT turn this all upside down. Because it’s essentially impossible, even for AI researchers, to work with these tools without imagining the little person inside.
The insight that might be helpful is this:We don’t have a little person inside of us.
None of us do.
We’re simply code, all the way down, just like ChatGPT.

The best marketing advice I have for someone writing a book is simple: Write a book that people want to share with others. And then make it easy for them to do so.
That’s such a simple concept, and yet it’s overlooked in one media sector after another.
If you want to build a vibrant non-profit, create one where your donors do the fundraising.
If you want a hit TV show, write one that your viewers want to talk about with friends.
And if you want your software to be effective, embrace the network effect so that it works better for all users when your users bring in new users.
Thefive-packis one way I’ve discovered to amplify this horizontal spread. My new book comes in a discounted set of five, with 25 free limited-edition booklets included. Each generous leader ends up with 4 extra books and 25 booklets to give away.
Of course, not everyone will choose to share an idea. But some people thrive on being nodes in the network, improving the systems that are in close proximity. When they have an efficient, leveraged tool to spread an idea, they’re more likely to do so.
People don’t share a concept because it helps the creator of the idea. They do it because it helps them.

So I went searching for it, trying out dozens of possible ideas.
I never found it. But I did find five other posts, posts that never would have been worked out if I hadn’t been looking for the other one.

Chores,"They’re essential. The house begins to stink if we don’t take out the garbage.
But at work, while they might be essential, they may not be important. At least, not important enough for us to spend a lot of focus on.
Chores are:
The bills have to get paid. But they might not have to be paid by you.
Entrepreneurs, artists and freelancers often spend a lot of time on chores. We justify this because outsourcing chores to others costs money, and in this moment, money is tight.
But that’s not the real story.
The truth is that if we stop doing chores, we have to do real work instead. The things that aren’t repeatable or proven. The things that are emotionally difficult, creatively challenging or simply requiring exploration and guts to pursue. If we succeed at this work, there will be plenty of money to pay to get the chores done.
Doing chores cheerfully and with skill is a fine hobby. But it might not be what you need to do right now.","May 13, 2023","Chores, Productivity, Outsourcing"
What’s a “techie”?,"A friend’s email said, “I know many of my readers aren’t techies and you’re thinking of putting this newsletter aside…”
We should get clear about what we’re talking about when we say “techie.”
I’m going to argue that involves a combination of two things:
But someone who says, “I’m not a techie” might actually be saying, “I’m willfully uninformed.” They might be saying, “I don’t give tech the benefit of the doubt and it’s uncomfortable for me to keep up with it… but by giving into those feelings, I’m intentionally falling behind.”
Some people go for a run even when they don’t feel like it, because they realize that keeping fit is part of the deal. Some go to the opera or a blues club or expose themselves to culture that isn’t an easy fit, because they know it makes them more useful, more interesting or simply more alive.
I think we’ve long passed the point where an active professional can simply choose to not understand how tech works.

Useful assumptions for teachers,"Not simply in the classroom, but anywhere we hope to inform, inspire or educate:
Assume enrollment. Either someone is committed to learning or they’re not. While many situations place people into a spot where they are compelled to show up (exhibit A: learning arithmetic in grade school), it’s almost impossible to teach well if people don’t care. If folks aren’t enrolled, then the first job is to change that. If you’re worried that they’ll click away or drift off, it’s difficult to do good work.
Assume good intent.This is a cousin of enrollment. If you’re worried that someone is going to use an AI to write an essay, it’s easy to spend all your time building walls instead of bridges.
Assume fear.Learning creates change, and change is scary. In addition, we’re briefly incompetent just before we understand… we know that something can be done, but we don’t know how to do it (yet). When in doubt, look for the fear.
Assume a lack of context.The reason you ‘know’ something is because you know it. You understand what came before, what’s next to it, how it works, what the language of your field is (both words and concepts). If you’re teaching something new, you can’t be sure that’s true for them. More time on context and less time on tips and bullet points creates the conditions for understanding.
Assume connection.Some would like to believe that learning can be done alone, in a tower, with a laptop. But in fact, until we interact with other people or systems, all we’ve done is absorb, we haven’t yet understood.","May 11, 2023","Teaching, Learning, Engagement"
Skipping the good days,"Part of the luxury of living near the ocean or the mountains is that you can be picky. If the surf or the powder isn’t great, leave it for the tourists. Good is insufficient, wait for the great moments…
When we’re young, or the project is going really well, it’s easy to waste the good days. After all, there will be another one tomorrow.
What becomes clear, though, is that good days are precious. When you’re feeling even a little creative, don’t wait. Write it down, roll tape, speak up. When you’re feeling reasonably healthy, go for a walk.
They’re all good days, if we choose.",,"Good days, opportunity, creativity"
Choosing your pacemaker,"Roger Bannister ran a four-minute mile by having a relay race of pace runners next to him. If he could keep up with his pacer, he’d finish the run in record time.
If you work in an office where people are regularly shipping breakthrough work, it’s likely your work will ship as well. If you’re in an industry or a zip code where entrepreneurs regularly build and fund businesses of scale, it’s more likely you will too.

What comes after trust?,"Walk into a bank with a stocking on your head and you’re probably going to get arrested.
Civil society as we know it is dependent on identity and responsibility. A person does something and owns the consequences. This requirement of identity leads to the dynamic of the free market that we call trust.
Even companies, which aren’t people but lately have been given many of their privileges, occasionally have to pay the price for abusing our trust.
But what happens when the email, the essay, the voice, the interactions–aren’t from a person, but from a swarm of bots? Is that really Donny Osmond singing us Happy Birthday or a clever AI construction?
[On the other hand, people are really making good use of the freeAI on this blog–and so far, it’s pretty trustworthy.]
When the internet began to chip away at our interpersonal relationships, we relied on brand names or clues to figure out what was real. We invented captchas and filters to figure out who or what was truthworthy.
A certain kind of trust is no longer useful. Selfish hustlers are going to be one of the first big winners in the AI race, abusing systems that were built on traditional ideas of identity and responsibility.
Then what?

Nihil hic deest,"This page intentionally left blankhas a longhistory.
I thought it was an IBM thing from the 1960s, but I was off by a thousand or more years.
There are good reasons for a page to be blank. Folding signatures, printing processes, having chapters start on the right or the left…
But there are even better reasons to let people know you did it on purpose. Particularly in a loosely bound book or a technical manual. Knowing that the page isn’tsupposedto have something on it removes stress and lets the reader gain confidence that the text is complete.
Of course, as we race to fill in every moment with swiping, surfing and clicking, it’s easy to forget that we’re allowed to leave some blank spaces. In fact, not just allowed, but if we want to live well, required.

The new way of work,"Amazon is the last one.
They are probably the last huge company where hundreds of thousands of people will be surveilled, measured and ordered to follow the rule book.
The pandemic didn’t create distributed work, the laptop did. Human interaction is critical, but the office isn’t actually the most effective way to create that.
David Risher might be mistaken.
The new CEO of Lyft just ordered all the workers at HQ to “come back to work.” Of course, they’ve been at work all along, they just haven’t been at the office.
It takes a different set of leadership and management skills to create the conditions for effective distributed work. But it’s incredibly powerful when you get it right.

The house painter and the architect,"We don’t design a book until after it’s written.
Or cast the movie until the screenplay is complete.
The house painter has an important job, but it makes no sense to plan for the painting before the house is designed.
This makes a lot of sense because some parts of a project have high variability which can lead to very different outcomes.
There are more than a billion ways to write a book, but fewer than 100 distinct categories of interior book design.
We desperately need house painters, gaffers and book designers. If they don’t deliver on their work, the entire project falls apart. But they don’t go first.
The job of the house painter is to amplify the architect’s vision, not vice versa.
So there are a few questions worth asking:
First, which one of the tasks is the dominant variable, the one where simply doing ‘a pretty good job’ is going to be insufficient (no one talks about the roofer on a Frank Lloyd Wright house–until it leaks).
Second, which job do you want? We need both, but we should choose the path that suits our goals.

And we also need to have an idea of what the next thing is. But if we spend too much time focusing on the next thing, we’ll neglect the thing we’re currently doing, to ill effect.

“And” fatigue,"Digital abundance creates a new problem.
Most of our lives are filled with “or” decisions. You can have this or that. You can save money for the big party or you can go out for lunch. You can have exactly one thing for dessert–cake or fruit.
But the war for our attention has given us more than a million things to watch on YouTube, another million songs to listen to on Qobuz, and unlimited bingeing (which didn’t even use to be a word) on dozens of streaming channels.
Noor. Simplyand.
This means that choices have fewer consequences. It means that time counts for less, it simply fades away. And it turns the sharp relief of choice into the borderless fatigue of ‘whatever’.

The seduction of grad school,"For a certain cohort of high-performing students at famous colleges, graduate school feels irresistible.
If you’re good at school, the challenge and offer of law school, med school or a famous business school means you get to do more of what you’re good at. You’re offered a high-status badge, a path to a well-paid job and several years of more school instead of the scary freedom of choice of what happens next.
And so, literate and passionate young people talk about their dreams of helping people, running for office, fighting injustice or exploring their passions as entrepreneurs. And grad school is supposed to be the path.
The problem is that these graduate schools aren’t optimized for any of those things.
Leaving medical school with a pile of debt and your twenties mostly gone pushes you to sign up for the doctor track, which is increasingly about systems and forms, not actually engaging with patients. Law students who came in with dreams of social justice often postpone these dreams for decades as they work for big money at big firms for long hours… You get the idea.
If you want to sit with someone and help them, a career as an occupational or physical therapist is certainly more hands on and direct. If you want to make a difference by writing or arguing, three years of law school and a bar exam aren’t the most leveraged ways to do that. And entrepreneurs need to know a lot, but not what they teach in a typical MBA program.
The stratified work of big name investment banks, consultants, law firms and fancy doctoring is increasingly veering away from the actual contributions of people who have an impact that they can measure and be proud of.
If that sort of work is for you, go for it. But do it with intent.
If not, then perhaps it makes sense to start on the work right this minute. Not with a full certification or permit, but simply creating the sort of change you seek to make, in small steps, right now.","June 29, 2023","graduate school, career choices, impact"
Portfolio theory,"One show can make Netflix’s year. One stock can make the numbers for an investor. One player can drive a team to victory.
The key is, “I’m not sure which one it’s going to be, but it’s going to be one of these.”
The challenge with falling in love with the potential of just one egg is that we often end up making the entire basket the same. That’s no longer a portfolio, it’s one bet over and over again.

Reality as reassurance,"Culture makes it tempting (and easy) to insulate ourselves from reality. Credit card debt is an invisible burden, until it’s not. Ignoring the changes in our climate makes our days easier, but not our years.
We can avoid the bank balance, not work on the annual budget and ignore the results of that ad we just ran. It’s tempting because the reality we create for ourselves can provide a sort of shock absorber, allowing us to focus on how we’d like things to be, as opposed to how they are.
The reporter of symptoms isn’t the cause of the symptoms, and avoiding the report doesn’t improve your status.
This is one of many reasons why entrepreneurs are drawn to the magical thinking that often goes with external funding. After all, if you’re focused on a story that gets you an investment, you can avoid the reality of a P&L, at least for now.
The problem with this avoidance is that we’re always concerned about reality butting in when we least expect it.
The Ponzi scheme operator is constantly wondering when the plan will go bust. Reality is your enemy.
On the other hand, a cash-flow, profitable business doesn’t need to worry about what private investors think.

The astrological zodiac gets us to twelve, but I’m having a really difficult time finding a memorable set with more than that.
When we start talking about trees or stars or even colors, the list isn’t clearly finite. Anatomy or species don’t work either. There’s always one or a hundred more to add. And human lists like saints or countries are hard to put in a memorable order, same with the US states.
The Great Lakes are five, the planets are eight. I wonder where we find a list of 30 to 100 items. And no fair picking something in Latin or involving multiple dimensions of advanced math.
There must be some sort of human or cultural limit that makes the alphabet a natural exception to our desire for this sort of knowable set.

The right marketing question,"The wrong question is, “our project isn’t catching on, how do we promote it better?”
The right question is a little more nuanced and far more important,
“We’re seeking to make a change in part of the world. How do we find the right people and tell them the right (true) story that helps them get to where they’re going–and that they’ll tell to their peers?”
It’s worth breaking this down and understanding the components:
make a change: Any project that seeks to maintain the status quo is difficult to grow. You’re here to make a change, and being clear about what that is is the first step.
the right people:Nothing worth spreading is built to appeal to everyone. So who is your someone? What do they want, fear and believe? How do you shift from being mediocre to being specific?
the right (true) story:Marketing is never about the full experience of all the facts, specifications and impacts of your product or service. It’s the story we tell ourselves about it. A story of status, affiliation, of change and fear. If that story is true, then you can continue to build on it over time, and users won’t end up disappointed.
that helps them get to where they’re going: It’s very difficult to prove a prospect or customer wrong. Hard to get them to want something they don’t want. The opportunity lies in helping them get what they wanted all along.
and finally…
that they’ll tell to their peers:Not to everyone, but to people who trust them. Why would they do that? They won’t do it for you, they’ll do it because it raises their status, increases connection or gives them some other form of satisfaction.

Peer support,"Treasure it when you find it. Offer it when you can.
One of the greatest joys of being an author is the other authors. The game theory would indicate that authors are competitors–there are a scarce number of publishers, of bookshelf slots, of readers. But, being the only author in the world wouldn’t just be lonely, it wouldn’t work very well. Books actually sell best next to other books, not in the supermarket.
But more than that, peer support comes when people are part of something bigger than themselves. When they see their work as a craft, and a chance to turn on a light or raise a standard.
In every field, our best work can feel lonely, because we don’t have a guarantee, a map to follow or a crowd of people sure that it’s going to work. That’s when peer support means the most. And when it contributes to the evolution and forward motion of a field.
“Peer” is a job title, and it’s earned. One way to earn it is by finding the others, connecting them and leading them. We spend our lives looking for peers to accept us, but in fact, we have the chance to establish the foundation for our peers to find each other.
While most people say that when they’re a stranger in a room, they’d like to be warmly greeted, it’s also true that we hesitate to be the greeter when a new voice arrives. That’s a natural instinct, and worth pushing back against.
Organizing your peers feels awkward. Who are you to invite three or four others to a weekly mastermind check in? Who are you to speak up about a new idea that isn’t obvious or easily defended (yet?). Well, if not you, who?

Project management,"A project is a promise. It’s about coordinating unknowable future events to deliver something of value.
Showing up on time for a meeting is a project (airlines! traffic! weather!) and so is building a skyscraper. That next podcast you’re going to publish is a project, and so is cooking dinner for guests.
There’s always uncertainty because we’re dancing with the future, with random events and often, with other people.
And there’s a need for management because left to its own devices, a project isn’t likely to get done on its own.
The unpredictable nature of future events means that there will often be unexpected speed bumps. No project manager has a perfect record, because the cost of being completely perfect in the face of unknown is too high. And yet, there’s a huge gap between great project management and simply providing earnest effort. If unexpected events happen to you more than the average expected rate, if you’re often better at finding excuses than a way to avoid needing an excuse, it’s a sign that your next project could benefit from a more intentional approach to shipping great work on time.
It’s not a surprise that we’re all pretty unsophisticated at project management. We’re pushed to begin with our very first assignments and creations in first grade, and we make projects, with increasingly higher stakes, all through school. And yet, no one ever teaches us that this is a skill that can be learned and delivered with strategy and technique.
The hallmarks of earnest amateurism are:
The professional, on the other hand, invests heavily to be sure that none of these three exciting things happen. And when surprises happen, they expect them, accept them and simply shift to the other route.
The most exciting thing about professional project management is that it trades away excitement for systems thinking and intentional action. We make heroes out of people who show up with the last-minute save, but the real work is in not needing the last minute.
And it’s helpful to realize that it’s a skill, a choice, a set of tools to be learned, not something we’re born with. Very few successful organizations feel as though they’ve underinvested in project management. By the time a project is worth doing, it’s worth doing with intent.","June 21, 2023","Project management, uncertainty, intentional approach"
Which team?,"Culture seeks shortcuts.
The oldest shortcut is: “Friend or foe?”
If we know the answer to that, a whole bunch of time gets saved, and fear is reduced as well.
The labeling goes beyond which team, cadre, tribe or village someone is part of. It extends to the ways we demonstrate which box we’ve chosen–fashion, pro sports, even the tech we use or how we speak. The search for safe shortcuts becomes an end to itself.
And then it can get toxic. When we start dividing people by race or identity, by background or caste, we end up losing dignity and nuance for the false shortcut of putting someone into a box.
But in our quest to put everyone in a box, we leave a lot behind. We ignore the chance to interact with someone who can teach us something. We sacrifice the benefit of the doubt in exchange for what feels like security. And we take away the humanity of people who don’t make it easy for us to find a niche for them.

Finding agency,"The first few moves of a chess game give the player almost unlimited freedom. There are countless legal moves, and nothing to constrain the choices that a player makes among them.
But as we add leverage to our culture and our organizations, the choices aren’t as easy.
Jerry Garcia couldn’t easily change the Grateful Dead’s touring regime, even if he wanted to. With a payroll of nearly 100 people, the organization needed to be on the road, playing ever bigger venues, to keep the machine moving. The same feels true for countless situations involving countries, organizations (big and small) and even individuals in a system.
The high school principal might be in charge of the school, but their degrees of freedom aren’t unlimited.
And one reason is that freedom and agency aren’t the same thing.
Freedom of choice implies that the repercussions of any given choice are mild. Freedom without responsibility feels like the goal.
But in fact, agency with leverage only works because it’s so difficult and comes with so much responsibility. The struggling small business owner can shut down a division, sell an asset or part ways with a partner. It’s not easy, it feels painful and fraught, but it’s still possible.
The easiest option is to imagine that we have no difficult options.

The A.R.E. skills matter more than ever,"Perhaps this is what your team needs from you:
Agreeablenessis not the same as agreeing. In fact, they have little in common. Finding someone who’s only job is to agree with everything that is said is easy. On the other hand, agreeableness is the skill of having a contrary position and being pleasant about it. It’s the hard work of bringing professional work to people who expected something else–and have them still be pleased about the changes. Agreeableness is a skill and it’s a choice. Being contrary is a form of Resistance, a way to deal with our fear.
Receptivityis our openness to better. We’re here to make change happen, and the path forward can’t possibly be perfectly known before we begin. Receptivity combines curiosity, awareness and a desire for improvement. The receptive person asks good questions and says ‘thank you’ to useful feedback.
Enthusiasmconnects the two, and it’s contagious. When the auditorium is half empty, with folks sitting in the back row with their laptops open, hesitant to ask questions–do you expect that the professor or speaker is going to do their best work?

What sort of bicycle?,"While it’s likely that you own a bike, you probably don’t have a front-wheel recumbentbicyclein your garage.
Even though it’s more efficient, more comfortable and often faster.
How did that happen?
In 1933, a twenty-year old speed record was broken by a racer on a recumbent bike. Concerned, the leading manufacturers of upright bikes went to the UCI and persuaded them to ban recumbent bikes from competition.
Nearly a hundred years later, the ban continues.
Of course, most of us will never race in a sanctioned UCI bicycle race.
But, the fastest bicyclists are the ones that spend the most time and money on their bikes. They’re surrounded by a circle of other bicyclists that would like to be the fastest. And they’re surrounded by an even larger circle that is inspired by them.
And so the status roles are set, and thus affiliation roles as well. And then systems are built and technology platforms are reinforced and it becomes simpler and easier and more convenient to buy and sell the regular kind. All because of one race 90 years ago.
Consider what happens when one person (now lost to the clouds of time) decides to alter an algorithm at YouTube. That simple tweak starts to deliver more profitable results, and so others build around that change, codifying into code something that might not be in the long-term interests of users or creators.
Now that it’s built in, it changes what gets produced and that changes what gets watched.
The office that 5,000 people commute to every day is there because forty years ago, someone thought that it would be nice to work near home, and that four-person office is now a megaplex.
We cut the tails off of some dog breeds because thousands of years ago, someone mistakenly thought they preventeddisease. But then it became a signal of adherence or status, and the system persists.
Little decisions compound and then anchor systems. Our commitment to defending sunk costs keeps those systems long after they’re no longer serving a purpose.

The seduction of compliance,"We can tell from the words. “I’m just doing my job.” “Will this be on the test?” “Don’t blame me.” “It’s what everyone else is wearing.”
Keep your head down, do what you’re told, don’t stick your neck out, and most of all, pay attention to what everyone else is doing.
All of this comes from somewhere. From individuals and organizations that benefit from our compliance.
The alternative isn’t freedom. It’s responsibility.
The responsibility to show up, to care a bit more, to raise your hand and to make a difference.
Compliance is seductive because it comes with short-term prizes. If you fit in all the way, it might feel a bit less frightening. The center of the herd may in fact be safer, but the view is terrible.
We don’t spend nearly enough time celebrating responsibility. Our niche in the hierarchy is actually irrelevant, particularly for those you helped today. What matters is our willingness to see what’s happening and to sign up to do something about it.
It begins with figuring out just who is pushing so hard for you to comply.","June 13, 2023","compliance, responsibility, individual agency"
Inconvenient!,"That’s great news.

Too much competition,"There are two approaches:
Broaden your offerings, make them easier, cheaper and more available. Dumb them down and race to the bottom.

The simple word replacement for connection,"What do we say when a customer or colleague says, “thank you”?
For a long time, it was “you’re welcome.” This indicates that you put in some effort and you’re willing to do it again on request.
Recently “no problem” has become more common. This implies that the effort could have been a huge hassle, but this time, it was okay.
For people who are choosing to do the work of hospitality and connection, though, the most accurate answer might be, “my pleasure.” After all, you had a choice, and you chose to do this work precisely so that it could have an impact on someone else. The story we tell ourselves about the work can be fuel for finding ways to do it better.
If it’s not a pleasure, and you’re doing things like this all day, it might be a good time to find something else to do.

Doing presentations virtually,"A few years ago, Ipostedabout the hardware setup you can use to look better and feel better when working in a distributed organization.
Since then, I’ve tried many hacks for how to integrate Keynote presentations into this environment. I used some fancy software that was heartbreakingly disappointing and then figured out a much better solution, from a much more responsive company, using a little-known technique inEcammLive. All the details of how it’s done arehere.
In short: you can create and control a Keynote presentation with a green screen built in so your face shows through–one screen for you and your slides that is easy to control and not awkward the way screen sharing is. (Keynote now also lets you embed your camera in the slides directly, but the quality isn’t as good).

What would happen if we watchedBryan Stevenson,Nazanin Ash, orJim Killoranbuild something instead? Not just watched, but actually helped?

Cheaper than that,"The race to the bottom has been won.
Anything cheaper than what’s on offer is a waste of the customer’s money, because it won’t get the job done.
Once we’ve cut every corner, all that’s left is the brutality of less.
One slogan is: You’ll pay less than you should have, and waste it all.

Avoid false proxies,"They’re toxic, wasteful and a tempting trap.
It’s one of the most important topics in my newbook.
(And here’s a newpodcaston it).
We need proxies. You’re not allowed to read the book before you buy it or taste the ketchup before you leave the store. We rely on labels and cultural cues to give us a hint about what to expect. We do judge a book (and a condiment) by its cover, all the time.
And hiring and managing people is far more important and risky than buying ketchup. So we look for proxies that may give us a clue as to how someone will ultimately contribute to our project.
False proxies include: Height, race, gender, attractiveness, charisma in meetings, famous college, etc.
It’s easy to imagine that we don’t fall prey to these irrelevant signals, but a quick look at the height of elected officials makes it clear that we do–we keep picking the tall ones.
When building the Oakland A’s into a championship contender, Billy Beane discovered that every other team was using these sorts of proxies to scout who would be worth drafting. By finding an actual proxy, a useful one, he was able to assemble a skilled team on a budget.
Just because someone interviews well, is friendly, or looks like you doesn’t mean that they can do the work that needs to be done.
Now that we can measure so many things, we might as well put that to use. Attitude and skill are useful proxies, while the easy-to-measure stuff is simply an expensive and hurtful distraction.","June 5, 2023","False proxies, hiring, decision-making"
Volition and placebos,"If aplaceboheals your illness, does that mean it was all in your head in the first place? That you weren’t really sick, or didn’t really want to get better?
If expensive wine tastes better to you, but you can’t tell wine apart in a double-blind taste test, does that mean it doesn’t really taste better to you, or that you have shallow tastes?
Can luxury goods, spiritual practices or a change in the weather change our situation?
Knee surgery works for some people, and those people, apparently, had anactualinjury and the surgery fixed it. And yet,shamknee surgery (in which the patient is sedated, cut and stitched, but no internal changes occur) is just as effective as ‘actual’ knee surgery for certain physical ailments. Does that mean that those ailments weren’t real, or that the patient was not trying hard enough to get well?
Along the way, we’ve persuaded ourselves and others that our brains don’t matter so much, and that the stories in our lives are not nearly as important as the molecules.
And yet, every time we look closely, the opposite appears to be true.
Stories are a balm. And our brains are powerful, though not always (or even often) under our conscious control.

Productive assets and useful flows,"Assets are ownable. They are devices, skills, connections or properties that allow us to amplify our effort and do our work with more impact.
A drill press is an asset, so is your law degree. The permission you have to talk with your customers, the benefit of the doubt you get from your patients and the freedom to expand into a new territory are all assets. A movie studio owns volcano.com, decades after the movie was made. It’s an asset, a wasting one.
The projects we do create flows. We put in time or effort or cash, and something comes back. When the effort and resources we put in are rewarded with at least as much return as we expected, the flow is positive. It was worth the effort.
The next steps in figuring out our strategy (whether you’re a freelancer, a spiritual leader or a CEO) are:
Make a list of theassets. Put them in order of value to you and value to others. Are there some assets you’re hoarding that are going to waste? Some that might be worth selling or walking away from? Are there assets that will respond well to an investment of money, effort or learning?
Get really smart about theflows. Are you defending sunk costs, sticking with projects simply because that’s easier than leaving them behind? Which flows could be improved with focus and effort?
Hard choices today often lead to good outcomes later, and while today is real, we spend almost all of our lives living in later.","June 3, 2023","productive assets, strategic planning, positive flows"
Consider the WordWindow,"Computer adventure games were possible in the 1980s because of a bit of code called a ‘parser’. You could type, “pick up the axe” and the computer wouldunderstandthe phrase and follow your commands. In italics, because it didn’t understand anything, it simply broke your sentences into bits and changed the state of your inventory accordingly.
When faced with a parser, even a primitive one, many people did that homunculus thing and decided that the computer could understand every single thing you might type, like, “I’m thinking that having an axe in my inventory would be helpful,” or even, “let me tell you about my cousin…”
My first gig, at Spinnaker, was leading the team that built the original generation of illustrated computer adventure games (I got to work with Arthur C. Clarke and Ray Bradbury, which is a great story). We discovered early on that the parser was magical but not nearly as powerful as people hoped.
Sounds a bit like LLM and ChatGPT, forty years later.
The solution was to offer a convenient and simple approach, which is almost always the solution to a problem of confusion.
We created the WordWindow™ button. The gratuitous trademark symbol made it more powerful, apparently.
When you clicked that button, it gave you a list of the 25 most common or useful things you could type.
I think this is going to be a powerful bridge even now. For example, a “Summarize” button is going to lean into ChatGPT’s strengths, but it’s not something people might immediately jump to.
Broadening this concept, whenever you find the folks you seek to serve appear to be hesitating or confused, consider offering them a multiple choice option.

The 77% threshold,"When the gas car was first introduced, it couldn’t compete with horses. After all, we’d had thousands of years to optimize our systems around horseback, and this new technology was still nascent. Roads were rare, gas stations were scarce and the cars themselves were unreliable.
The same thing happened again when electric cars made a comeback a hundred years later. At first, they had limited range, limited space, low acceleration and charging was a hassle.
When a new technology arrives, it is almost always at a systemic disadvantage. If we wait until the new thing is better than the old thing, we’re taking a big risk.
That’s because we have competitors who will spend the time to learn the new tech, and more importantly, build systems around it. They will gain customers you may have trouble getting back. They have a head start that can last a generation.
Herbie Hancock started experimenting with electronic instruments a decade before many of his peers. That enabled him to create not one but two of the most successful jazz singles of all time.
If the local landscaping contractor sneers at electric weed whackers and leaf blowers because they’re not quite as cost-effective in the short run, they’ll probably lose some customers, and won’t develop what they need to know when the technology and systems catch up. And the new systemswillcatch up.
The same goes for media companies that are defending a model of expensive content that’s ad-supported, refusing to consider that it might not last. How much longer willVoguematter?
When there’s an iterative cycle of new technology, the systems can’t help but improve, and the tech is likely to as well.
When a new tech or system is 50% as effective as the old one, it’s our job to learn it and understand it.
And when it hits 77%, we ought to consider creating a new division, a new product line or a new approach that adopts it.
By the time it catches up, we’re either part of it or we’re too late.",,"technology adoption, systemic disadvantage, innovation strategy"
Should we assume rational goodwill?,"There’s often a choice between following the cultural dictates of a given group or seeking out demonstrable facts and the scientific method. Which do you expect most people would choose?
Which would you choose?
When we revert to a testable analysis of what works, we’re relying on the one thing that all humans share: reality. But cultural connection, peer pressure and the power of affiliation and status often short-circuit that analysis.
This happens so often that arguing about facts might not be the best way to make your point.
“Rational goodwill” is shorthand for, “If the analysis is testable, are you prepared to change your mind and accept the alternative that works?”
And yet, more often than we might expect, NASA engineers, doctors, political leaders and households would have to honestly answer that with a ‘no’.
It might be that culture isn’t something we awkwardly laid atop rational analysis. It might be the other way around.","July 31, 2023","Rational goodwill, cultural dictates, scientific method"
Pavlonian coincidence,"There are two kinds of coincidences.
The first is the one that we often talk about. It’s the make-believe magic of two things occurring that we didn’t expect to occur. When you and your long-lost college roommate end up randomly sharing adjacent bowling lanes when you’re 72–that’s a coincidence. When the world expert on the obscure Discs of Tron videogame finds a pristine example abandoned at the end of a driveway near his mom’s house…We invent all sorts of reasons for these events, but they’re simply random.
The other kind matters far more. This is when we get two unrelated incidents confused because they happened nearby in time. If you were drinking your first ever kombucha when you heard that your cat died, it might be that in the future, seeing a can of kombucha prompts you to be sad. The events are co-incident.
As our lives speed up and the number of inputs increases, it’s easier than ever to have events in proximity prompt instincts or expectations that are unrelated to what they actually created.
That’s one reason why marketers work so hard to have their products or ads show up in times of our lives when we’re likely to associate them with feelings that lead to consumption. It’s not a random coincidence, it’s simply an incident that was planned in advance.

There are problems all around us. People need housing, health care and food. They want delight, belonging and status.
When a company shows up in the marketplace with a product or service that people eagerly choose to buy, it’s possible to make a profit. If there are assets and other ways to offer something at a premium, a business can actually thrive.
But sometimes, a problem doesn’t lend itself to a private solution. Or, a private solution might simply be a low-cost commodity, something we need, but because it’s available from many sources, it might not actually be a good business for any given entity.

The Beatles and Taylor Swift,"When we’re in the middle of a cultural swirl, it’s normal to believe that everyone else is too.
That’s part of the magic of a cultural swirl–it’s our friends, our work, our world.
Most of these moments are actually tiny pockets. An episode of the much-talked-about TV show Succession was seen by about 3,000,000 people when it aired, compared to an episode of Gilligan’s Island or the Monkees, which reachedfifteen timesas many people in the US with each episode.
And the US, of course, is about 5% of the world.
The size of the swirl doesn’t have to change the way it makes us feel if we’re in the middle of it. If you were one of the half a million people at Woodstock, or the 7,000 who saw the Dead play in Binghamton, that moment belongs to you and the people there. But that doesn’t mean it’s universal. It might be important to the people there precisely because it isn’t.
Over time, the Beatles sold more than a billion dollars in albums. They made movies, transformed hairstyles, clothing and attitudes about generational shift. Their work connected people worldwide in a way that few cultural forces before them had and few have since.
And it probably felt just as exciting to see them live as it did to go to a Taylor Swift show.
It’s true that no Taylor Swift album has outsold the hit albums by Hootie & The Blowfish or Metallica. But the long tail has transformed the record business since its peak.
And the long tail keeps getting longer. The singular cultural touchstones of a generation or two ago are unlikely to be repeated. Our experiences with worldwide events or local performances are now much less likely to be uniform.

Confusion and delay,"Marketing is generally about action. Marketers seek to create the conditions for a change to happen, for people to accomplish their goals and to satisfy their needs.
But since 1950, some marketers have worked in a different direction. To sow confusion and doubt, and most of all, to seek delay.
In 1954, facing the real threat of peer-reviewed and clear evidence that smoking caused lung cancer, the cigarette industry startled pundits by acknowledging the research and then calling for more research.
“More research” is a brilliant (if evil) tactic. It resonates with people who embrace science (since it calls for more) and it also works for people who want the status quo to remain untouched (because it calls for later).
We’ve seen this playbook used again and again. In the face of reality, big companies simply stall. And they’ve discovered that when the problem is chronic, nuanced and complex, they can stall for a very long time.
Because we choose to not understand. We’d prefer to pretend that we can wait. We accept that maybe, more research will pleasantly surprise us.
As long as people don’t understand, the stalling works.
Spending more than a year working as a volunteer with hundreds of other people onThe Carbon Almanacgave me a chance to really understand what is happening to our climate. Not just to the weather (10 days in a row over 119 degrees in Phoenix)… to the climate. To see that the best time to act was thirty years ago, but now is all we have left.
It’s easy to be confused, but it’s not that difficult to understand. It’s all in thealmanac.
The new CEO of Shell just announced that the company is redoubling its efforts to produce ever more fossil fuels. Because there’s money to be made in the short-run. And because the public doesn’t see.

Goals and expectations,"[a note to a frustrated friend, just starting out on a long career]
There are three reasons that our goals might not be achieved. In order of palatability, they are:
Perhaps the goals are too lofty, too based on chance, unlikely for anyone to achieve, surrounded by barriers that are rooted in class or caste, or simply unrealistic.
If that’s the case, change expectations and/or pick different goals.
Or, perhaps the goals are useful, but we need more persistence, more time and some hard-earned lucky breaks along the way.
If so, be persistently patient.
Alas, if it’s not these two, the most likely reason is that we need to walk away from our expectations and our insistence that we’re already doing the work perfectly. It could be that we need to expend more effort than we hoped, develop new skills, find and embrace new strategies and develop a taste for the emotional labor that’s required to get from here to there.
Empathy, a cycle of skills improvement, developing new attitudes and showing up in service often accompanies the careers of people who get from here to there.
Ambition is insufficient.","July 19, 2023","goals, persistence, career development"
Appropriate tension,"Growth usually feels risky. The feeling is a protection mechanism, a way to avoid failure or even the fear of failure.
Of course, risk also feels risky (or at least it should). Differentiating between the two is difficult, which is why finding institutions, methods or coaches that have experience in the difference is valuable.

The good news,"What if there were a pipeline into your day, a series of emails or posts or feeds that had nothing but nice things, positive feedback and encouragement coming your way?
Amazingly, you could build something like that in just a few minutes and have it forever.
If the bad news (comments, drama and controversy) is simply manipulating you into a certain state without productive effects, consider turning it off.
There’s no obligation to help someone else’s business model. No requirement that the device in your pocket change your mental state for the worse. And no upside to allowing media companies to make a profit by dumping trash on your front yard.
There’s a growing body of data that shows that the growth of smartphones has also led to a significant decrease in optimism and life satisfaction, particularly among young people.

Raising the bar,"That’s not the same as raising the average.
With the advent of the high jump, the idiomraising the barbecame well understood: If you can’t jump over the bar that the current leader cleared, you don’t win.
But most of the innovations that change our culture don’t actually increase the simple linear measurements of the bar. They’re more likely to raise the average, to increase the performance of accepted mediocre output.
McDonald’s didn’t raise the bar in terms of the best food it was possible to be served in a restaurant, but they made roadside dining faster, cheaper and more reliable.
AI doesn’t raise the bar for illustration, copywriting or coding. But it certainly increases the average quality of a high school essay or the cheapest photo retouching or programming services.
Autotune can’t compete with Eva Cassidy, but it turned millions of singers into slightly more palatable recording artists.
Two traps worth avoiding:
The endless cycle of improvement means that every innovation that raises the average creates the conditions for a new sort of excellence.

Sufficient resolution,"Robert Johnson is known as the king of the Delta blues. One reason is that his small output was brilliant. The other, bigger reason is that therecordingsthat remain of his short life are among the earliest that sound good… most audio recordings from before 1936 sound antique and scratchy.
The Wizard of Oz is one of our great movies, and one of the oldest that people regularly watch today. One reason is that the production values of 1939 were just good enough to still feel professional today. The movies from just a few years earlier are jumpy, faded relics.
People can happily read a first-edition Agatha Christie mystery, but a book from 1700 is rarely read in the same way.
No one wants to see websites that were built in Geocities or pages from Prodigy today. But a blog like this one is still readable and fresh, even though it has a design that’s nearly a decade old.
When a medium hits sufficient resolution, future advances are nice, but they’re not essential. And once an industry realizes this, future investments in resolution begin to slow down. Of course, it’s difficult to tell if the resolution is sufficient until after the fact.

Customer traction is the hard part,"A new business is complicated. It involves weaving together suppliers, partners, customers, processes, technology, leases, employees, logos, capital and more.
Along the way, it’s easy to get distracted, but focusing on the hard parts is a useful way to move forward.
You could work hard on the logo, or double your supplier roster or, as I did once, spend time with your corporate lawyers brainstorming the way to make your terms of service more interesting.
There are endless tasks to be done in starting a new venture. But most of the tasks are necessary but insufficient. You can’t begin without them, but by themselves, they won’t create enough impact for your work to make a change happen.
And every new project must create change, or else it fails.
We spend our time focusing on the tasks because the tasks are known and do-able.
It’s a form of hiding.
Worth noting:
The hard part isn’t the thing that costs you the most money. If you can outsource the work to an expert and get that work done effectively, it’s not hard. It’s just expensive. You don’t need to build your own email server, you can rent one. And if you want to become a book publisher, it turns out that printing, typesetting, copyediting, legal work and the rest aren’t actually hard. There are people who are eager to do that for you.
The hard part involves customer traction. Can you find enough customers who will pay you a fair price and also choose to spread the word? Because if customers bring you customers, and those customers all generate more income than expenses, you have a useful project.

Who is undermining your brand?,"There’s a high-end grocer in a very expensive neighborhood of New York–and they focus all of their energy on Italian food.

And then a lazy brand manager decided to plaster “Sale-A-Bration” signs all over their windows. Is there anything less Italian than that?
Or perhaps it’s the front desk person who can’t be bothered to bring the extra energy that the architect, real estate professionals and builders brought to the hotel you just opened.
Or the paralyzed UI group in the software department who undermined the work of the new car’s designers.
Or the fearful security people at the bank who belie the hard work you’re doing on customer service by creating herculean barriers between your customers and the transactions they seek to execute.

The nuanced challenge of “The Regular Kind”,"In a breakthroughstudyby Alex Berke at MIT, she and her team showed that labeling a menu item asvegansignificantly decreased how many people would order it. In similar conditions, it turns out that more people choose exactly the same item if it doesn’t carry that label.
One conclusion people might take away from this study is that the brand name “vegan” carries a lot of baggage. We see that people generally like food without meat, but when it’s labeled as a particular sub-category, they avoid it.
Consider that in other studies, researchers have shown that when food without meat is listed as the default option, far more people will choose it. Simply shifting the choice from “on request” to the convenient, regular kind, dramatically increases selection.
But the real insight is that if a marketer wants to reach the masses,the regular kindbecomes worth understanding.
When Italian food was considered novel and was stocked in the ethnic aisle, marketers had to run commercials simply to persuade people that it was okay to serve spaghetti for dinner on Wednesdays. It didn’t really matter which kind, simply that it was normal.
An alternative is to seek the smallest viable audience instead, to create connected communities that change the status quo. The tiny symbols on many packaged goods that indicate kosher status are ignored by most people, but often closely inspected by enough small groups that use it as a certification of what they’re buying. When you can encourage a small group to look for something that the larger group doesn’t even see, it can shift how large producers (corporations, politicians, employers) treat the entire population.
While organizing a few is helpful to those seeking to create change, it also creates a risk for a brand that is comfortable with its position as a market dominator. They’re no longerleaders, because leaders make change happen and embrace opportunity. Instead, a brand that sees itself as the regular kind is relentless in seeking to serve everyone and offend no one. Which, inevitably, they will fail to do.
And so the creative destruction occurs that leads to a shift. A shift in what’s only available on request, on what’s stocked on eye level, and on what’s safe to serve at the big gathering.

The absence of proof,"Belief makes us human. Belief is our tool to dance with a possible future, confront our fears, and build community. Our personal taste and our preferences belong to us as well, helping us believe in ourselves.
For millennia, belief thrived in most parts of our lives. We didn’t need belief to know that fire was hot (it always is), but it certainly gave us hope and solace in the face of the unknown. And the unknown is where belief thrives
But resistance to knowing isn’t a useful habit. When Ignaz Semmelweis used statistics to prove that hand washing by doctors would save the lives of mothers giving birth, doctors who believed they knew better ignored it, causing countless deaths. When researchers showed that many ulcers are caused by bacteria, doctors who practiced with long-earned belief resisted the data for decades. And when experts in any field fight against research that might undermine their status, they’re doing their belief and those who trust them a disservice.
There’s more proof in the world than ever before, not less. It’s no longer, “I’ll believe it when I see it,” but instead, “I am confident enough to change my mind and informed enough to do the math and understand the concepts.” We have proof about mathematics, about black holes and about the efficacy of vaccines. We have statistical proof of what people click on and how humans respond in a double-blind test.
This doesn’t make belief less important. In fact, as proof shows up in one area, it simply gives us the opportunity to bring belief somewhere else, somewhere we can put it to good use. Personal taste, placebos and the way we dance with the unknown future are powerful ways to connect, to express ourselves and to find solace.

Belief is contagious,"Placebos work and placebos spread.
We’re wired to believesomething, but the specifics of what we believe often come from other people.
When there were a limited number of channels, mainstream ideas were the focus of our conversations, because the mainstream was all that was widely amplified. Someone might believe that the world was flat, or that the moon landings were faked, but that lived on the fringe. Pockets of odd beliefs.
One of the reasons that Mehmet Oz’s snake oil nostrums were so disturbing was that he took his mainstream reputation, added mass TV and legitimized fringe placebos to make a profit.
Now, thanks to the billion-channel universe, the mainstream has gone out with the tide and every belief can feel mainstream if you immerse yourself in it. You can surround yourself with people who are sure that birds aren’t real, or find a community to reinforce that the patent medicine you’re taking works. And that will increase its positive placebo effect.
Belief increases the efficacy of our practice, but touting an idea can also generate a profit for the touter. Sometimes those two things align, but often, the profit motive pushes them to where they are out of sync.

For customers vs to customers,"In the life of every enterprise, the moment arises when a choice has to be made: Are you hereforyour customers, to give them what they seek, or are you trying to do somethingtoyour customers, to squeeze out extra income?
This doesn’t mean that the only path is to keep lowering your prices. It’s entirely possible your customers want to pay a lot but get more than they paid for.
What it does mean is that you use your brand and your interface and your software and your network effect to come up with ways to serve people that they would miss if you were gone.
It’s not surprising that many companies are putting software and dark patterns and AI to work on things that improve their profit. But I’m not seeing as many instances of them doing the same thing to improve the experience and delight that their customers experience.
Amazon is testing a different way to show reviews on the products they sell.
It looks like this:
instead of like this:
It’s subtle, but it can make a very big impact on merchants, on their profits, and on what we buy.
In the new format, your brain sees the image of a star, but then it has to do the mental math of turning the number 4.6 into something with weight and emotional heft–abunchof stars.
In the old format, that work was done already. Our brains are much better at drawing emotional conclusions from this more concrete visualization. If you look at the two illustrations above, it certainly seems at first glance as though the second one is higher rated.
This new format means that higher-rated items won’t have as much of an advantage–which will push other vendors to buy ads and run coupons (which Amazon makes a profit on) instead of either gaming the reviews or actually making a better product.
When a company makes it hard to unsubscribe, or pushes needless options (“362 people are currently signing up for the insurance…”) or hustles people, they’ve forgotten the lesson that got them here in the first place.

The unsurprising confusion about ‘per capita’,"A car cut me off on the highway the other day. The car was going nearly 100 mph.
Was the car a new Porsche 911 GT3 or a used Toyota Camry?
The thing is, there are more than 1,000 times as many Camrys on the road. But our instinct is to pick the vivid and distinctive answer.
The per capita crime rate in rural areas is often dramatically (sometimes five or ten times) higher than it is in most cities.
On the other hand, Alaska has far more millionaires per capita than most people would guess. That’s because we underestimate the population, not because there’s a particularly large number of millionaires.
More people might lead to more instances, but what matters isn’t the absolute number, it’s the percentage. New York is an incredibly safe place to live.
We’re simply not naturally attuned to dividing what we notice by the chances we’ll see it… stories resonate without regard for the denominator.
Flying across the country is dramatically safer than driving there, but intuitively, it feels like the opposite must be true. And peer-reviewed medicine is far more likely to cure an illness than an anecdote will.

A local merchant adds a note to some receipts that says,Your awesome.
It’s tempting to speak up and point out that the sky comma is showing up where it shouldn’t. And missing when it might be helpful.
But language shifts, changing over time, and as we become ever more post-literate, it’s not hard to imagine that the apostrophe’s assigned role is ending. Greengrocers and others with pens have taken possession.
Sometimes, people throw in an extra apostrophe to sound smart. And sometimes, they simply give up because it’s not worth the trouble to figure out when or when not to use one.
Pedants will always pedant and try to defend the language, but the language changes whether we want it to or not.

Unstable equilibrium,"We’re testing a brand new way to host acharity auction, and I’m hoping you can check it out and even bid to supportBuildOn.
In this post, I want to take a moment to explain the attraction and risk of unstable equilibrium, and there’s also a fun contest at the end…
If you drop a marble into a metal bowl, it will roll to the bottom and stay there. Every time. This is reliable, predictable and stable. We know what to expect from systems that find one spot of equilibrium.
But sometimes, there isn’t just one state. A situation could go this way or that. A brilliant jazz quartet, a well-matched game of soccer and a canoe in a river are all examples of an unstable equilibrium. There’s tension. We’re fascinated and are drawn to how it unfolds.
Goodbids.orgis a project I’ve worked on for a few months with some friends. And we simply can’t predict how it’s going to turn out, so it’s time to test it in the real world.
Our goal is to re-imagine the charity auction. Most of the time, bidders in these auctions are looking for a bargain, which is out of sync with what the charity wants. The end result is often lackluster.
In Goodbids,every bid is also a donation. That means that the winner takes home a great prize, and all the other bidders get the satisfaction of knowing they made a useful and non-refundable donation directly to a charity that’s doing good work.
The unstable part? The nature of the auction means that the items being auctioned off will almost always go for a pricemuchlower than they’re worth. The charity gets more, the winner pays less.
And here’s thecontest: Until 4 pm NY time today, August 14, we’re inviting you to guess how much the final bidding will reach on the two items that are up for bid in our test run. The person with the best guess will get acollectible significance bee mugand some other loot.

After all, the very best time to understand an agreement is when you sign it, not later.

A vote for the boss and the owners of the institution where we do our work.

Hope and truth,"The candidate running for re-election offers truth. This is what I did, I would like to do it again. The candidate coming out of nowhere offers hope. We can’t know but we can imagine.
Kickstarter offers hope. No reviews, no tests, simply a promise of what might be.
Book publishers buy hope, so do venture capitalists. On the other hand, the typical commercial investor simply wants a repeat of what already was.
Some pharmaceuticals offer specific outcomes with known statistics…
Simple example: Early in my career as a producer and creator of non-fiction books, my proposals included finished layouts. It turned out that whatever I could have offered at this stage could never be as good as the publisher imagined could be created once I had their input… better to offer a blank page than the page we would actually produce. On the other hand, I couldn’t simply assert that the contents would be worth publishing–we had to offer examples and a track record.
The thing is, there’s never just truth, because we’re talking about the future. So we base our hope on what has come before.
And there’s never just hope. The hope is based on something that came before, some clue or hint or track record that makes us believe.
The hard work for the marketer is in choosing when we’ve established enough of a track record–but not too much.
And for the voter/consumer/investor, we get to choose what we seek, and what we offer. Confusing truth and hope doesn’t make it more likely we’ll succeed.","August 9, 2023","truth, hope, track record"

The gratuitous use of plastic,"At the dawn of the plastic age, it was a cheap substitute. The word “plasticky” is not a compliment.
Over time, the plastics industry developed new finishes, colors and most of all, cultural impact, and extra (wasted) plastic packaging was seen first as convenient, then as a sign of status.
I just got a lovely digital recorder in the mail. The thoughtfully-designed and well-constructed device weighs 6 ounces. The box it came in, on the other hand, is difficult to open and hard to re-use. It weighs 11 ounces.
The plastic in this box, and in so many other over-wrought packages, will never go away. It cannot be recycled. It will either end up burned or in the ocean or a landfill, where it will remain for more than a million years.
Gratuitous used to mean, “freely bestowed.” By overinvesting in something that’s not required, a marketer demonstrates confidence, status and power. But now, gratuitous means inefficient, grating and wasteful.
Marketers seek to tell a story of better. But better changes. Better might be more convenient, cheaper, efficiently designed, higher utility, more exclusive, mainstream, or simply fun. But better is no longer associated with wasteful.
There are a few questions where the answer is ‘plastic.’ But we’re all discovering that it comes at a real cost. Instead of raising the status of the companies that use it in marketing, it is now a lazy, shameful shortcut.
With surprisingly little effort, we can raise the bar on better.","August 5, 2023","plastic waste, marketing, environmental impact"

Anti-smart,"There’s a difference between intellectual and smart. A plumber is smart, they know how to do a skilled and effective job on the task at hand. Intellectualism isn’t about practical results, it’s a passion for exploring what others have said, though this approach is sometimes misused to make others feel uninformed or to stall.
If you want to know what the scholars have written, ask an intellectual.
And if you’ve got a problem worth solving, it might pay to ask a smart person.
And yet, if the GPS is broken and we need directions, sometimes we hesitate to ask a local. And if your computer isn’t working, swearing at it might be less effective than asking an IT pro.
There are a couple of reasons we might resist help from someone who is smart:
–It exposes us to change and all the emotions that come from that. If we insulate ourselves from useful insight, we can stay put, stuck, with no changes required.
–It can make us seem dumb in comparison. It might be better to live with the problem than be seen as someone who didn’t know about it.
Access to smart is easier than ever before. But we need to seek it out.","August 2, 2023","intelligence, practicality, resistance"
Choose your customers,"…choose your future.
It’s an odd way to think about your project, your job, your startup, but there’s little that matters more.
There are two key elements:
At one extreme is the first few years of Google’s growth. The salesforce didn’t matter–the customers showed up on their own, and the revenue engine was so powerful that they were easily replaced. Beyond that, the needs of the customers were aligned with Google’s vision.
Compare this to a landscaper who sets up a new business on a small island. Getting customers is a challenge, because all the residents who want a landscaper already have one–you’ll need to do some hard work to get people to switch. And then, the customers you get might want something impossible, and are hoping to pay as little as possible for it. And worse, they may get satisfaction (inappropriately) out of mistreating a vendor they feel power over.
The goal is to have a business where the customers you have enable you to build the organization you want to build. To look forward to finding and serving new customers. And to create a tailwind so that early customer success earns you a chance for more customer success.
The first thing to do when thinking about starting a project, before you invest in systems design, infrastructure or fancy tools, is to practice getting some customers. And the second thing to do is to find out what it’s like to delight or disappoint those customers.
Customer traction is just about the only thing all successful organizations have in common.

Solving invented problems,"Some problems, when well solved, lead to making things better.
Some problems give us a chance to get back on course.
And some problems are opportunities to be generous.
But many of the problems that we seek to solve are actually invented, and maybe we could benefit by simply walking away.
There are two interesting kinds of invented problems:
First, it might be a situation, not a problem. You’re stuck on an elevator. The repair people have been called. They will come when they come. There’s no way for you to make anything better… there’s no available solution to your current predicament–it’s a situation and the only thing to do is wait.
The second kind is a problem that’s so trivial that solving it will have little impact. We feel it looming and lend it our anxiety and focus simply to keep our mind off the other problems, the ones that matter.","September 30, 2023","invented problems, situations, trivialities"

Thoughts on the manual,"We have more ways to offer instructions than ever before, but it’s not obvious that we’re getting better at it. Not just the operator’s manual, but every way we have to teach and offer instructions… Some (uncategorized) things to consider:
The first manual I created, in 1983, was for eight year old kids. I was an amateur. You can learn by doing.",,"manual, instructions, teaching"
The Jenga situation,"When an organization first sets out to have an impact, it discovers that it has no customers, no clients, no constituents. So it shows up, it makes an offer and it listens.
The early days are exciting. Customers are seen and heard and served. Variations are created and value is produced as problems are solved.
In the early days, the most celebrated employees are the ones who figure out what someone needs and then determines a way to fill that need.
Once the organization gains traction, it’s possible that a short-term profit maximizer will join the team. They push to treat the customers as replaceable flanges, almost identical, income opportunities to be processed. And the employees? They are expenses, not part of a team.
Kids play a game called Jenga. In it, identical wooden sticks are built into a tower, and you win the game by removing sticks without having the tower fall over.
It can seem like the fastest way for a stable business to increase profits is simply to remove some sticks. Process more flanges with fewer expenses. Lower overhead, measure the easy stuff, do it faster.
A simple service business example to prove the point:
Labcorp had a valuable idea: blood tests at scale, well-priced and convenient for doctors and patients. A nationwide chain meant that doctors didn’t have to wonder about instructions being understood. Offices in medical parks meant that patients didn’t have to go to the hospital for something that hardly needed a hospital. A large number of patients would mean that the organization would have the resources to build better calendaring and reporting software.
And then what?
Take out some Jenga pieces. Why bother with a receptionist when you can staff the entire facility with just one tech? If people have to wait an hour or two, no big deal. Don’t worry so much about turnover–simply give people too much to do, and if they quit, hire someone else. Customer service? Well, you can put up forms and offer surveys, but there’s no need to actually read them…
The Jenga situation is contagious. Once a competitor starts doing it, there’s pressure from short-term shareholders for you to do it as well. The profits that motivated growth become the entire point, a race to the bottom with no winners.
But then, often when one-too-many Jenga pieces are removed, or when technology shifts, the tower gets too shaky and someone else builds a competitor that starts the process all over again.
The biggest challenge a marketer at a big company faces is the specter of industrial short-term thinking. Going along with the bean counters might be the worst marketing mistake you can make. Beans aren’t the point of the organization, they’re a side effect.
We spend too much time dealing with shaky towers.

More vs. better,"If every building in the shopping district in a big city was owned by one landlord, rents would go up. So would the prices of everything sold. The landlord would keep a significant percentage of each store’s profits and innovation would suffer as well.
Google’smonopolyis real.
They pay Apple more thana million dollars an hourto be the default search engine on phones. It’s more profitable for Apple to threaten to build a search engine than it is for them to actually run one. Google overpays for the default status because their hegemony gives advertisers fewer options. And by controlling the flow of attention across the web, they can dictate how websites work and what our experience is online.
Ever since Adam Smith began writing about capitalism, it’s been understood that monopolies are a defect in the structure of free markets. Locking in an advantage gives the monopolist the power to ignore its customers and we all suffer as a result.
A company grows by getting ever better at serving its customers, its vendors and its employees.
A company becomes a monopoly by becoming ever better at becoming a monopoly.
Few companies have done a better job of marketing the benefits of their monopoly than Google. They rarely charge their users, but offer free software and engaging stories instead. But they have relentlessly grabbed more and more of our attention, and used it to create a sinecure that costs all of us. It’s not justecosia,duckduckgoandkagithat are paying for this monopoly.

While standing on one foot,"Make it easy! they insist.
One of the longest-running direct response ads of all time was for a piano playing course. For more than forty years, people mailed in money for a simple, fast way to impress their friends by playing the piano. They sold a lot of manuals, but I’m guessing not many people actually learned to play.
And every year, there are new electronic devices, pills and procedures that promise to help people lose weight or get fit without trying very hard.
Of course, the one-foot shortcut fails. Almost every time.
Not only don’t we learn anything, but we waste the time and the money we spent standing impatiently on one foot.

Two sides of “a big deal”,"Many businesses thrive by helping people deal with projects that feel like they have high stakes. A kid’s first haircut, the offsite storage of data backup, an upcoming family reunion, a medical procedure or the inscription on a sentimental piece of jewelry or watch.
But, if the inevitable glitch or failure arises, we’re inclined to remind the customer that in the scheme of things, it’s not such a big deal.
Of course it is. You reminded them of that over and over when you were making the sale.
When things don’t work, it’s not helpful to try to minimize the impact. In fact, you’re far more likely to make progress if you remind the customer just how much it mattered to you to get it right, and how you feel about letting them down.

Getting to no,"“Yes” is magical. It brings possibility and forward motion.
But it’s almost impossible without “no” and no can be just as frightening.
First, there’s the no of “I can’t go for that.” The no of refusing to race to the bottom, the no of avoiding the selfish hustle, the no of walking away from instincts or shortcuts that strip others of dignity and possibility. This is the no that creates our standards.
And then, there’s the no of “I need to be a meaningful specific, not a wandering generality.” What Zig meant by this phrase was that the guts of focus and specialization are useful when we put ourselves on the hook and do something that matters instead of simply pleasing whoever is sitting right in front of us right now.
When we offer a generous “no” to someone we care about, we honor our work and their role in it. We care enough to offer them insight about the change we seek to make–and to tell them the truth about what we can’t do at the same time that we’re celebrating what we can do.

The alternative is a project. A project begins with a protest that ends with, “we’ll be back tomorrow, and we’re bringing our friends.”
A project is impatiently persistent. It plays a longer game, one that can outlast the status quo.

Convenience and scams,"The scam era is upon us. Aided by AI, borderless currency and the internet of things, there are more people than ever before making a living hustling to steal, impersonate, defraud and otherwise violate our trust.
When the world was inconvenient, this was difficult. The banker met with you in person, so did the charitable fundraiser and your second cousin.
The very convenience we’ve leaned into–digital interactions, quick logins, caller ID–are now being used against us.
Here’s a quick checklist to keep in mind:
–if someone calls you from an institution, don’t assume they’re calling from that institution. Call them back on the main switchboard. Caller ID isn’t real anymore, not when it matters.
–if someone emails you about something urgent, get their phone number and call them. Don’t hesitate to ask questions and don’t send money. The ‘sender’ field isn’t real anymore either.
–it’s now cheap and easy to impersonate someone’s voice and to create digital photographs and videos that seem real.
–don’t use Paypal’s friends and family button to buy things online.
–Don’t buy gift cards (period) but especially… don’t buy gift cards for someone who reaches out to you.

Just looking,"Lots of people go to the beach but very few get in the water.

It goes without saying,"A phrase that’s been showing up recently is, “no pressure.” It usually comes in a pitch letter of some sort, written by someone who isn’t in a position to exert any pressure.
So why say it?
It’s a bit like, “while supplies last.” And “to be honest…” which is perhaps the most self-negating of the three.

When we get better at something, it is preceded by a moment of incompetence. In that moment, we’re not exactly sure how to do it better, but we realize that the way we’d been doing it wasn’t nearly as useful.
It can be something prosaic–I learned last week that I’d been preheating my dosa pan for too long, and that’s why (paradoxically) they weren’t becoming crispy. Years of consistent behavior overturned in one moment. Or it can be something more profound, changing our perceptions of others and ourselves.

Tricked (again),"If you knew then what you know now, would you have made the same decision?
In the last fifty years, more than 25,000,000 Americans have died prematurely due to cigarette smoking. Worldwide, it’s significantly higher. That’sfiftytimes as many U.S. citizens as died in World War II.
How did cigarette marketers manage to keep selling their product for decades once the danger was known? And are we able to see how many industries use this playbook to sell us on actions that are against our interests?
The key drivers of widespread marketing impact are status and affiliation.
The status of doing what James Dean or another movie star did in a movie. The status of a rock star or a spy.
Women didn’t smoke much in public until a well-publicized stunt had society women causing a scandal by smoking while walking in the Easter Day parade on Fifth Ave. in New York. It shouldn’t work, but it does. Status cues.
And affiliation? Peer pressure, the freedom of the Marlboro Man, the social requirements created by the high-status folks who required it… No teenager wants to be left behind by their peers.
The same thing happened with the seemingly less fatal but also expensive meme of a diamond engagement ring. Using similar tactics, DeBeers created status expectations and cultural standards that pushed people to spend billions of dollars on small rocks.
And, surprisingly, again with gas stoves. I got tricked by this, as did millions of others. Walking away from the affiliation of what our parents did (those spiral electric heating elements) to the power and status of a gas stove that seemed right out of Prometheus.
Of course, traditional diamond mining is brutal, dangerous and dirty. And we now know, and have known for a long time, that gas stoves in a kitchen or apartment are needlessly dangerous, particularly to children and others that breathe.
And yet we resist! We don’t want to give up that thing that is part of our identity, that we grew up with or aspire to acquire. It doesn’t really matter that there are elegant and beautiful alternatives to the stones, or that an induction cooktop works even better than gas. It’s the story and the way it was sold to us (they hustled Bob Hope’s writers to give him jokes where the punchline was “now we’re cooking with gas”).
The status quo is resilient. Almost everyone in the jewelry business or the appliance business will do fine (perhaps even better) if we switch. Unless you own a diamond mine or a pipeline company, switching to a more resilient, safer and kinder alternative is probably good for business.
But the stories persist. The stories about status, about affiliation and the risk of the new.

Freelancing, creating, and leading can feel solitary, even lonely, but they don’t need to be.
And most of all, we can get better.
Better together.
Our best work is far more likely to happen when we have peers. You’re likely to become the average of the people you spend professional time, so choosing your cohort is best not left to chance.
More people are working away from the office than ever before, but we all miss the best moments of solidarity and connection that can happen around the mythical water cooler. Finding your people and leading together can change everything.
There are 500 of us now, in a community of practice. It’s an evolving, focused community of professionals. Around the world and around the clock, people who care about their work and about each other. We’re only enrolling 1,000 people this week.
It costs $20 a week and the first week is free if you use the code TOGETHER.
I hope you can check it out.","September 14, 2023","community, connection, freelancing"
The MVP and fear,"The minimum viable product is a powerful way to find out if your solution is going to find a market.
Bean-to-bar chocolate in the US didn’t happen because someone raised millions of dollars, built a factory and got shelf space at the A&P. It happened because John Scharffenberger made a small batch of chocolate by hand and brought it to a farmer’s market. That was enough to discover if people wanted what he had in mind.
InThis is Marketing, I talk about its cousin, the smallest viable audience. This isn’t a ‘target’, because we’re not hunting. Instead, this is a segment that you’ve chosen to delight. To delight so much that they’ll return and perhaps spread the word.
The fear comes in several forms:

Practical philosophy,"Engineering is the powerful practice of being able to deliver artifacts that do what they’re supposed to. Bridges that don’t fall down, software that runs, IV lines that don’t get infected.
But if we want to create something, it helps to know what it’s for.
That simple question, “what’s it for?” is essential to ask and easy to avoid.
If you’re about to spend time and money and effort to create something, how will you know if it worked? What needs to happen to make it worth it?
And of course, not just bridges. Meetings. Memos. A family gathering.
And yes, marketing.

Widespread resistance,"Steve Pressfield definesResistanceas the inertia, stories and excuses we manage to create to avoid powerful or creative work.
Writer’s block, procrastination, overconfidence, or a belief in un-delivered talent are all symptoms of resistance.
Knowing that it has a name helps us dance with it. We can’t make it go away (the more important and useful our contribution, the more likely it is to appear) but we can learn to use it as a compass.
In the last few years, though, resistance has been spreading as a cultural norm. Ennui, eco-anxiety, marketplace exhaustion and justified frustration with systems of caste and injustice have all amplified resistance. It feels like culture and tech have both hit a cul de sac, and it’s easier to simply chill out.
This serves the defenders of the status quo, but distracts us from the journey.
If history is any guide, this is precisely the moment we need the urge to create. To imagine something better, to ship work that matters, and to lead.","September 11, 2023","Resistance, creativity, cultural norm"
Digital shortcuts and cognitive load,"I used to drive 200 miles to Boston once a week or so.
After a few trips on the highway, my subconscious figured out that getting behind a few trucks for the entire ride enabled me to spend four hours without using much conscious effort on driving.
Every day, we make decisions. These require effort, and there’s probably a finite amount of energy available for these focused choices.
That’s why our digital habits matter. Not to save us five or ten minutes a day, but to save us from a few hundred unimportant decisions that break our flow.
For example, if instead of trying to come up with a unique and original password every time you use a new service, you use a password manager, your load just got lighter.
If you adopt a file naming system (each version gets a number, from 1 to X, so the latest file always has the highest number before its name) then you won’t hassle with trying to figure out which is the most recent version.
If you use the sidebar in your file finder to put shortcuts to the folders you use often, you won’t burn energy finding your way through nests of folders, again and again.
When I worked at Yahoo, they were embarrassed to share the fact that the most clicked-on button on the entire site was the Yahoo logo (which did nothing on the home page) and the most searched-for term in their search box was also “Yahoo.” People hadn’t figured out what bookmarks were yet, or decided to simply keep clicking around until something worked.
Ten minutes today will save you from 30 decisions every day forever.","September 10, 2023","Digital shortcuts, cognitive load, decision-making"
The Santa problem,"An echo chamber is created by a marketer to assemble a group of people who are insulated from conventional discourse.
It can happen to sports and music fans, to investors, to companies that have confidence in their view of the world, or to social or political gatherings.
We support an echo chamber when we can gain status or find tribal affiliation by adhering to its rules.
The resilience of the cultural norm happens as a result of insulation from reasoned discourse and is amplified by threats to status or affiliation.
The tooth fairy myth is a fairly benign myth, but, like Santa, it’s mostly reserved for kids. When leaders seek to gain power and profit by organizing and maintaining an echo chamber, it begins to have negative side effects.
You’ll know you’re in one when:

No lunging,"I’ve been working hard on my juggling (actual juggling, not metaphorical juggling).
The secret, as I wrote about inThe Practiceis the throwing, not the catching. If you get the throws right, the catches are easy.
The way to focus on the throws is simple but culturally difficult: Errant throws don’t earn a lunge.
Let them drop.
Simply stand there and watch them drop.
Realize that the problem isn’t that you didn’t lunge. The problem was that your throws were off.
It’s hard to do this at work (here’s the metaphor part). There are lots of rewards for heroic saves at work. But heroic saves undermine the desire to build better systems.
If it’s worth having a better system, it might be worth shutting down the entire plant when the system breaks.",,"juggling, throws, systems"
The paradox of insular language,"We often develop slang or codewords to keep the others from understanding what we’re saying. Here’s anexample(thanks BK) of the lengths that some are going to be able to talk about Chinese politics.
Of course, if you come up with a concealed enough code, the people you’re talking to won’t have a clue what you mean. If it’s in the language, it must be shared. This was the problem with the Cone of Silence, used by Maxwell Smart to have top secret conversations with the Chief. It worked so well, the Chief couldn’t hear him.
Language only works when other people know what you’re saying, but once they know, it’s likely that the others can figure it out.
So why bother?
It turns out that vernacular elevates those that are using it as much as it isolates the ones who don’t understand it.
When we speak as insiders, we become insiders.
A practical way to create tribal affiliation is to amplify insular language.","September 7, 2023","insular language, slang, tribal affiliation"
The Big-O conundrum,"In computer science, Big-O notation is a way of talking about what happens to a solution method when the inputs start to increase.
For example, sorting numbers is an easy problem when there are only five or six, but when you have to sort 5,000, a totally different algorithm is needed.
Business models have this baked in. Running a podcast app doesn’t get more difficult if you list more podcasts or have more users. But running a food bank gets exponentially more difficult when your inputs and outputs increase.
If you’re running a conference where you expect one or two people to arrive every few minutes, hiring someone to check them in is a pretty obvious move.
But if you expect five or six people at a time, you’ll need to hire at least that many people or it all backs up.
But what about the big convention where thousands of people might arrive at once? In that case, your Big O problem requires you to do away with the check-in altogether and have people do their check-in online, in advance.
Mom-and-pop businesses work because there’s mom and there’s pop. But when the inputs start to go up, when the business begins to scale, it’s really hard to simply hire another mom. Pushing the old algorithm too far ends up with a crisis–we need to invest in process before we need it, not when the emergency strikes.
There are Big-O problems in marketing, in sales, in customer service, in finance, in production and in compliance. There’s nothing wrong with winging it–until there is.","September 6, 2023","Big-O notation, scalability, business process"

But what if it’s voluntary?,"For more than 130 years, we’ve celebrated Labor Day in the US and Canada. And May Day has been around about as long.
Around here, it’s become mostly a seasonal marker, but it was founded to devote just a day to something that deserves much more… to commemorate and celebrate the workers who sacrifice and toil to build.
Everyone needs to work, but now, more people than ever have the privilege to choose which sort of work they’re going to do.You have to work somewhere, but it doesn’t have to be here.
And I think it’s fair to say that just about every person reading this blog has a job that would be unrecognizable to someone working when Labor Day was first celebrated. In fact, many of these jobs are now unrecognizable to people from just 15 years ago.
Only 9% of the office workers in Manhattan go to their office five days a week now.
Add AI to the mix and we’re seeing another shift, one that’s happening faster than any that came before.
At the same time, many of the jobs that people get paid for have analogues where people do these jobs for fun. Amateur violin players, volunteer editors at Wikipedia, people who volunteer to help build houses or feed the hungry.
Is it labor if we get to choose?
Far too many people are being left behind as the market for our effort bifurcates. Too many people are indentured or stuck, under-appreciated and underpaid.
If we’re lucky enough to have a choice, perhaps we should choose wisely.

Informed consent (rarely is),"Adults make choices and live with the consequences.
No one else should tell us what flavor of ice cream we prefer, or what career to choose. We’re good at knowing what we want.
In practice, this works really well for certain kinds of decisions. But when we add the network effect, profit-seeking industrial entities, statistics, long-term impact and side effects, it often falls apart.
Few people with terminal lung cancer made a fully informed decision when they started smoking cigarettes decades ago. Millions of teens who got hooked on a Juul certainly didn’t. We’re tempted to take the “free” case of bottled water that the local market is offering, without considering what’s going to happen to those bottles when we’re done with them. And while it’s easy to overregulate the testing and distribution of pharmaceuticals, it’s even easier to underregulate them.
There’s no right answer, there’s simply a spectrum.
Ideally, we’d each be able to make smart, long-term decisions with accurate information. I consider myself pretty rational, but, like most people, I don’t do a longitudinal study before taking a pill or buying a new product. We use buzz, hype and status to make decisions without statistics or peer-review.
Society might not know the ideal answer about where to draw the line between individual choice and community standards, but it’s worth asking the questions. Are people likely to be misled, confused or tricked into taking actions that hurt themselves and others? Are there incentives in place for consent to be skipped, or  profits to be made when people are not fully informed? Are there bugs in our human decision-making processes that are likely to be hacked by organizations that have a different goal than we do? Are there public health implications that have more impact than the benefits to an individual?
Like microeconomics, classic marketing theory happens in a vacuum, not the real world. To put it into widescale practice, we need to think hard about the impact of millions of decisions, often made without clarity or perspective.","September 3, 2023","Informed consent, decision-making, public health"
The empathy of useful feedback,"When a friend shows you work in progress, your best contribution is to imagine the point of view and preferences of the person it is being created for. “I don’t like it,” isn’t useful, because it’s not for you. “I could imagine that someone who wants x, y or z would be looking for…” is much more helpful.
You don’t have to be three years old to be a toy designer, and you don’t have to be three to give useful feedback on a new design.
On the other hand, when a friend shows you something that’s finished, the most important thing you can do is find two or three truthful and positive things to say. When someone trusts you to share their work, and cares enough about the world to bring the work forward, that’s already two things worth applauding.","September 2, 2023","empathy, feedback, design"

Confronting consciousness,"Everyone knows what it is to be conscious, and we imagine that other people are also aware. That we have a voice in our heads, apparent agency and free will, a little person inside who is commenting, making decisions and in charge.
We’re not sure if dogs have this, and we’re pretty sure that sunflowers aren’t having deep philosophical misgivings about this year’s harvest. We’re very sure we have it, though.
But other than a few philosophers, we mostly avoid considering the nature of the most vivid part of our days. The noise in our heads that can narrate joy and prolong and amplify stress.
AI is here now. And AI requires us to get clear about what’s actually going on in my head (and yours).  Dennett’s work on theIntentional Stanceis worth considering:
Here is how it works: first you decide to treat the object whose behavior is to be predicted as a rational agent; then you figure out what beliefs that agent ought to have, given its place in the world and its purpose. Then you figure out what desires it ought to have, on the same considerations, and finally you predict that this rational agent will act to further its goals in the light of its beliefs. A little practical reasoning from the chosen set of beliefs and desires will in most instances yield a decision about what the agent ought to do; that is what you predict the agent will do.
It’s easier to win a game of chess if you imagine that the person you’re playing against is playing a game of chess. The rook doesn’t ‘want’ anything, but if we imagine the person who moved it does, we can play with more ease.
We give the driver of a car in the other lane or the person in a negotiation the consciousness we imagine that we have. It’s a powerful shortcut to survival, and might even be the way we ended up deciding we were conscious.
Because we might not be. There’s plenty of fascinating work on the fact that free will is an illusion, and that the voice in our head happensafterwe’ve already made a decision.
It’s clear to most people who have used AI that it can’t possibly have consciousness, but it’s also human to imagine that it does. I can’t use chatgpt for more than three minutes without imagining that there’s a weird little person inside. I know what it’s doing, but that doesn’t help me interact with it.
It has no free will. It’s not conscious. There areturtles all the way down.
My guess is that we’ll revert to our habits and take an intentional stance with AI. Perhaps, though, this might be a moment to think hard (whatever that means in a world without active consciousness) about the fact that we might be exactly like an AI… that we’re nothing but wet electricity, and the intentional stance is an evolutionary hack, the product of living in a complicated world, not the cause of it.
If our brains areembeddingsplus probabilities… if what we are doing is processing inputs and creating outputs, that might be all there is.And that could be fine. If it helps us find peace of mind and acceptance of our situation, it could end up being a net positive.
It could be that when we drop the story and simply focus on what is in front of us, we’re able to make the impact we seek. The noise in our heads might just be noise.","October 31, 2023","Consciousness, AI, Free Will"
The 2 x 4 lessons,"You’ll need two 8-foot boards and six five-gallon buckets. Each board is a standard 2 x 4, about two inches by four inches in size. And the bucket is about two feet deep.
The first lesson is simple: Put the board on the floor and have a colleague walk from one end to the other.
Now, put it across three buckets and try again.
It should be clear that the fear is all imagined. We don’t typically have trouble walking on a board that’s nearly four inches wide. But the buckets change our narrative about risk.
The second lesson: Put the first board back on the floor and place another board alongside it, about 30 inches apart.
Now, have a second colleague walk on one board while the first takes a walk on their board. It’s do-able, but awkward.

Big science,"To win a Nobel prize a hundred years ago, you might only need a legal pad and a few pencils.
Today, it takes millions of dollars, scores of people and many years of effort.
That’s because the most straightforward problems have been solved.
One side effect of this inevitable shift is that many parts of science have become bureaucratic and industrialized. Most people who work in most organizations that do science simply do their jobs. That’s a good thing, because it can lead to coordinated, stepwise progress at scale. But it’s also a problem, because it puts a premium on being right, and creates a fear of being wrong.
But innovation–in the arts, in science, in business–is all about being willing to be wrong, because innovation requires missteps. They’re not a bug, they’re a feature.
Open systems, loosely coordinated networks and laptops are changing this. Now, it’s possible for tiny teams to have significant impacts on the entrenched power structures. As a result, the incentives shift. Now, a tiny team has little benefit in being just a cheap cog in a big system, and a huge upside for challenging conventional wisdom with new insights.","October 28, 2023",science innovation bureaucracy
"Small groups, well organized","And those are the two challenges of anyone seeking to make an impact.
First, we get distracted by the inclination to make the group as big as we can imagine. After all, the change is essential, the idea is a good one. It’s for everyone.
Except that’s a trap. Because a group that’s too large cannot be coherent or organized.
Or perhaps, we blink and settle for a group that’s too small. Change requires tension, and if our group is so small that it’s comfortable at all times, we are probably avoiding making an impact.
And well organized? That’s the persistent, generous work of creating the conditions for deep connection.
When in doubt, focus on how to organize the folks you already have. Find a way to give them the tools for them to tell the others. Build a resilient loop, one that gets more organized and powerful as you grow.

Trouble in the grey zone,"In many creative industries, there’s a similar pattern.
When the stakes are very low, most creators produce things that are fairly banal and ordinary. Part of that is the law of large numbers, but it’s mostly our personal cultural resistance to leaning too far into weird stuff. And so the vast majority of YouTube videos, Spotify tracks, potluck dinner contributions and craft fair items are copycats.
When more time or money is required, we actually see the percentage of creative work go up. I think this might be because the effort and risk separates the vast sea of hobbyists from the committed creator. This is where we find the solo chef with a strip mall restaurant, the indy record label, the art school movie project or the avant-garde composer who hires a small group to perform. Netflix demonstrates this small-budget magic on a good day.
But then we enter the grey zone. This is where the rents for the big restaurant are high, the budget for the film is in the tens (or hundreds) of millions and the record label has decided to really push on a particular artist. This is the moment when more creativity is the only appropriate economic plan. Why? Because if your goal was to go straight down the middle, you didn’t need to risk all that money.
Instead, cultural, financial and corporate pressure all conspire to push the creator to do precisely the wrong thing. The dotted line is where we should be, but we often ride the boring road all the way down.

Late-stage technocrats,"Water flows downhill, and tech solves the easy problems first.
After the launch of Amazon and Google, when smartphones reached critical mass, an easy problem to solve involved bridging information with stuff. So you could use your phone to summon a car, a case of beer, a dog sitter or just about anything that someone with resources might want to get, with convenience.
It took little in the way of insight, leadership or extraordinary effort for these things to unfold. If you didn’t build that app, someone else was going to. The business model existed, the funding was available and the pattern was there to be matched.
And it’s tempting to defend the easy shortcuts that technology exposes. “It’s too expensive for us to moderate…” or “the market will sort itself out” or “We need to hire the obvious person to do this work…”
Sometimes, though, humans show up to bend the curve of technology. They push against the conventional wisdom, avoid the obvious paths, and take responsibility for the impact of their work.
Kheytiis an example of this. Patient capital might not be as seductive as the next obvious step in tech’s evolution, but it matters.
This leads to an often under-asked question:What is technology for?
If we’re simply conduits for the evolution of tech in all its forms, bystanders and witnesses who might profit if we’re standing in the right place at the right time, that path is well-lit. People with capital and influence can make pronouncements about the utility of this approach, and how humans should merely step aside and applaud…
Or perhaps we can show up to bend the curve.
We can decide that technology exists to create opportunity, to help people find resilience, meaning and connection. We can realize that technology changes the status quo, and that change is up to us. Perhaps the tech industry can eagerly accept boundaries, responsibilities and obligations that match the leverage at their disposal.

Emotional labor and its consequences,"Forty years ago, Arlie Russell Hochschild wrote about emotional labor. The work that frontline employees had to do (especially women) in managing and expressing emotions as part of their job. She talked about how exhausting it was for flight attendants to show up with a smile, even when they didn’t feel like it.
Emotional labor is the opposite of the industrial economy’s task-based, measured output. Even if we don’t dig ditches, the offer for a certain kind of work was: Process this pile of papers and we don’t care whether you like (or pretend to like) your job. The labor is the easily measured stuff.
But AI and mechanization have turned this sort of task work into a race to the bottom. If you don’t bring emotional labor to the task, it’s probable that you’re engaged in a race to the bottom. The piecework and easily measured ‘real’ skills are soon automated or outsourced or diminished in value.
Emotional labor has become a competitive advantage. Our commitment to showing up as a human, even (especially) when we don’t feel like it is precisely how we create value. And it’s this human work that helps us feel seen and valued as well.","October 22, 2023","Emotional labor, competitive advantage, human work"
Complex or complicated?,"Complicated problems have a solution, and the solution can often be found by breaking the complicated portions into smaller pieces.
And complicated problems often have an emotional component, because there are parts of the problem we don’t want to look at closely, or deal with personally.
If you’re lucky enough to be handed a complicated problem, know that effort and guts can often get you where you’re going.
If it’s not a problem, it might be a situation. A complicatedsituationhas no clear solution, no win-win, no easy way forward. It’s simply a situation to be dealt with.
But this is very different from acomplexproblem.
Complex problems aren’t actually problems at all. They are non-determinate systems, systems that change based on how we engage with them. Push on one part of a complex problem and a different part will change the system. Healthcare, climate and technology systems are all complex problems.
When facing a complex problem, it helps to embrace the fact that we’re dealing with a system that shifts over time. One where the rules and the solutions evolve in non-predictable ways.

The shifting status of more data,"How do we know if we’re doing a good job?
In some fields, it’s always been pretty easy to tell. Either the building falls down or it doesn’t. Either the car starts after you charge the battery or it’s still dead. We can ask easy questions about how long it took or how much it cost.
But endeavors with crisp measurements often don’t attract people looking for a different sort of work. At many schools, more folks sign up for humanities than engineering.
Lately, more data is showing up in fields where it was elusive. Not just the efficacy of medical approaches, but the user satisfaction or time spent on creative endeavors or the stickiness and yield of educational approaches.
And closer to home for many, public health. We can actually tell with a great deal of granularity the impact of things like hand washing or placebos.

"The slog, the hobby and the quest","Here’s a simple XY grid to help you think about your next project, freelance career or startup:
All too common are ‘fun’ businesses where someone finds a hobby they like and tries to turn it into a gig. While the work may be fun, the uphill grind of this sort of project is exhausting. If it’s something that lots of people can do and that customers don’t value that much, it might not be worth your time. Taking pictures, singing songs or playing the flute are fine hobbies, but hard to turn into paying jobs.
On the other hand, in the top right quadrant, there’s endless opportunity and plenty of work for people who can do difficult (unpopular) work that is highly valued by customers who are ready to pay to solve their problems. A forensic accountant gets more paid gigs than a bagpipe player.
When you choose to take on a real problem that involves difficult work, but you’re serving a customer base that has few resources, thank you. Your quest is going to be a long one, but if you believe in the impact you’re creating, this can be a useful way forward.
And in the bottom right quadrant is a professional athlete or another gig where if you actually are the best in the world, you’ll do fine. Just know what you’re getting into before you start.The Dipis real.","October 17, 2023","Project planning, Freelance career, Value creation"
Judgment,"AI pushes us to do what we actually get paid to do: make decisions.
Craft used to drive our hours or even days. Get the pen lines just right. Source the Letraset. Get your instrument in tune. Sweat the details, because the details are everything.
Now, I can choose from 1,000 typefaces, and they’re all optically correct. Autotune has transformed commercial music, and the new AI grammar tools make it trivially easy to make edits or find errors.
The part of us that’s focused on getting it done so we can move on to the next thing accepts the defaults and settles for what the algorithm offers.
That ignores the real work. Taking ownership of the decision.

Reclaiming agency pushes us away from, “I’m just doing my job,” and into, “I made that.”

What are the defaults?,"Perhaps they were chosen a very long time ago.
Or with very little thought.
It could be that the constraints that led to the default are long gone.
They might be perpetuating bad choices, injustice or sub-optimal outputs.
The best way to fix something is to look at what we assume is the ‘right’ starting spot.
In persistent systems, it might be difficult to change the default setting, but knowing what it is and how it got there is a great place to begin.

What’s actually useful is to realize that in this moment, under these conditions, this person and people who have this person’s preferences, will often choose a certain path.
When groups of people with a shared preference or attitude choose to do something, we see markets and cultural trends.
But these people aren’t different kinds. They’re simply people responding or reacting to what’s on offer. This means that people can have different responses based on different offers and different conditions.

Jargon comes and goes,"Forty years ago in engineering class, it wasn’t unusual to talk about GIGO or FUBAR. These weren’t technical terms, they were mild complaints that signaled insider status and cultural cohesion.
In a closed profession, like airplane pilots, the insider jargon lasts for generations.

Everyone has access to a recording studio, grammar checker, drawing easel, publishing platform, typesetting tool, stats engine and AI front-end as a result.
A TikTok production team doesn’t have a key grip.

Here’s aclassic episode of Akimbo. Book publishing has changed more in the last ten years than in the previous 500, and we’re living in a moment where the benefits of writing a book are huge and the costs are surprisingly low.

Input choice is easily taken for granted,"We can give instructions to a fellow human by:
Most people develop voiceboxes and limbs and facial expressions that make any of these usable. Computers, over the decades, have had to have them engineered.
In 1983, Dan Lovy built a parser for the adventure games I was marketing at Spinnaker. Suddenly, you could type instructions into the game instead of relying on the more emotional but crude joystick for input. So, “pick up the dragon’s pearl” was something the game could understand.
There’s a restaurant in the Bronx where the waiter asks, “what do you want?” There’s no menu. If you imagine something in a certain range, they’ll make it. This is stressful, because we’re used to the paradigm of multiple choice in this setting.
A smart doctor doesn’t ask, “what’s wrong?” Instead, she takes a few minutes to notice, converse and connect, because our fear of mortality gets in the way of a truthful analysis.
As the worlds of tech and humanity merge, it’s worth thinking hard about the right way to engage with a device.

(And it’s not just a car–sometimes we fail to communicate with each other in a useful and specific way that matches the work to be done…)",,"input, communication, technology"
No thank you,"Failing to acknowledge a favor or a courtesy is a triple mistake, and it’s becoming more common. ChatGPT is now promoting the idea that it can write a thank you note for you, and a text is a lot easier than a handwritten note, and yet, the level of ‘thank you’ seems to be falling.
It’s not that people don’t have the time to offer an honest ‘thank you’. It’s that they don’t want to acknowledge the obligation or connection.
Minimizing a favor is an easy way to stay focused on the noise in our own heads, as opposed to realizing that we’re surrounded by other people.
Hustle culture has discovered that ‘asking for a favor’ often triggers a positive response. This effort on the part of the other person happens because the favor-giver is seeking connection. When the recipient minimizes the favor or fails to say thank you, they create distance, not connection.
The fact that an expression of gratitude requires so little effort makes it even more striking.
To pick a tiny example, if someone lets you into the flow of traffic, a small nod or hand wave costs nothing. But sometimes it feels easier to assert that it was yours to take, as opposed to a kind gesture that you received.
Our failure to take a moment to acknowledge the favor also makes it harder for the next person. If connection isn’t on offer, why not be selfish?
Civility fades in the face of entitlement.
The magic of an honest expression of gratitude is that the person saying thank you might benefit from it as much as the recipient.","October 10, 2023","gratitude, connection, civility"
Possibility and opportunity,"We have the chance to build something that creates connection and generates value. On the other hand, a system that diminishes agency and dignity is inherently unstable.
When we seek to create scarcity and control and optimize output at the expense of our humanity, it may pay off for a while, but it’s brittle and will ultimately fail. As it falters, it’s easy to see how the forces seeking control can double down and simply make the situation even worse.

Password stupidity is no longer viable,"[Of course, it’s not stupidity. It’s fear and superstition, which often go together. First, the rant.]
It’s 2023. Major corporations should not be posting rules like this:
This is not just security theatre. It’s a waste of time, the math makes no sense and it leads people to create worse passwords, not better ones.
If the person who maintains your office sprayed water on the front walk just before the temperature dropped to freezing, you’d never stand for that. If the folks who filed your taxes simply made up numbers that felt like they made sense, you’d switch accountants.
If a company can’t get this simple system right, how can we trust them to make a refrigerator?
There is plenty of insightful, effective thinking about online security. Your organization embarrasses itself when it hassles customers to engage in silliness like this. Stupidity is easier to spot and fix than ever before.
PS if this is broken but looks fine to the boss, what else in your organization is similarly grounded in superstition or the status quo?
[The challenge with tech is that the person doing the work often has a boss who doesn’t understand the work and isn’t willing to put in the time to do so.
Twenty years ago, I ranted about the forms that have a pull-down for US citizens challenging them to choose which of fifty states they live in, and country pull-downs that begin with Andorra and put two of the biggest ecommerce countries in the world at the end of a list of more than a hundred. There’s no good technical reason for this. It’s simply the way someone created a template at the end of the last century, and it’s easier to simply go along.

Getting better at bucket management,"If you throw a bucket of water on a small campfire, you’ll succeed in putting it out.
Pour a bucketful of sake into one of those little glasses and you’ll waste most of it and ruin the table setting.
And try to use a bucket to refill a dried-out lake and not much will happen.
Relativity is everywhere we look. If you put in eight hours on a ten-hour project, you’ll fail. Put that much effort into a smaller, six-hour project and the client will be delighted.
The Grateful Dead remain one of the greatest bands in memory, partly because they relentlessly overfilled what was expected from a band. Those that seek to be the next Grateful Dead inevitably fail, because the standard has been reset.
On the other hand, a tech company that raises a lot of money to ‘change the world’ but merely delivers a really useful tool is seen as a failure.
The promise we make defines the quality that is expected. Market pressure and our own insecurity drive us to make ever bigger promises, but when the promise doesn’t match the deliverable, everyone forgets the effort and workmanship that was delivered.

Nothing to ad,"A recent discussion about the challenges of direct-to-consumer marketing of a skincare product ended with one participant describing the hard part with, “nothing to ad.”
She was referring to how much the thread had covered, but the pun wasn’t lost on us.
Social media offered an irresistible promise to many folks who are looking to do “marketing”:
Of course, this is a really good deal for the social media sites. They do very little and keep almost all the profit.
But competitive pressures make the really good deal into one that it’s hard for a company to live with. Now, instead of $40 to get a click, it costs $50 or $60 or $80. DTC companies end up raising baskets of money and spending just about all of it on social media and online ads, payments to influencers, etc, losing money on every customer.
Once committed, they’re open to trying just about anything. They listen to wise (but actually making-stuff-up) sales reps and consultants about what time to post, whether to use photos, color photos, testimonials, paid influencers, free samples and more. “Oh, you tried to scale your buy too fast, the algorithm can tell…” and all sorts of black box thinking that, from a distance, surely gives away the con of separating a hardworking brand manager from the money they control.
We’ve seen this before, many times, and it almost never ends well. There’s not much to ad.
That’s because the fundamental strategy cannot thrive in a competitive environment. Someone will always be willing to outbid you for attention. Someone will always be willing to lose just a bit more money than you.
The path forward is very different.
Your (current) customers need to bring you your (new) customers.
It’s not ironic but it is edifying to realize that this is EXACTLY how every one of the media companies you’re paying ad money to grew. They grew with word of mouth, not the sorts of ads they’re selling.
Facebook or that influencer–they didn’t grow by running ads and selling subscriptions. They grew when their users felt that it was in their own selfish interests to bring them new users.
As long as your project is built around the misguided myth of “getting the word out” and promoting itself to strangers, you will struggle. Someone always wins the spend-money-on-DTC-promo game, but it probably won’t be you. It’s simply a lottery where one of the spenders hits a magical level of critical mass and becomes buzzy. For the rest of us, there’s only the glorious work of creating a product and a situation that people think is worth talking about. It’s hard, it has dead ends, but it’s the work.
The formulaic attraction of category + money + media consultant = home run is a problem precisely because it’s a formula.
People don’t talk about your product or service because you have a gimmick or hype or because they care about you or even because a thoughtful analysis shows that it has the best features and price performance. They talk about it because they believe it’s good for their status, their affiliation with people they care about or their frame of mind.

Evenly distributed,"For the first time, the only time, everyone on Earth was in the same boat at the same time. We’ve long been divided by privilege, by caste, by accidents of birth or by organized hierarchies.
Sure, there have been events that struck us all at once. Landing on the moon caused us all to gasp simultaneously. But this time was different. Regardless of class or age or nationality, the situation was right there, in front of our face. And it didn’t go away in a few news cycles.
But the responses, of course, were not the same.
Some profiteered and hoarded, cutting the line and seeking a profit, regardless of the cost to others. Some embraced panic while others sought to fan it. Some showed up asking for help while others decided to see who needed help.
And that’s the first lesson of our pandemic. While events might be evenly distributed, responses and reactions rarely are. We are able to choose to see possibility. We are able to lead. We’re able to see beyond a day or a week into the future.
Not simply a few of us.Anyof us.
That choice wasn’t dictated by class or station or race. It was a new decision, made each day, by people who chose to care. Volunteer firemen who showed up for the next alarm. Parents who sat with a kid instead of parking them in front of a device. Doctors who quieted their fears in order to save others.
This leads to the second lesson, which is the choice that is in front of each of us. Just as the pandemic created the opportunity to lead and to contribute, the future is knocking on our doors asking us to make a new decision.
For millennia, we’ve been using our resources to insulate ourselves from the weather. Some are luckier than others in their ability to find a safe haven.
We learned the hard way that our fragile industrial ecosystem isn’t quite as resilient as we hoped. We discovered that we aren’t actually as insulated from nature (and each other) as we might have expected. And we learned (perhaps) that compared to the alternative, preparation is quite cheap.
There will be other flu pandemics, and each time, if history is a guide, we’ll be better at fighting them. But fighting a virus is very different than fighting the weather. The weather, the inexorable rise of the sea, is going to get harder and harder to ignore. The effects are unevenly distributed now, often exposing the most vulnerable, but as we saw with a global pandemic, we won’t be able to buy ourselves peace of mind for long.
The fork in the road is plain to see. Who will lead? Who will see possibility and opportunity and decide to show up now, when we can, to do something about tomorrow? And who will decide to push to go back to business as usual?
Just as air travel and cruise ships spread the virus, our industrial might has planted the seeds of our destruction. At the same time, the modern world has created a system with enough leverage to save itself.
While the system has leverage, the system is not resilient and the system doesn’t lead itself.
The best time to begin is now. Start where you are. Don’t wait for authority or amanual.
Change will come, as it always does, from us.
Each of us. If we care enough to lead.
The opportunity to care is evenly distributed.","October 4, 2023","1. Pandemic

Fooling ourselves,"It’s tempting to believe that we’re not easy to fool.
Not by a magician, a politician or a banker. Other folks might be easily duped by a spammer or a hustler, but not us.
And yet, no one fools you more than you.
When you look in the mirror, do you see what others see, or is it possible you see someone far less (or far more) attractive than others do?
Do we assume that our work is so good and so useful that anyone who doesn’t see that is confused or misguided?
Perhaps we feel like an impostor, a fraud or an unseen genius…
These are all forms of self-deception.
A useful way forward might be to ask, “is it working?”
If the marketplace of ideas, of commerce or of relationships sees something of value, perhaps they’re right. And if they don’t, perhaps we might develop the empathy to understand what’s missing in our narrative about what we do or how we do it.
Marketing to others begins with marketing to ourselves.
If it turns out that our self-deception is a reliable source of fuel for us to achieve our goals, it might be worth living with. But at some point, our ability to fool ourselves becomes toxic. It blocks our ability to create generous and useful work, and it eats away at our confidence and peace of mind.

But it matters a lot to them…,"To get to theKebab House Cafe, you’ll need to drive past a dozen fast food restaurants, restaurants you can find off just about any interstate. It’s certainly less convenient to go a few blocks off the beaten path, but the food and service and vibe might be worth it.
The thing is, it matters even more tothem. The folks that work there, the ones who are building something they’re proud of. It matters to the unique ones, to the ones that are trying harder than the others, to the folks who create interesting and memorable experiences.
And it’s not just one cafe. When a musician, a playwright or an entrepreneur takes a risk, they’re betting someone will care enough to hear them and engage with them. They do the work because they care, not because someone handed them a manual.
The best part is that when it matters to them, it might matter even more to us.
If we want to have the option of choosing something that isn’t in the ordinary course of convenient and cheap, we need to show up for the people who bring it to us.

Learning from the Amazon gift card snafu,"Millions of people got this email last night:
It’s legitimate, but it’s a mistake. A mistake because:
We can learn a lot about what not to do from this.
First, if you make a mistake by email, fix it. Fix it by email AND fix it on your site. Let everyone who got the wrong note know, even if it’s embarrassing.
Second, if your company is built on email, establish a consistent look and feel, an approval process and most of all, definitely, a way to confirm that you actually sent it. For example, if you ever get an email from me, it will also be here on thisblog. If it’s not, it’s a scam.
Now that Amazon has messed up both parts of this process (they got thousands and thousands of complaints last night, overwhelming their hard-working frontline support workers) they’ve opened the door for countless spammers and scammers who lack imagination but are good at following a trail.
While it may seem unrelated, part of the problem is the fear that people have in writing clearly. Here’s a sign I saw at Avis yesterday:
I’m pretty sure that the person who cared enough to make this sign doesn’t actually speak this way. Perhaps if it had said,
“We don’t have a car wash here, but the insides of our cars have been cleaned regularly. If you’d like to get a car wash, we’re delighted to pay you back up to $15 per rental. Thanks for understanding.”

Confusion and certainty,"When facing a complex problem, it’s easy to become confused.
Lately, it’s become socially acceptable to express your confusion with certainty. Untrained in the field, make a pronouncement that makes it clear that you have not just an understanding of what’s going on, but also that you’ve figured out the causes and the next steps.
The thing is, confusion shared often leads to the learning we need to become productive as we move forward. “I don’t understand this part,” is a great thing to say before someone helps you understand it.

The art of estimation,"If you’re a freelancer or a contractor of any kind, it’s typical to be asked for an estimate or a quote.
And if you’ve been doing business for a while, it’s likely that you’ve heard about price more than just about any other factor in losing an opportunity.
So the pressure is on to sharpen your pencil, find the lowest price and do the best work you can under the circumstances.
This leads to a grind and an endless race to the bottom.
The glitch lies in how we interpret the objection about price. What the client is actually saying is, “All things being equal, the other alternative is cheaper, so we went with them.”
But all things don’t have to be equal.
There are plenty of clients who don’t actually want the cheapest choice. They want the best one, and a powerful estimate is the clue they use to choose.
If your estimate:
…then you’ve restated the problem. You’ve brought the client along on the journey with you, and established that they’re not spending more for the same thing, they’re spending more for a better, safer, higher status, more reliable thing.
What’s the best proposal/estimate you’ve ever seen? In your industry or any other? Do you have a standard for this that’s as high as the standard for the craft you do?
Of course, you don’t have the time to do this sort of estimate for every prospect. Which is the second half of the art. Politely declining to do estimates for people who are simply seeking the lowest price. Eagerly and happily send them to the people who used to be your competition.

The network scam,"Lana Swartz coined this term in her breakthroughpaperon crypto.
A scam always involves a transaction. In the traditional fraud, the scammer tells a lie and the buyer, either with or without diligence, believes it and loses everything. You buy the magic beans, but they don’t grow.
But modern scams have a network component to them. Either there are conditions present where the scams are far more likely to occur (because of the magnification media and other forces can offer to the scammer) or, in this case, because the gullible buyer has a hunch it’s a Ponzi scheme, but plays along because he believes he can then pass the buck to the next sucker and come out ahead.
If someone bought an NFT in the belief it was going to go up, without regard for its actual utility, they are participating in a network scam. Without a society of others sharing the same belief, it wouldn’t work.
Perhaps climate denial is also a kind of network scam. If you can pump oil or sell cheap disposable fashion or benefit from subsidized cheap beef, it’s only because other people are joining you in sharing a short-term outlook on the world. Sooner or later (probably sooner), the delusion fades, and people (all of us) are left holding the bag.
In a well-lit and rational world, we could see network scams for what they are, and do something about them before they spiral out of control.
Alas, the alternative is something Swartzquotesa hustler as saying: “If it’s a Ponzi, get in early.”

Nice bike,"A well-designed bicycle is efficient, inexpensive and delightful.
If you use your bike on the right paths, with appropriate goals, it can deliver exactly what you need, while also allowing you to go at your own pace, see what’s going on around you and feel grounded.
Until, of course, you get jealous.
If you start trying to ride your bike on the freeway, or insist on adding extra seats, electric drivetrains and bright lights, sooner or later, you’re going to end up with a vehicle that’s not good at being a bike or a car.
Better, of course, to simply get rid of the bike and get the kind of car you need.

Working with problems,"They’re everywhere we look. Here are a few thoughts on the ones that won’t go away:
First, is it a problem or a situation? Problems, by definition, have solutions. You might not like the cost of the solution, the trade-offs it leads to, or the time and effort it takes, but problems have solutions.
On the other hand, situations don’t. Situations are simply things we need to live with.
Once we realize that a problem we have isn’t a problem at all, but actually a situation, it’s easier to do our best to move on and thrive. Focusing on a situation is usually a source of stress, not a way forward.
Second, has anyone else ever solved a problem like this one in a useful way? If not, it might be a situation. See question one.
Third, if the problem has been around for a while, it might not be aneasyproblem. Those tend to get solved right away. It’s probably a problem that involves more effort or trade-offs than you were hoping for. Resetting our expectations for what it might take to solve gives us the chance to recalibrate it as a situation we’re willing to live with, simply because the cost of the solution is too high.
And finally, some problems get better if we’re willing to talk about them. Some situations, on the other hand, simply get worse when we focus our energy and community on them.","November 18, 2023","problems, situations, solutions"
Who’s got the camera?,"For years, I’ve been using this picture of Neil Armstrong when I tell the story of meeting him and hearing his talk at one of his last public appearances:
I wasn’t there when this photo was taken, so I relied on a Google image search to find it:
I compounded Google’s error. Sorry, Buzz.
Neil had the camera. The photos of him on the moon were taken by a long selfie stick on the LEM. All the iconic shots show a very very tiny image of Neil reflecting in Buzz Aldrin’s visor (so technically, I guess he is in those photos).

The second mistake,"That’s the avoidable one and the one that usually causes the real trouble.
When the first mistake flusters us, breaks our rhythm or messes with our confidence, we’re far more likely to make the second one.

The amateur presenter,"Not “amateur” as in the unprepared professional.
Amateur as in the passionate individual, untrained but with something to say.
If you’re called on to give a talk or presentation, the biggest trap to avoid is the most common: Decide that you need to be just like a professional presenter, but not quite as good. Being a 7 out of 10 at professional presenting is a mistake. Better to stay home and send a memo.
Don’t set yourself up for a ‘fail.’ Instead, here’s a chance to actually share your light and your vision.
No, the opportunity is to refuse to become a slightly prepared wannabe professional presenter. Just like it doesn’t pay to slightly practice the violin or sort of get ready to play in the NHL.
Sure, you might land a few well-timed punchlines or have a clever slide design. And sure, your violin might be in tune or your slap shot might work… But it probably won’t.
The alternative is to eagerly become an amateur presenter. Here are some thoughts to get you started:
Do you have something to say?If you don’t, stay home and send a memo. But if there’s a story you want to tell, a change you want to make, an impact you want to have, be really clear about what it might be. Simply getting through your presentation relatively unscathed probably isn’t a worthy goal.
Don’t apologize.Don’t apologize for being nervous, for caring, for not having 200 practice runs under your belt. The audience is offering you a tiny slice of time and attention. You cared enough to show up, here we go.
Find just one person.This is repeated often enough to be hackneyed, but it’s still ignored. I mean it. You have a microphone. There’s a room with some people in it. One of them, just one, is the sort of person you can tell your story to. So tell it to them. Ignore every other person. Don’t project your voice to fill the room, don’t pace around like Zig Ziglar or choreograph your slides, or tell jokes. You don’t do that in real life. Well, this is real life. Find one person and tell them your story. If other folks want to listen in, that’s fine.
Don’t memorize and don’t read.Very talented actors, recently returned from their strike, can read and make it sound like they’re not reading. A few podcasters I know can do this as well. Almost no one else can. Instead, amateurs understand that they’ve been telling stories their whole lives, and given the chance, they can tell a story again. Without reading it.
This isn’t a performance.Professionals perform. It’s their job. This is you sharing the change you’d like to make with one person sitting a few feet away from you.
Think about the most important interactions you’ve had. The ones with partners, doctors, strangers and friends. None of them were professional speeches. Not one. Instead, a human interacted with you and made a change happen. Not because they had a script and a director, but because they cared.
The challenge isn’t in becoming a sort of pretty good professional presenter. The challenge is becoming you.
Of course, it’s scary. But the response to the fear isn’t to soothe ourselves with memorization and insulation. It’s to simply show up.","November 10, 2023","amateur presenter, storytelling, authenticity"
The paradigm flip,"Paradigm shifts are appealing but rarely well executed.
A paradigm is our mental model of the world. We’re surrounded by people who share a similar model, and as long as the model is working, we live our lives without thinking much about it. If you lived in a space station, the absence of gravity would be something you’d notice at all times… until one day, you didn’t.
Technology and culture conspire to change the rules. When that happens, there are huge opportunities for those bold enough to imagine a different system, a mental model that isn’t simply adjusted, but rebuilt.
Network TV was based on the paradigm of mass markets and the battle for the last few percentage points of share.
Cable TV shifted that (a bit) because niche networks could find plenty of viewers to make a profit, and suddenly, the smallest viable audience was a useful new way to build a media asset. MTV and ESPN couldn’t have worked in a three-channel world, but did fine in one with forty channels.
The real flip, though, comes from YouTube. Now, it’s not about trying hard to add a few channels. It’s about embracing the idea that there’s an infinite number of channels. That a scarcity of spectrum isn’t normal or useful. And no one from the world of network or cable TV understood this or did anything about it. They were focused on shifting, not flipping.
Many of my colleagues and friends in the traditional publishing business are still wrestling with the print version of this. They have assets, reputation and a bit of momentum, but instead of flipping to a new system, they’re inching around a shift.
In medicine, millions of lives have been saved by flipping paradigms. Germ theory, for example, and hand washing. Or more recently, beta-blockers for heart disease, or seeing the role of bacteria in ulcers. In thisvideo, my friendJonathan Sackner Bernsteintalks about his breakthrough work in reconsidering how Parkinson’s actually works:
Not all paradigms flip. Often, humanity is stuck with a culturally-entrenched system that’s difficult to change. But when we see an opportunity to contribute, the hard work is being willing to walk away from our reliance on how things were instead of simply trying to make a small shift happen.","November 9, 2023","paradigm shift, mental model, innovation"
“We used to do that”,"When electricity came along, there was a swath of industries that were trapped in an old way of thinking. The only ones that thrived were able to walk away from what they used to do and eagerly embrace something new.
When the internet was young, the major book publishers had everything they needed to create a dominant search engine. After all, they were in the business of organizing the world’s information. With just one exception, they didn’t even consider it. That’s because they believed that their job was to sell books to bookstores.
This is even more urgent for individuals. What you were trained to do, what you did yesterday… that’s a gift from your past, not an obligation.

Project resistance,"In Steven Pressfield’s classicThe War of Art, he introduces the idea of Resistance. It’s the internal force that keeps us from doing our most important creative work.
If an instinct, a habit or a feeling gets in the way of the work, it’s Pressfield’s Resistance. Things we would never choose to add to the flow of our days, but there they are.
It’s easy to imagine that Resistance is for screenwriters or novelists. Writer’s block and procrastination. But anyone leading a project of any kind–a business, a non-profit, a campaign–confronts it as well.
We could do something, we might do something, but we don’t. And so the work doesn’t ship, or it doesn’t meet its potential.
I’m not alone in facing Resistance. It happens everywhere we look.
Some of the symptoms of Resistance seem contradictory, but if we go back to the definition, that makes sense. Here are a few:
It’s tempting to imagine that Resistance is a moral failing, but it’s more like stubbing your toe or burning the toast. We don’t have to blame ourselves for where we are, but if we can see it and name it, we can learn to dance with it.
These behaviors may seem as though they happentous, but ultimately, they’re a choice. A skill we can learn, a habit we can unlearn. We can be kind to ourselves, focus on the goal and get back to the project.
There are two confusions and one fear:
The first confusion is that we might not realize that these are choices.
The second confusion is that we might not have learned better tactics, tools and choices, but we can.
And the fear? It’s of change. The change of it might not work, or the chance that it will.
When Resistance arises, and it always does, we can see it, name it, and gently move on.","November 7, 2023","Resistance, creativity, project management"

Commonplace technology,"Not all tech is new tech.
The ballpoint pen was a revelation, and a bit controversial. Now, it’s disposable and obvious.
Different industries go through tech spurts. My desk is covered with items I use every day (a mouse, headphones, a solid-state drive, transparent tape, and even a Star Trek communicator) that were risky breakthroughs, and now they are simply commonplace (though we now call the communicator a phone).
When tech is coming at us too quickly, it’s tempting to simply wait. It’s risky to be an early adopter.
But once the pace slows down a bit, once our peers and competitors are benefitting from a productivity breakthrough, our aversion should be more intentional than that. Perhaps it’s time to reconsider the tech we once said we were too busy to bother learning.

On choosing a college,"For some fortunate 17 year olds, the end of the year is the day for a momentous decision, one that’s largely out of the comfort zone of a 17 year old.
A four-year college education in the US can cost nearly half a million dollars once we count the expenses and foregone opportunities that go with it. It can shift our persona, our learning and most of all, the systems we live in for the rest of our lives…
One way to make a complex decision of this magnitude is to relentlessly make it simpler. We can begin by vividly describing the flavors, factors and preferences that go into the choice (I have heard every single one of these from students I’ve coached or spent time with) and then pruning them away:
Many of these are matters of short-term taste, and are the sorts of things we bring up when everything else either feels the same or we’re afraid to examine the real issues too closely. In my case, I picked the college I went to partly based on the radio station I heard (or didn’t hear) when I visited the campus.
Here’s a different way to look at it, one that we can broaden into an insight about adult decisions about where to work, where to live, who to hang out with. There are two parts:
That’s it.
It doesn’t matter if the campus is pretty or if the football team is good. It doesn’t matter if it was sunny on the day you visited. Unless… unless those factors are the factors that are attracting and keeping the folks you had in mind in #1.
A party school isn’t a party school because there’s a good liquor store on campus. It’s a party school because the combination of #1 and #2 create a self-perpetuating system.
Once you answer these two questions, pick the least expensive option that helps you get to where you’re going.
Perhaps this feels like a big decision because it’s about you. But it’s not actually about the you you are right now. It’s about the you you hope to become.","December 31, 2023","college decision, financial impact, personal growth"
Benign vs. normal,"We evolved to be wary of change. Our attention is limited, new things can be a threat and the status quo feels comfortable.
As a result, we spend a lot of time and energy being afraid (and arguing about) the upcoming changes in our lives, but almost no time at all thinking about the things we’re used to.
A decade from now, people will look back on things we do now and view them as dangerous, foolish or selfish. If they were introduced today, they’d be shunned, not embraced. If someone had just invented the coal mine, it would be a really hard sell.
The takeaway isn’t that any particular habit or technology is inherently dangerous. It’s that giving the benefit of the doubt to the established ones might be a mistake.","December 30, 2023","Change, complacency, innovation"

It’s hard to tell a fad from a trend when you’re in the middle of it.
But often, that’s our job.

When a professional is showing you how to do something, take a video of it, label it and put it in the cloud for later.
Take pictures of all of your credit cards, IDs and important documents.
When you’re having a good day, go for a walk and record a ten minute audio sharing your optimism, confidence and possibility. You’ll want to listen to it again.
When a recurring event happens for the first time, put it in your calendar. The dog meds reminder will happen without you prompting it every month.

Signal and noise,"If the signal is very weak and the noise is large, it’s easy to imagine that there’s no signal at all.
AI and computers can be used as lenses now, which means we can strip away the noise and see things that we certainly didn’t expect.
Dina Katabiat MIT can point a radio antenna at you while you’re sleeping (even from across the room or through drywall) and determine whether you’re dreaming or not.
We can see patterns in how people type, surf the web or interact with others. We can sort through huge volumes of data and find connections that others were sure were invisible. Not just in whether we’re dreaming, but in how medicine works, the forces driving our culture and more.
Systems work because each element of the system sends a signal to the other elements. Sometimes those signals are obvious and the system works in predictable ways. Other times, we rely on false proxies because we simply can’t tell the signals from the noise. Newdiagnosticsin every field are changing this.
Typical consumer AI is a clever trick that makes us think the computer is a pretty good writer. But machine learning aimed at patterns and signals shows us things that we never knew were there.
For a long time, we’ve assumed that complex systems (like the brain, or the weather) were a sort of magic. As we are able to decode the signals, though, we have a chance to understand how they work.","December 15, 2023","Signal, AI, Patterns"
Eight marketing maxims,"December 14, 2023","December 14, 2023","marketing, maxims, principles"
Valuable contributions,"We actually don’t really know.
Netflix just released their first-ever detailed analysis of how many hours of engagement the top 15,000+ most watched shows on the network received over a six month period. Here’s thefile.
Who won?
That question is actually the lesson here. The fact is, most organizations are pretty clueless about where real value lies. We’re all playingMoneyball, all the time.
The obvious answer: more hours watched = more value created is pretty easily dismissed. In fact, a lonely couch potato with no friends who watches for eighty hours a week is probably costing Netflix more than they’re paying.
A show that’s popular but easily replaced by another show that could find the good luck to be popular is a shiny trap.
Perhaps value is created by the creator of a show that is the one show that gets someone to keep paying their Netflix bill, even if they only watch an hour a week.
Perhaps it’s a show that a group finds worth talking about, so each hour of viewing translates into new customers for the network.
Maybe it’s a show that earns them a reputation as creator-friendly, so it brings them the next generation of story tellers.
Or it might be the show that costs not very much to license from abroad, but generates plenty of impact for a difficult to reach portion of the audience…
At the local car rental place, the most valuable employee might be the one who made sure, at the last moment, that the car didn’t smell like cigarettes, or found a defect that might have led to a breakdown. It’s easy to show that saving a good customer is worth far more than pushing for a fancy ad that only attracts some bargain-seeking short-term customers.
Whether you’re running a political campaign, a non-profit fundraiser or a network, it’s almost certain that your team is confused about where the value really lies.","December 13, 2023","Value, Engagement, Media"
Digital stocking stuffers (and the other kind),"Ever since O. Henry wrote about theMagi, it’s been pretty clear that gifts aren’t about the stuff as much as they are the intent. Holidays where gifts are expected undermine this, because it’s hard to tell where obligation begins and intent fades away.
One lightweight and quick alternative to traditional items are digital ones. Here are a bunch offree ebooksfor you to share, or consider giving someone asubscriptionto this blog. There are also countless free ebook and audiobooks out there, as well as thousands of hours of Grateful Dead concerts. Consider spending an hour to teach someone you care about a new skill, or how to understand or streamline their digital day (includingRSS, a gift that keeps on giving).
If you’re looking for physical items, I just discovered the best water bottle ever made. I contacted the company and volunteered to contribute a collab to support their mission. And of course,you can get onewith my logo on it. It also comes with a ridiculous poem I asked chatGPT to write.

"Walking the city, walking the world","Last week, I passed 800 people as I walked my way through New York.
I decided to look at the folks I was walking near.
Of those 800 people, not one was as conventionally attractive as a movie star. Few looked like the images I saw on the billboards I passed. Most wouldn’t be cast in a commercial. Perhaps 40 went to a famous college, maybe 10 played competitive sports. All of them were kinder and wiser than the typical TV character, and cared very much about something important.
They were older and younger than the average ‘target market’ for most products. Some carried canes, wore glasses, or had hearing aids. A few were in wheelchairs. A bunch could run far faster than I can, and every one of them knew about things I’ve never even thought about.
If we zoom out and imagine passing 800 randomly chosen people from around the world, we see even more of what it means to be on this planet. Of those 800, fewer than 300 have ever been on an airplane. Half are smarter than average. 200 speak a little English. 50 make just a few dollars a day. Four or five live in bondage. Very few of them have as big an impact on the climate as you and I, and more than 600 of them are very concerned about what’s happening to the world around us.
For a long time, scaled consumer marketing has created status roles where none used to exist, and amplified division and class as a way to create insufficiency and generate sales.
But what we see when we look at the media or at a stack of resumes doesn’t accurately represent the world as it is.

"Wrestling, fighting or dancing?","We can wrestle with a challenge or a problem and find energy and possibility while doing it.
And we can dance with someone else as we seek a mutual way forward.
Fighting tends to be more brutal, final and hurtful than is often productive. You don’t want to spend your days fighting.
The words matter.","December 9, 2023","Wrestling, dancing, fighting"
All species are invasive species,"Human beings as we know them have only been around for 70,000 years or so.
Honeybees got to North America around the time Columbus did.
And the same is true for technologies and companies. Western Union was an interloper, telegrams were the scary new tech that was going to change everything for the worse.
It’s easy to be in favor of the status quo, but it’s also true that the status quo used to be a brand-new threat.","December 8, 2023","invasive species, status quo, technologies"
Abundance and ideas,"A colleague got an angry note. It concluded with, “you should know better.”
The transgression? The sender was offended that my friend had written a post about a concept she’s been developing for nearly a decade. Of course, no idea is unique, and the posted idea sort of rhymed with one that the professor had been working on for a while as well.
The note demanded she take down the post.
Really?
In general, when you think someone is poaching your idea, it’s worth remembering that they probably aren’t, that you probably weren’t first, that the ideas probably don’t overlap as much as you think, and… even if itisprecisely what you thought of in the first place, the spreading of an idea is a good thing.
I’ve managed to coin dozens of fairly original phrases over the years, and some are based on new concepts I brought forward. I only have time to do this because I don’t spend my days bothering people who write posts that I imagine overlap with my work. There are books by others based on these ideas, and even entire industries. I’m not waiting for royalty checks or even credit lines any time soon.
In fact, when people write posts that overlap, that’s a good thing.
Ideas that spread, win.
No, don’t take credit for an idea that’s not yours. You look smarter and more confident when you give credit where credit is due. Giving credit is generative and raises your status.
But there’s no reason to need to persistently expand thetakingof credit. It brings a scarcity mindset to the work, when what we need to do is generate connection and possibility instead.
If everyone in town comes to your factory and takes a sample, you’re in trouble. But if everyone takes your idea (or an idea that you think is sort of like your idea), you’re onto something.","December 7, 2023","Abundance, Ideas, Collaboration"
Hope and expectations,"They’re not the same thing.
Hope can fuel us. Hope can be refilled. Hope opens the door to possibility.
Expectations, on the other hand, are a trap. They make us brittle and lead to disappointment.
When we raise our hopes and lower our expectations, we establish a resilient way forward.","December 6, 2023","hope, expectations, resilience"
The head of marketing,"It’s easy to be confused about this job, because it’s not one job, it’s at least three.
This is why it’s a difficult job to fill, and why turnover is so high–we’re not allocating resources or setting expectations in a way that matches the work to be done.
Marketing strategy:This is the work of positioning, story telling, status and affiliation. It’s understanding network effects, the user experience and the change we seek to make. Good marketing strategy overcomes just about everything else. Some of mybooksare about this.
Promotion: This is more tactical. It’s coupons and PR and perhaps advertising. It’s steady permission marketing, a thoughtful content strategy and a team of people who consistently and generously tell your story. This is what many people think of as marketing, but while it needs to be consistent with the strategy, it’s a different set of skills and activities.
Sales support:In many organizations, the main role of marketing is to support the work of the sales team. This integrated role feels very different from the typical brand marketer’s job.
Project management: Given how much time, money and effort go into the marketing function, it requires consistent and insightful leadership. There are a lot of constituents, moving parts and decisions to be made.
Prettiness: Definitely not worth putting in bold. This is logo design, empty phrases about look and feel and endless debates about taste.
When the CEO says she’s looking for marketing help, it’s probable that what seems to be missing is promotion. But without the other two elements, not much is going to happen.","December 5, 2023","marketing strategy, promotion, sales support"
Wild Hope Now: The power of books for causes,"Non-profits and charities depend on the emotional and financial support of their backers. And that support is always based on a story. A story of possibility, of justice, of community. They serve to right wrongs, to fix problems, to shine a light and to make things better.
I’ve discovered that a book is a powerful tool for sharing this story.
This week, Afya is launching a book by my friend Danielle Butin.It’s only available on their site.
Wild Hope Nowis the story of one person who saw a problem and refused to turn away. And it’s the story of how she began in her backyard, organizing one person, then ten, then entire institutions. Afya is now saving lives around the world.
Books likeWild Hope Nowand the ones I’ve listed below humanize the magic of these causes. While a video can go viral, a book can make it easy to not only share the story with others, but actually make an impact.

The ideas in these books and books like these really resonate with me. I find myself hearing the authors’ voices as I go about my day, a reminder that better is not only urgent, but it’s possible. Possible here and possible now.
Sharing books like these is a triple gift. You learn something. The person you buy a copy for feels seen and respected and learns something as well. And the growth in support for the cause makes a difference for the long haul.","December 4, 2023","Books, Non-profits, Impact"
The sixty-day staircase,"In the moment, it’s really difficult.
l’esprit de l’escalier means, “the spirit of the staircase.” That thing you wished you had a said just a moment ago, the bon mot or the clever riposte. It only comes to us as we’re walking away.
But this sort of quick comment is good for the movies, not so much for the work we seek to do.
When we’re in the middle of it, when the speed bump or emergency arises, perhaps it pays to write a blog post about the incident that will go live in two months. Or to simply think about what you will remember about this moment then.
Two months ago, that thing that happened, could you handle it better now?
We’re able to build the habit of finding that staircase.",,"staircase, reflection, growth"
True/useful,"Here’s a simple grid that might change the way you think about internal stories:
When we believe in something that’s useful but not true, it can serve a helpful purpose. The tooth fairy, perhaps.
When we act on something that’s useful and also true, we’ve found a resilient path forward. That’s because the truth doesn’t vary based on whether or not others choose to acknowledge it.
In the top left is the cynical corner of focusing on things that while true, aren’t particularly useful. Thinking about the fact that a critic hated your last film isn’t going to help you with your next film, especially if the work wasn’t designed to please the critic in the first place.
And in the bottom left is the common trap of believing things that aren’t true, and that aren’t helpful either. These beliefs lead to ennui, to frustration and to division.","December 3, 2023","Internal stories, truth vs. usefulness, beliefs"
When was the last time you used a compass?,"How about an astrolabe?
Or even a watch?
Technology advances, and sooner or later, the old stuff gets left behind. It’s easy to romanticize some of the classic devices that we built civilization on, and it’s worth remembering that the tech we’re wrestling with now will soon be faded away, with some folks nostalgic for the good old days.

When the committee decides,"They’re almost always conservative. Whether it’s a governmental body, the strategy group at a big company or the membership panel at the local country club, we can learn a lot by seeing what they approve and when they stall.
Of course, each of us know a lot about our offering, the change we seek to make and why it’s better. It’s easy to believe that, “If I were you I’d pick this obvious, rational choice…” and pitch accordingly.
But they’re not you. They’re the committee. And the committee almost never makes what outsiders might say is the ‘right’ decision, instead they choose what’s right for them, now.
And that is usually a combination of:
Persistence. A new idea is almost never embraced right away. It might take years. It’s easier to wait to see who will be there tomorrow than to grab what’s here today.
Urgency. Advance planning is clearly the smart move, but with fear, risk avoidance, and competing priorities, it’s the urgent that is often put on the agenda.
Affiliation. “What will our peers say?” is an unspoken but powerful force. Everyone else, or the appearance of everyone else has a huge impact.
WIFM. Not a radio station, but the truth that each person choosing begins with concern about what’s in it for them. It might be status, affiliation, avoidance of fear or a simple desire (or a complex one).
Compromise. It’s a committee, after all. Group acceptance of a small benefit might be seen as better than a bigger benefit that’s divisive.
Status. There are the status roles within the committee (who suggested this, who will benefit the most from this) and the status roles the committee sees within the organization and across organizations. Moving up (or not falling behind) is at the forefront of many decisions.
A better idea has little chance in the face of these forces.","December 1, 2023","Committee decision-making, Influence factors, Organizational dynamics"
The best possible use,"I walked by a psychic’s storefront studio. The window said that this person had been reading palms and predicting the future since 1989. It was a large space on a vibrant New York City corner. The rent must be astronomical. Or else the purveyor owns the building.
Given that this retail space is quite coveted and the storefront is almost always empty, is this the best use for the space? Wouldn’t the psychic owner do better by renting it to someone who values it more highly?
The metaphor for our use of time is clear.
The next few minutes or days or months–sure, you own them, and you can put them to whatever use you choose. But just because you’ve been using your time in a particular way for a long time doesn’t mean you need to keep doing that.","January 31, 2024","psychic, time management, opportunity cost"
Redundancy has a half-life,"At first, this stop sign sign makes a lot of sense:
Lives are at stake. Break the rhythm, turn something ignored into something noticed.
The challenge with “highlighting”is that it fades. When everything is in all caps, nothing is. Exclamation points are like salt.
When people are commanded to pay attention, it’s worth reminding ourselves that we’re asking for payment. That attention is scarce. And that we waste it, all the time.
When we prioritize our pattern breaks, rotate them and keep them fresh, we’re more likely to get the useful attention we need.Also…
