Gravity is just a theory,"Are you marketing gravity or evolution?
Newton gets all kinds of credit. They call it theLaw of Gravity.They put his picture on pages that profile geniuses. They say he discovered gravity. Nonsense. He just named it.
Everyone ‘believes’ in gravity. And yet, we know virtually nothing about it. We don’t know how gravity waves (if there are any) are transmitted. We can’t block them (anti gravity boots!) and we can’t amplify them and we have no idea how fast they travel. There are very few people doing serious gravity research and development, either. But it’s apparently a law.
Evolution (and one’s confidence or lack of belief thereof), on the other hand, is enough to sway a school board election or get you nominated for federal office. I’ve never met an informed person who doubted the general facts about evolution unless they had an alternative view of the origin of species that they felt emotionally connected to. There are evolution skeptics who would prefer a differentstory,but no gravity skeptics, even though there’s a lot less science there.
What’s up with that?
There are two reasons that gravity has had so much better marketing than evolution, and both may impact the way you market your product or service as well.
1. If the story of your marketing requires the prospect to abandon a previously believed story, you have a lot of work to do.
Nobody had a seriously described theory of gravity before Newton named it. No one walks around saying that they have a story about why we stick to the earth better than the gravity story. As a result, there was no existing story or worldview to overthrow.Naming something that people already believe in is very smart marketing.
2. If the timeframe of the message of your marketing is longer than the attention span (or lifetime) of the person you are marketing to, you have your work cut out for you as well.
Evolution is really slow. Hard to demonstrate it in real time during a school board meeting. Gravity is instantaneous. Baseball players use it every day.
Five years ago, if you wanted to persuade people to buy real estate as an investment it was pretty easy.
1. The existing worldview was that real estate was a pretty good investment.2. You could see, in the course of weeks or months, the price of homes going up.
Magic. Who’s in? Bid, bid, bid.
In 2002, persuading a newspaper to go all in and invest big in online media was a problem.
1. The existing worldview disagreed with this. The web could support a paper, but not replace it. ""Didn’t you see what happened during the bubble?""2. Not only couldn’t you watch the web replace existing media in real time, but it was actually retreating (according to Wall Street.)
Tough story, bad timing.
The iPhone is gravity marketing. New name and brand for something so many people had already decided they wanted. And you could see it work from across the room, you didn’t have to wait months for the joy to happen.
Persuading someone to start a blog is evolution marketing. Lots of people have been brainwashed that they have nothing to say, or can’t say it, or aren’t allowed to say it. And you rarely see someone become an overnight blogging success.
Real estate, of course, has a long row to hoe now. While there may be a long-term story to sell, it’s in conflict to a painfully learned new worldview, and it’s happening slowly. Perhaps there’s a better story to tell.
The Atkins Diet countered the prevailing story (it said that steak and butter were good diet choices) but it burned off weight so quickly the diet was able to overcome the resistance that was due to inertia. Getting people to quit smoking, on the other hand, is a multi-generational problem because the story (spread by ads and movies) is really powerful and the results of quitting take decades to measure.
Acupuncture is an interesting case. It’s possible to market acupuncture as, ""Western medicine is wrong, this works."" The problem, of course, is that any time you market a product with, ""You were wrong,"" you have a lot of work to do. It can also be marketed as ""This is a great way to supplement your ordinary medical treatments.""
Tactic 1: Try to tell a story that complements an existing story rather than calling it out as false.
Tactic 2: Try to make the ‘proof’ as vivid and immediate as possible. Like an apple falling on your head.
Big ideas often demand a marketing strategy that is a lot more difficult than marketing gravity. Sometimes results do take a long time. Sometimes the consumer has been wrong all along. Sometimes you do need to replace an existing story. I hope you will. But this takes time and patience and resources.
When in doubt, market gravity.",,"gravity, marketing, evolution"
If you could change your life,"…would you?
Getting into Stanford Business School changed my life. In college, I trained to be a mediocre engineer (I didn’t set out to be mediocre at it, but I sure was). I was on track to become Dilbert.
Getting into Stanford meant jumping the track. Going from one path to another in one fell swoop.
I didn’t learn much of substance at business school, but that’s fine, because the school allowed me to make a graceful transition. I had permission to reinvent and a platform to do it.
Which leads to this post, this track andthis opportunity. (Please read all the details at this link before jumping up and down).
I’m offering an apprenticeship/not-internship/graduate school/charm school track-changing opportunity to a few people this winter. It’s free, it’s fairly audacious and I hope you’ll check it out. It might not be for you (in fact, it probably isn’t) but I have no doubt that you know people who might be interested.
I’m convinced that there are people out there who–given the right teaching, encouragement and opportunity–can change the world. I’m hoping you can prove me right. You don’t have much time and there are only a few slots, so if you’re even flirting with this idea,check out the lens here.
Two years at business school is a lot of time (and money) to spend to change paths these days. Most people over 20 can’t afford either. I think six months might be a lot more do-able.
The beautiful conceit of Stanford during its heyday was that they recruited people who were really quite good at something, even though it might not be business. Or people who were at one level in an organization but strived to jump ahead several notches. I had a pro golfer and a teacher in my section, for example. As far as I can tell, most MBA programs have become finishing schools for commercial bankers hoping to become consultants and investment bankers (at least until recent events occurred). Thecreative achieversneed a new, faster way to jump the track. For a few, this might be it.
This is a huge commitment for the people who sign up, of course, and a big shift for me as well. So, I’m leaving myself this escape hatch: if I can’t find enough truly amazing people to take advantage of the opportunity, I’ll quietly move on and won’t do it (this time). I’m not prepared to settle, and you shouldn’t either. But, if I’m right about the caliber of restless people reading this, I’m figuring that there will be plenty of amazing people out there passionate enough to take a leap.
So, if you think you’d like to find a new track, here’s your chance. If you think you might be able to turbocharge your impact on the world, let me know. Sort of my way of repaying the admissions officer at Stanford who was crazy enough to let me in all those years ago.","December 1, 2008","Track-changing, Apprenticeship, Reinvention"
What is school for?,"Seems like a simple question, but given how much time and money we spend on it, it has a wide range of answers, many unexplored, some contradictory. I have a few thoughts about education, how we use it to market ourselves and compete, and I realized that without a common place to start, it's hard to figure out what to do.
So, a starter list. The purpose of school is to:
If you have the email address of the school board or principals, perhaps you'll forward this list to them (and I hope youarein communication with them regardless, since it's a big chunk of your future and your taxes!). Should make an interesting starting point for a discussion.","January 31, 2009","education, purpose, school"
What are you good at?,"As you consider marketing yourself for your next gig, consider the difference between process and content.
Content is domain knowledge. People you know or skills you've developed. Playing the piano or writing copy about furniture sales. A rolodex of movers in a given industry, or your ability to compute stress ratios in your head.
Domain knowledge is important, but it's (often) easily learnable.
Process, on the other hand, refers to the emotional intelligence skills you have about managing projects, visualizing success, persuading other people of your point of view, dealing with multiple priorities, etc. This stuff is insanely valuable and hard to learn. Unfortunately, it's usually overlooked by headhunters and HR folks, partly because it's hard to accredit or check off in a database.
Venture capitalists like hiring second or third time entrepreneurs because they understand process, not because they can do a spreadsheet.
As the world changes ever faster, as industries shrink and others grow, process ability is priceless. Figure out which sort of process you're world-class at and get even better at it. Then, learn the domain… that's what the internet is for.
One of the reasons that super-talented people become entrepreneurs is that they can put their process expertise to work in a world that often undervalues it.","January 30, 2009","Process, Emotional Intelligence, Domain Knowledge"
What would a professional do?,"Every day, you do a hundred or a thousand jobs, some of which are occasionally handled by specialists. You make a sales call or give a presentation or answer the phone… you design a slide or create a simple spreadsheet. You get the idea.
When you are busy being a jack of all trades, you're competing against professionals. The recipient of your work doesn't care that you are also capable of doing other things. All she wants is the best she can get.
I'll define a professional as a specialist who does industry standard work for hire. A professional presenter, for example, could give a presentation on anything, not just the topic on which you're passionate about.
When you compete with professionals, you have a problem, because generally speaking, they're better at what they do than you are.
I think there are four valid ways the think your way out of this situation:
The first option requires time and money you might not have, and I'm presuming that's why you didn't do it in the first place.
The second is a smart option, particularly if you do the work often and the quality matters. Slide design and selling are two examples that come to mind here. The first step to getting good is admitting that you aren't (yet.) Invest the time and become a pro if it's important.
The third option is worth investigation, but it's what you've probably already decided without putting words to it. Is the assumption really true? Does your customer/client/employeeactually believethat they haven't been shortchanged by your amateur performance? It is costing you in ways you're not measuring because you're willfully ignoring the consequences? Think of all the sub-pro experiences you've had as a customer, instances where someone was pretending to be a chef or a bartender or a computer jock but just came up short… Were you delighted?
The fourth option is really exciting. FrompersonalYouTubevideos to particularly poignant andhonest presentationsor direct and truesalespitches, the humility, freshness and transparency that comes with an honest performance might actually be better than what a professional could do. Harvey Milk was an amateur politician, not a pro. If you're the only person on earth who could have done what you just did, then you're a proud amateur.
You can't skate by when you refuse to mimic a professional. You must connect in a personal, lasting way that matters. That's difficult, but the professionals have no chance to compete with you.
Be an amateur on purpose, not because you have to.","January 29, 2009","professionalism, competition, authenticity"
Take the ball and go home,"Bullies can't be bullies when they are alone.
If you work with a bully, this is all you need to know. They need you.
A bully is someone who uses physical or psychological force to demean and demoralize someone else. A bully isn't challenging your ideas, or working with you to find a better outcome. A bully is playing a game, one that he or she enjoys and needs. You're welcome to play this game if it makes you happy, but for most people, it will make you miserable. So don't.
The way to work with a bully is not to try to please her or to question the quality of your work or to appease her or to hide from her.
The way to work with a bully is to take the ball and go home. First time, every time.
When there's no ball, there's no game. Bullies hate that. So they'll either behave so they can play with you or they'll go bully someone else.
Call her on her behavior (not who she is, but what she does). ""I'm sorry, but when you talk to me like that, I'm unable to do good work. I'll be in my office if you need me."" Then walk out, not in a huff, but with a measure of respect for the person (not the behavior).
This is a shocking piece of advice. It might even get you fired. But it will probably save your job and your sanity. Most bullies are deeply unhappy and you might just save their skin. If you're good at what you do, you deserve better than a bully.","January 28, 2009","bullying, workplace, boundaries"
Creativity and stretching the sweatshirt,"What does it mean to be creative?
You could watch the most non-creative, linear-thinking, do-it-by-the-book cop work to solve a crime and you'd be amazed at how creative her solutions seem to be. Creative for you, because you've never been in that territory before, it's all new, it's all at the edges. Boring for her, because it's the same thing she does every time. It's not creative at all.
For me, creativity is the stuff you do at the edges.But the edges are different for everyone, and the edges change over time. If you visualize the territory you work in as an old Boston Bruins sweatshirt, realize that over time, it stretches out, it gets looser, the edges move away. Stuff that would have been creative last year isn't creative at all today, because it's not near the edges any more.
This gives you two useful tactics for problem solving:1. If you want to be creative, understand that you'll need to get to the edges, even if the edges have moved. Being creative means immediately going to the place the last person left off.
2. If you are ""not creative,"" if you are the sort of person that gets uncomfortable being creative or has been persuaded you're not capable, don't worry about it. Just stretch the sweatshirt in your spare time, watch the creative things other people have done, keep up with the state of the art. Then, when you do your ""not creative"" thing, most people will think it's pretty creative indeed.","January 27, 2009","Creativity, Problem Solving, Personal Growth"
The goals you never hear about,"Doing goal setting with friends and colleagues is always motivating and invigorating for me. You hear things ranging from, ""I want to help this village get out of poverty,"" or ""I want to double our market share,"" or ""I want to be financially independent.""
What you rarely hear is, ""I don't want to fail,"" ""I don't want to look stupid,"" or ""I don't want to make any mistakes.""
The problem is that those goals are really common, and left unsaid, they dominate. If your goal is not to be called on in class, that's a largely achievable goal, right?
Think about how often your goal at a conference or a meeting or in a project is, ""don't screw up!"" or ""don't make a fool of yourself and say the wrong thing."" These are very easy goals to achieve, of course. Just do as little as possible. The problem is that they sabotage your real goals, the achievement ones.
It's not stupid to have a stated goal of starting several ventures that will fail, or asking three stupid questions a week, or posting a blog post that the world disagrees with. If you don't have goals like this, how exactly are you going to luck into being remarkable?","January 26, 2009","Goal-setting, Fear of failure, Achievement"

Anatomy of a campaign,"The box just said ""Scharffen Berger"" on the return label.
I opened it up and there was a simple hand-written note. It said, ""Seth, have you ever tasted a chocolate bar like this before? Regards, Raymond Major."" His business card was stapled to the note. His title? Senior Staff Scientist.
Attached: exactly one three-ouncechocolate bar, in grey cardboard. The bar itself was wrapped in a waxed-paper like substance, hand folded with a label.
And the chocolate (Tome-Acu 68%) was mind-blowingly good.
Handmade, anticipated and wonderful. From a division of Hershey!
So, what exactly happened here?
So, you ask, what if I (the marketer) don't know the blogger or the reporter? What if I don't have permission? What if they don't care about me? What if my product is mediocre?
Alas, the answer isn't good. The answer is: tough. Is this an unreasonable expectation? Lengths too great to have to go to? Well, it's cheaper than buying an ad on the Super Bowl or even buying shelf space at the Safeway.
The way to win is to make things that tiny (or large!) groups want to talk about, or care about, or engage in. That's the story that spreads.
PS as I finished writing this, I got a letter in the mail at home from the local Mexican restaurant. They probably purchased the address of every single person in town from a mailing list broker. It's cheap. Add a stamp and a return address that's interesting (why are they writing to me) and I'll open it.
It was a letter apologizing to the town for how lousy the restaurant had been since it opened three months ago and how hard they were working to fix it and how much they appreciated everyone's feedback. It had a real name at the bottom, a phone number and a $10 gift certificate attached. Wow.",,"Marketing, Chocolate, Customer Engagement"
Good guys finish…,"I got a note yesterday that said, ""I'll be curious to know if it's possible to succeed and to stay clean as I see a lot of dirty ""crooks"" out there. I am trying to work with good ethics, but I see a lot of successful people talking/teaching ""black Hats"" strategies that scare me.""
Spiritual businessis an interesting concept. Is what you do all day at work part of who you are? Is it possible to be a deceitful crook all week but a good person on the weekend?
Can you succeed financially by acting in an ethical way?
I think the Net has opened both ends of the curve. On one hand, black hat tactics, scams, deceit and misdirection are far easier than ever to imagine and to scale. There are certainly people quietly banking millions of dollars as they lie and cheat their way to traffic and clicks.
On the other hand, there's far bigger growth associated with transparency. When your Facebook profile shows years of real connections and outreach and help for your friends, it's a lot more likely you'll get that great job.
When your customer service policies delight rather than enrage, word of mouth more than pays your costs. When past investors blog about how successful and ethical you were, it's a lot easier to attract new investors.
The Net enlarges the public sphere and shrinks the private one. And black hats require the private sphere to exist and thrive. More light = more success for the ethical players.
In a competitive world, then, one withincreasinglight, the way to win is not to shave more corners or hide more behavior, because you're going against the grain, fighting the tide of increasing light. In fact, the opposite is true. Individuals and organizations that can compete on generosity and fairness repeatedly defeat those that only do it grudgingly.","January 24, 2009","Ethics, Success, Transparency"

That’s a special case,"The reason it’s so difficult for people in traditional industries to embrace new models online is that the transition isn’t structured in an orderly way.
The new business isn’t the same as the old business, just with computers.

What marketers sell is hope.
The reason is simple: people need more. We run out. We need it replenished. Hope is almost always in short supply.
The magical thing about selling hope is that it makes everything else work better, every day get better, every project work better, every relationship feel better. If you can actually deliver on the hope you sell, there will be a line out the door.

Rubbernecking,"I hate rubberneckers. Or at least I despise the human nature that creates that behavior.

Leaving aside the time tax they place on the people behind them (once I was in a three hour jam due to rubber necking of a death on the other side of the road, across the median), what are these people doing? People who wouldn’t dream of paying money to watch a snuff film are indulging their curiosity to see carnage on the side of the road and paying with their time and attention.
You know the punchline: the Net is suddenly filled with rubberneckers. People who spend their time at work watching flame wars or indulging their desire to act like trolls, just to get a response. They race to post about plane crashes or server crashes, and they have no trouble investing an hour in debating something that just makes them feel sick.

Love (and annoying),"The goal is to create a product that people love. If people love it, they’ll forgive a lot. They’ll talk about it. They’ll promote it. They’ll come back. They’ll be less price sensitive. They’ll bring their friends. They’ll work with you to make it better.
If you can’t do that, though, perhaps you can make your service or product less annoying.
I understand that ""love"" and ""annoying"" are rarely two ends of the spectrum, but in this case, I think they are.
I think smart marketers at Apple work to make products that people love. Smart marketers at American Airlines ought to work at making an airline that isn’t annoying.
Firefox used to be a product that people loved. Compared to the alternatives, it was magical. You could go on a quest to promote it and improve it.
At that point, a few years ago, the Firefox movement had a choice. Either continue to make it ever more quirky and lovable (engaging a small audience, but with more passion), or work to make it less annoying (and allow it reach more people). Today, peoplelike(not love) Firefox, they continue to use it, the idea spreads, but slowly. The goal has been chosen by the Firefox folks: to continue to make it less annoying. That’s disappointing to the passionate, but it’s a strategy.
Another example: I use iCal to keep track of my schedule. It defaults new appointments to 9 am, and if the appointment isn’t at 9 am, I have to manually change it. Makes sense. Problem: If the appointment is at 4 pm, and I change the 9 to a 4, iCal sets the alarm to go off at 4am.Hey, wait a minute. I have never, ever had an appointment at 4 am. Doesn’t iCal know this? Why is it so annoying! No one is ever going to love iCal as it stands, or even with some simple improvements, so why don’t the engineers spend time making it less annoying instead?
What could iCal do to make the product something you would love? Really love? Clearly, that would require an overhaul. What could they do to make it less annoying? 100 little things, easy to do.
Example: Momofuku was a New York restaurant beloved by many people. People loved it because (not in spite of) how annoying they could be. They were annoyingly inflexible. They didn’t have particularly comfortable seating, or great waiters. And the flagship restaurant makes getting a reservation almost impossible. The quirkiness was part of the deal. Something to talk about when you brought a friend…
If all they did was think of ways to be less annoying, the restaurant wouldn’t get better for the people who loved it, it would get worse. Unfortunately, they got really popular, forgot what made them lovable and crossed a line. The annoying parts got really annoying, and they forgot to dream up new ways to be beloved. I gave up. It flipped and I hate it now. It’s unlovedandannoying. Boy are customers like me fickle.
Think of the pretty ordinary things you do or places you go. Could they be less annoying? What if the marketers there spent time and money to eliminate annoying? No, it’s not the sort of big time stuff that leads to love, but they’re probably not going to get to love anyway. I’m not going to love my dry cleaner or the post office. But if they made them less annoying, I’d spend more money and go more often. Face it, you use Fedex because it’s less annoying than the post office, not because you love them.
I think there’s a chasm here. You don’t go for love and end up with less annoying. You need to do one or the other. There are products and services I love that are annoying, but that’s okay, because that’s part of being in love. And there are products and services that are annoyance-free, but I don’t love them. That’s okay too. I like them just fine.
Put a sign on your office door, or send a memo to the team. It should say either, ""Everything we do needs to make our product less annoying"" or ""Everything we do should be idiosyncratic and engage people and invite them to fall in love with us. That’s not easy, which is why it’s worth it."" Can’t have both. Must do one.","January 18, 2009","Love, annoying, product strategy"

1. If people criticize you, they are actually criticizing your behavior, not you.2. If you’re not happy with the perception you generate, change the words you type and the messages you send.3.

Book and theater and restaurant reviews? In fact, there are more of these online, often better, definitely more personal and relevant, and also in no danger of going away.
The full page ads for local department stores? The free standing inserts on Sunday? The supermarket coupons? Easily replaced.
How about the editorials and op eds? Again, I think we’re not going to see opinion go away, in fact, the web amplifies the good stuff.
What’s left is local news, investigative journalism and intelligent coverage of national news. Perhaps 2% of the cost of a typical paper. I worry about the quality of a democracy when the the state government or the local government can do what it wants without intelligent coverage. I worry about the abuse of power when the only thing a corrupt official needs to worry about is the TV news. I worry about the quality of legislation when there isn’t a passionate, unbiased reporter there to explain it to us.
But then I see the in depth stories about the gowns to be worn to the inauguration or the selection of the White House dog and I wonder if newspapers are the most efficient way to do this anyway.
The web has excelled at breaking the world into the tiniest independent parts. We don’t usethisto supportthatonline. Things support themselves. The food blog isn’t a loss leader for the gardening blog. They’re separate, usually run by separate people or organizations.
Punchline: if we really care about the investigation and the analysis, we’ll pay for it one way or another. Maybe it’s a public good, a non profit function. Maybe a philanthropist puts up money for prizes. Maybe the Woodward and Bernstein of 2017 make so much money from breaking a story that it leads to a whole new generation of journalists.
The reality is that this sort of journalism is relatively cheap (compared to everything else the newspaper had to do in order to bring it to us.) Newspapers took two cents of journalism and wrapped in ninety-eight cents of overhead and distraction. The magic of the web, the reason you should care about this even if you don’t care about the news, is that when the marginal cost of something is free and when the time to deliver it is zero, the economics become magical. It’s like 6 divided by zero. Infinity.

Traffic magnets,"Here’s a trick that’s as old as the web: Run a popularity contest with public voting. It could be anything from a listing of the top blogs to a creative contest for best tagline or ad.
The nominees run around like crazy, hoping to get their friends to vote. Which of course brings you more traffic. This is a large part of the strategy behind Threadless.
I get invited to vote in these all the time, to participate as a nominee regularly and most vexing, to post them here as a way of helping this person or that person achieve some sort of nirvana.
My feeling is that most of the time the cause is too thin and the prize is too lame. If your blog gets picked as the most popular woodworking blog by some other blog, it’s really unlikely that you’ll find many benefits other than a nice smile for your ego. On the other hand, if you can offer a great prize and/or be useful and relevant, this is a permanent tool in the web toolbox for you.
As I’ve said, I don’t promote these. But, just this one time, I’m breaking my rule for Becky, who didn’t even ask me to mention this, and for my friend Dan Pink, who has written another terrific book. If you’d be so kind to visitDan’s siteand vote for ""stay hungry,"" it’s quite likely that Becky will win a paid for trip to TED UK, which she deserves and will benefit from.(She’s only a hundred votes out of first place as I write this).

Beauty as a signaling strategy,"What’s beauty? You know it when you see it, sure, but what is it? It turns out that beauty is an important evolutionary byproduct.
An organism needs to invest energy in being beautiful. You won’t see healthy skin on a sick animal, because maintaining a healthy coat is too ‘expensive’. A sick peacock isn’t as spectacular as a healthy one. Or a genetically damaged chimp isn’t going to have as symmetrical a face. As a result, most creatures evolved their definitions of beauty in a mate to match the displays of healthy creatures.
Human beings have adopted this signaling strategy with a vengeance. I know a woman who is going to spend more than $9,000 having her hair styled in 2009 (hey, that’s less than $200 a week). Entire industries are based on human beings spending time and money in order to manufacture temporary physical beauty.
Businesses build lobbies that they rarely use, giant atriums with big windows and lots of empty space. It’s a waste, it’s expensive and it’s beautiful. It’s beautifulbecauseit’s expensive.
Stop for a minute and think about the relationship between expense and beauty.
Do you make something beautiful? It could be the way you write hand written letters or leave a little extra on the product, even if maybe it’s not so efficient. Sometimes efficiency is beautiful, but only when it took a lot of extra effort to get there. Ordinary products are almost never beautiful. Austere products might be, but only when real effort is expended to make them that way.
Even the most hard-hearted people are suckers for beauty. We treat people and products differently when we think they’re beautiful. The reason people and organizations have invested so much in beauty over the years is that beauty pays off.
A website that doesn’t cram ads into every single nook and cranny is more beautiful… it’s also more expensive to run in the short run. A salesperson who doesn’t squeeze you for every penny is more confident, earning more of your trust–that’s beautiful.
When everyone has it, it ceases to be beautiful. (Babies are beautiful because time takes their babyhood away so quickly… it’s a guaranteed temporary effect). Beauty is a signal, not just a physical state.",,"Beauty, Signaling Strategy, Evolutionary"
In the mood,"Songsabout romance don’t tell you how to make out, they merely encourage it. It’s not the data that people seek, it’s the mood.
If all we needed to do great work was information, our problems would be over. The internet is the greatest repository anyone could imagine… if you want to knowhowto do something, the Net will show you how.Anything.
The how, of course, is not important. Books and songs and movies that have an impact work because they motivate us to take action, not because they show us exactly what to do.
Did you not have enough information or expertise to start a successful business during the last boom? Or the boom before that? Are you so ill-informed that you are unable to make a profitable sales call, unable to answer the phone, unable to persuade someone to join your cause? That’s unlikely.
We don’t have a knowledge shortage.Far from it.
I get very annoyed at pundits who criticize a book for not having enough proof, not enough data, not enough rigorous case studies. I am disappointed at people who hesitate to start something important because they’re just waiting to learn enough or know enough or to figure out the answer.
It’s like the annoying kid at the magic show shouting, ""I know how you did that trick!"" Of course you do.
The question isn’t, ""how do you do the trick?"" The question is, ""do you feel like doing the work, taking the risk, making a stand and getting it done?"" If you don’t know how to do the trick, go look it up. Get a tutor. Figure it out. That’s the easy part.
You already know how to deliver excellent service that blows people away. You just don’t feel like it. Your organization has the resources to buy that machine or enter that market or change that policy. They’re just not in the mood.

Time to start a newspaper,"What should not-so-busy real estate brokers do?
Why not start a local newspaper?
Here’s how I would do it. Assume you’ve got six people in your office. Each person is responsible to do two things each day:
Twice a week, send out the ‘newspaper’ by email. After one week, it will have more than 500 subscribers and contain more than 20 interesting short articles or quotes about people in the neighborhood. Within a month, (if it’s any good) every single person in town who matters will be reading it and forwarding it along to others.
It will cost you nothing. It will become your gift to the community. And it will be a long lasting asset that belongs to you, not to the competition. (And yes, you can do this if you’re a plumber or a chiropractor. And yes, you can do this if ‘local’ isn’t geographic for you, but vertical).

What to do when the new thing doesn’t work,"Every once in a while I hear from frustrated bloggers and other new media denizens. They’re frustrated that their work isn’t spreading fast enough, that the new tools aren’t working the way they want them to.
The kneejerk rejection is always the same: Spam! Promote! Advertise! Enough with this zen nonsense, I want to be in charge. Who can I hire? How can I spend? Who do you know? The new tools didn’t work, I need the old tools.
Winning an online popularity contest, being mentioned on boingboing, doing a direct mail campaign… these things are tempting, but they are the panicked half-measures of someone who is going to lose.
From the start, you have to choose a path and stick with it. Either you are on the path of the TV Industrial complex, and you’re prepared to promote and spam and spend and make average stuff for average people… or you are busy embracing the new media for everything it can offer.
Don’t get stuck in the middle. It’s painful.

The thing about goals,"Having goals is a pain in the neck.
If you don’t have a goal (a corporate goal, a market share goal, a personal career goal, an athletic goal…) then you can just do your best. You can take what comes. You can reprioritize on a regular basis. If you don’t have a goal, you never have to worry about missing it. If you don’t have a goal you don’t need nearly as many excuses, either.
Not having a goal lets you make a ruckus, or have more fun, or spend time doing what mattersright now,which is, after all, the moment in which you are living.
The thing about goals is that living without them is a lot more fun, in the short run.
It seems to me, though, that the people who get things done, who lead, who grow and who make an impact… those people have goals.","January 8, 2009","goals, impact, flexibility"
Boundaries,"I think you can tell a lot about a person or an organization by looking at how they deal with boundaries.
Rigid boundaries:What do you do when you hit a wall? Do you have a tantrum? Spend countless resources trying to scale the unscalable? Or do you accept reality and put your energy into something else?
No boundaries:When there’s nothing but open space, do you run? Or shrink?
Consider the American car companies. When faced with real boundaries (like the diminishing supply of oil and the high price of gasoline) they ignored them. When faced with no boundaries (like the opportunity for rapid technological advancement) they hid.
Or consider that misbehaved kid in school. He has a fit when he doesn’t get what he wants, and then spends days scheming to get it. Or that student who excels in college, takes extra courses, starts organizations and runs as fast as he can.
Microsoft has had boundary problems. The challenges of the US antitrust suit were a boundary, one that led to a huge timesink and distraction for the company. And the internet is a no-boundary zone, one that seems to intimidate them.
Sure, sometimes a boundary isn’t really a boundary. Telling them apart is a key pat of the process. But once you realize that there is (or isn’t) a boundary there, what now?","January 7, 2009","Boundaries, Adaptation, Organizational behavior"
Willing to be lucky,"I just heard Kurt Andersenquote E.B. White with this glorious phrase.

My closest friends each were found as a result ofchance encounters and luck. So were my biggest ideas and some of mymost successful ventures.It’s very easy to plot a course for today that minimizes the chance of disappointment or bad outcomes or lousy luck.

Teaching people a lesson,"David writes in to point out that banks are losing a fortune on foreclosures because many frustrated homeowners are trashing the houses before they leave. This dramatically diminishes the value of the home and leaves scars all around.
Why not, he wonders, offer the homeowners $1000 in cash if they leave the house in great condition?
I can hear the objections already. ""What! Why should we pay people not to break the law!"" After all, if you do it this time, if you bribe people to behave, then you’ll have to do it every time…
Every time? How often, exactly, do you expect to evict a person?
It’s very easy to set up policies and procedures designed to give people what they deserve, to set a standard, to teach a lesson, to make sure they understand who’s boss. And I think that for parents, this is an excellent idea. Bribing your kid leads to spoiled kids who don’t get it. But businesses aren’t parents and customers aren’t kids.
""I can’t let you in, because you didn’t follow the procedure, and even though you’re never coming back here again, if I let you in now, without having followed the procedure, you’ll think that you can ignore the procedure the next time you do business with someone else…"" It sounds stupid when you say it that way because it is stupid.
You can extend this all the way to how you hire people. Is penalizing a 40 year old by not giving her a job a way to teach her a lesson about studying harder for the SAT when she was 17?

Do ads work?,"If the local bank were offering a sale on dollar bills, ninety cents each, how many would you buy?
Most rational people would say, ""I’ll take them all please."" Especially if you had thirty days to pay for them.
So, why, precisely, do you have an ad budget?
If your ads work, if you can measure them and they return more profit than they cost, why not keep buying them until they stop working?
And if they don’t work, why are you running them?
The time-tested response is that you’re not sure, that ads are risky, that you can’t tell. And for some sorts of products and some sorts of ads, you’ll get no argument from me.
Digital ads are different (or they should be). You should know cost per click and revenue per click and be able to make a smart guess about lifetime value of a click. And if that’s positive, buy, buy, buy.
And if you don’t know those things, why are you buying digital ads?
When Amazon was at its key growth peak, the mantra there was $33. They would buy unlimited ads, of any kind, as long as they generated new customers for $33 or less each. There was a risk that $33 was too high a number for the business to sustain, but the ads were no risk at all. As long as they came in under that number, there was unlimited money to buy them.

Change your pricing,"When a restaurant goes from a la carte to either a buffet or a prix fixe meal, it is able to find a new class of customers.
Could a law firm charge by the project? When I incorporated Yoyodyne, a fancy firm charged us a fix rate.
Netflix went from charging by the rental to charging by the month.
We use tolls to charge people who drive over bridges more than other folks. We don’t hesitate to charge people ordering steak more than people ordering pasta in a restaurant. Could the library charge frequent readers more? What about insurance companies charging more to young families (more likely to have a baby).
Ski areas have a huge fixed cost base (land, grooming, etc.) so they get greedy, sell too many lift tickets and the lines get long. Fixed pricing encourages people to ski a lot, at peak times. What if only cost $3 to get on the mountain, plus a small charge for each lift ride and a premium price for popular lifts at popular times? The technology is already there, the only reason not to try it is momentum.
If you’re a copywriter or masseuse or other sort of freelancer, how many retainer clients do you need to relax and spend more time on the work, less on the billing/looking part? What happens when an artist does this?
Why don’t airlines experiment with auctioning of seats, baseball card style? You could buy the rights to a seat for $200 (speculating, if you like) and then try to sell it off as the flight time get closer–it’s not hard to imagine an easy to use website for these transactions. The seat might change hands a dozen times, earning the airline a processing fee each time, and enriching those that want to start trading this expiring commodity.

Personal branding in the age of Google,"A friend advertised on Craigslist for a housekeeper.
Three interesting resumes came to the top. She googled each person's name.
The first search turned up a MySpace page. There was a picture of the applicant, drinking beer from a funnel. Under hobbies, the first entry was, ""binge drinking.""
The second search turned up a personal blog (a good one, actually). The most recent entry said something like, ""I am applying for some menial jobs that are below me, and I'm annoyed by it. I'll certainly quit the minute I sell a few paintings.""
And the third? There were only six matches, and the sixth was from the local police department, indicating that the applicant had been arrested for shoplifting two years earlier.
Three for three.

Of course, you don't have to be a drunk, a thief or a bitter failure for this to backfire. Everything you do now ends up in your permanent record.

Curious, I engaged with him. I took out a dollar bill and took the four quarters.
Then he turned to me and said, ""can you spare a quarter?""
What a fascinating interaction.
First, he engaged me. A fair trade, one that perhaps even benefited me, not him.
Now, we have a relationship. Now, he knows I have a quarter (in my hand, even). So his next request is much more difficult to turn down. If he had just walked up to me and said, ""can you spare a quarter,"" he would have been invisible.

Reinventing the Kindle (part II),"Okay, so Amazon's Kindle is cool and it's gaining in traction and people who have one buy a lot of books. 10% of Amazon's book sales are now on the Kindle. [For books where both versions are available].
But it could be so much better. Here are mynewest riffsfor Jeff and Co.:
1. Give publishers (throughout this post, when I say publishers, I also mean self-published authors) the ability to insert passalong credit with a book. So, if you buy a book, it might come with the right to forward it, for free, to two other people who also have Kindles. Three clicks and you just spread the book.
Let me log in with Facebook Connect and send certain books to all my friends who also have a Kindle.
Let me see the list of the fastest-spreading books. Or fastest spreading among my friends.
2. Give publishers the ability to send free samples of new books to people who have opted in. For example, I could have a master setting on my Kindle that said, ""for any book I finish, give the publisher permission to send me up to six free samples."" This creates a lever for successful authors and an asset for successful publishers. It lets them start publishing books for their readers instead of trying to find readers for their books.
What happens when Malcolm Gladwell sends a note to all his readers recommending a new book?
3. Anytime I send someone a book (see #1) or recommend a book, let me (with the other person's consent) see the comments they write in the margins of the book as they read it. Imagine being able to read a novel this way with your book group, or a sales manual with your department.
4. Create dynamic pricing. As a book gets more popular, allow the publisher to give a rebate to the first # of  readers… either all or part of a book. If I get good at reading hit books first, I'll end up paying close to nothing but be rewarded for my good taste and ability to sneeze ideas.
5. Let anyone become a publisher with just a few clicks.
6. Demolish the textbook market as soon as possible by publishingopen source textbooksfor free. It's only natural that profit-minded professors will work to replace this by using #5.
7. Give publishers the ability to insert quizzes or feedback. This creates a certification or continuing ed or textbook opportunity far bigger than a book can deliver.
8. Allow all-you-can-eat subscriptions if the author or publisher wants to provide it. Let me buy every book Seth has written, or all the business books I can handle, or ""up to ten books a week."" Remember, the marginal cost of a book is now the cost of the bandwidth to deliver it, so buffets make economic sense.
9. And my last one, which I think I mentioned earlier, but it's so good, I'll mention it again: ship the Kindle with $1000 worth of books on it. I'm willing to contribute a couple of titles, and my guess is that most authors would.
It's pretty simple: many book publishers look at this new medium and ask, ""how can I use it to augment my current business model."" I'd like Amazon to challenge that thinking and say to the world, ""how can you use this platform to create a new business model?""

Is marketing evil?,"Marketing works.
If you spend time and money (with skill) you can tell a story that spreads, that influences people, that changes actions. Marketing can cause people to buy something that they wouldn't have bought without marketing, vote for someone they might not have considered and support an organization that would have been invisible otherwise.
If marketing doesn't work, then a lot of us are wasting a great deal of effort (and cash). But it does.
So, does that make marketing evil? In a story about this blog,Timemagazine wrote, tongue in cheek, ""Entry you'll never see [on his blog]:Is marketing evil? Based on a long career in the business, I'd have to answer 'yes.'""
Actually, I need to amend what this pundit said. I'll add this entry:Are marketers evil? Based on a long career in the business, I'd have to answer ""some of them.""
I think it's evil to persuade kids to start smoking, to cynically manipulate the electoral or political process, to lie to people in ways that cause disastrous side effects. I think it's evil to sell a patent medicine when an effective one is available. I think it's evil to come up with new ways to make obesity acceptable so you can make a few more bucks.
Marketing is beautiful when it persuades people to get a polio vaccine or wash their hands before doing surgery. Marketing is powerful when it sells a product to someone who discovers more joy or more productivity because he bought it. Marketing is magic when it elects someone who changes the community for the better. Ever since Josiah Wedgwood invented marketing a few centuries ago, it has been used to increase productivity and wealth.
I've got a lot of nerve telling you that what you do might be immoral. It's immoral to rob someone's house and burn it to the ground, but is it immoral to market them into foreclosure? Well, if marketing works, if it's worth the time and money, then I don't think it matters a bit if you're doing your job. It's still wrong.
Just like every powerful tool, the impact comes from the craftsman, not the tool.Marketing has more reach, with more speed, than it has ever had before. With less money, you can have more impact than anyone could have imagined just ten years ago. The question, one I hope you'll ask yourself, is what are you going to do with that impact?
For me, marketing works for society when the marketer and consumer are both aware of what's happening and are both satisfied with the ultimate outcome. I don't think it's evil to make someone happy by selling them cosmetics, because beauty isn't the goal, it's the process that brings joy. On the other hand, swindling someone out of their house in order to make a sales commission…
Just because you can market something doesn't mean you should.You've got the power, so you're responsible, regardless of what your boss tells you to do.
The good news is that I'm not in charge of what's evil and what's not. You, your customers and their neighbors are.

Raising ostriches, or timing the market or investing in tulips–there's a long history here. The schemes tend to have a few things in common. They tend to have the same tone of voice (part breathless, part bad design, part 'we're just like you') and most of all, they are too good to be true.
Being too good to be true is the key part, because if it's too good to be true, maybe, just maybe, itistrue. Maybe all those stuck in the mud types aren't doing it because they're skeptics, maybe I get a chance to invest in this video program/perpetual motion machine/envelope stuffing scheme precisely because it has scared away the conservative folks who never get anywhere.
Online, of course, like most things online, this has blossomed. You'll see the long long web pages filled with ALL CAPS and bright colors and testimonials and ""wait there's more!"" They look alike for a reason–it's a signal to the opportunity seeker that this is one of those.
Do they convert watchers into buyers? Sure they do. Do a few people make money? Of course.
There's a tribe here, and it's always looking for a new leader. Someone who will sell them an exclusive $1249 course, or ongoing advice and consulting or some other insight that has escaped the market leaders. The more skeptics they generate, the better they do, because the skepticism itself is part of the story that needs to be told.
What's being sold here? It's not riches, because if the riches were automatic, the seller would just hire people, right? Why make 1,000 people into millionaires if you can just hire 1,000 people and be a billionaire? No, it's the belief in riches, the thrill of finding just the right deal, the challenge of getting a relative to loan you money one more time. It's the frisson of excitement from sending in the money, the rush of impatience that follows as you wait for the package, and then the scary moment when you open the package and come face to face with your dreams.
Of course, your dreams are rarely what you hoped (how could they be?) but soon, you'll be back for more. It seems that being an opportunity seeker is about seeking, not finding.","February 22, 2009","get rich quick, opportunity seekers, schemes"

What an extraordinarily universal way to construct a product, a service or a business. Notice that dreams are rarely ""within reason"" or ""under the circumstances."" No, dreams are dreams. If your business is a dream come true for customers, you win. Game over.
Too often, I hear about businesses that just might be a dream come true for their owners, but hardly for the people they seek to recruit or the customers they hope to snare. What do your prospects dream of? What would get them to wait in line?","February 21, 2009","dreams, business, customers"

"Sorry, you can’t be our customer","There are interactions marketers have with prospects where the prospect wants something and the marketer or organization just isn't interested in delivering it. These interactions almost always end badly.
I visited a Blockbuster store in London, hoping to rent an appropriately Royal-family focused DVD. After a bit of search, I found it. Would they sell it to me? No, it's rental only. Oh, can I rent it? (I asked with my full US accent). Sure, fill out this form.
Five minutes later, they said, ""Oh, you're from the US. You can't rent here."" What about if I pay as much money as it would cost if the DVD got lost? Nope. What if my hotel vouches for me? No.
Here's the thing: From the rational consumer's point of view, this is silly. They should take my money and we'll both be happy. From Blockbuster management's point of view, though, allowing clerks to start making up exceptions and prices is just too much trouble. And it probably is.
You can't (and shouldn't) please every single person who may or may not become a customer. But you should (and you must) figure out what to tell the folks you're going to turn away. Endless negotiations are like teaching a cat to swim… the cat never learns and you get frustrated.
""I'm sorry, I appreciate your interest, but you can't be our customer. We can't please everyone and we're focused on customers with different needs just now. Can I suggest you try the place down the street? I'll draw you a map.""
The power of this outcome is that you have the freedom to figure out exactly what someone has to do in order to be a customer. You can qualify people by asking the right questions. You can take no for an answer.
If it turns out that you're getting too many 'no' responses, too many people walking out empty handed, it's probably time to reconsider what you need from someone in order for them to do business with you.",,"customer qualification, rejection handling, marketing interactions"
The rational marketer (and the irrational customer),"The most common frustration I see, and I see it daily, comes from marketers who can't figure out why more people won't buy their product. This particularly afflicts b2b marketers, who ostensibly have rational customers.
Let's say, for example, that you have a service that can deliver leads for five percent of what it costs to get them via a trade show. Why would any rational business, particularly one that says it wants qualified leads, spend that money on trade shows and not on you?
I mean, I mean, you can PROVE that your system works. You can guarantee it. You can provide testimonials and real-time evidence. And yet, the person you're calling on won't give you money and will spend it on the traditional system, which is a total waste.
Youknowthat your car is more aerodynamic. Youknowthat your insulation is more effective. Youknowthat your insurance has a higher ROI.
You've thought about it a lot because it's your job to think about it. It's your job to make those charts and tables and graphs and brochures. So you know it.
The problem is that your prospect doesn't care about any of those things. He cares about his boss or the story you're telling or the risk or the hassle of making a change. He cares about who you know and what other people will think when he tells them what he's done after he buys from you.
The opportunity, then, is not to insist that your customers get more rational, but instead to embrace just how irrational they are. Give them what they need. Help them satisfy their needs at the same time they get the measurable, rational results your product can give them in the long run.","February 17, 2009","Rationality, Marketing, Customer Behavior"
Authenticity,"If it acts like a duck (all the time), it's a duck. Doesn't matter if the duck thinks it's a dog, it's still a duck as far as the rest of us are concerned.
Authenticity, for me, is doing what you promise, not ""being who you are"".
That's because 'being' is too amorphous and we are notoriously bad atjudging that. Internal vision is always blurry. Doing, on the other hand, is an act that can be seen byall.
As the Internet and a connected culture places a higher premium on authenticity (because if you're inconsistent, you're going to get caught) it's easy to confuse authentic behavior with an existential crisis. Are you really good enough, kind enough, generous enough and brave enough to be authentically a hero or leader?
Mother Theresa was filled withself doubt. But she was an authentic saint, because she always acted like one.
You could spend your time wondering if what you say you are is really you. Or you could just act like that all the time. That's good enough, thanks. Save the angst for later.","February 16, 2009","Authenticity, Action, Consistency"

Music vs. the music industry,"Some excerpts from aninterviewon the future of the music industry. I was being specific about one industry, but I think it applies to just about everything:
The music industry is really focused on the‘industry’ part and not so much on the ‘music’ part. This is thegreatest moment in the history of music if your dream is to distributeas much music as possible to as many people as possible, or if yourgoal is to make it as easy as possible to become heard as a musician.There’s never been a time like this before. So if your focus is onmusic, it’s great. If your focus is on the industry part and the limos,the advances, the lawyers, polycarbonate and vinyl, it’s horrible. Theshift that is happening right now is that the people who insist onkeeping the world as it was are going to get more and more frustrateduntil they lose their jobs. People who want to invent a whole new setof rules, a new paradigm, can’t believe their good fortune and howlucky they are that the people in the industry aren’t noticing anopportunity…
I define a tribe as a group of people sharing a common culture, agoal, a mission, probably a leader. There are tribes of people – likethe ones who go to South by Southwest – who are connected because theywant to remake the music industry. There is the tribe of people whofollow Bruce Springsteen and will pay unreasonable amounts of money tohear him live and compare playlists. The important distinction here isthat music labels used to be in the business of grabbing shelf space,on the radio and in the record store. Now, the music industry needs torealign and be in the business of finding and connecting and leadinggroups of people who want to follow a musician and connect with theother people who want to do the same…
In the ‘70s or ‘80s you listened to a song because “everyone else” wasalso listening to it. That’s the definition of pop music. In those dayswe defined “everyone else” as people in our high school or people wholistened to WPLJ. Now, “everyoneelse” is not defined by where you live or what radio station you listento. It’s defined by which horizontal or vertical slice of the world youconnect yourself with. I might listen toKeller Williamsbecause everyone else in my world includes frustrated Deadheads. Wedon’t have new Grateful Dead to listen to, so everyone else in mycircle is listening to Keller Williams, so he is pop to us. He’s notpop to the kids at the middle school who have never heard of him,right? So you end up with all these silos and niches and lots and lotsof ways to look at the world…
Digital is about to surpass the CD, and onceit starts to happen it’s going to happen faster and faster and faster.The more interesting thing to me is who is going to control theplaylist. If there is an infinite amount of music available – and Iwould argue that as soon as the amount of music available exceeds theamount of time you have in your life, that’s infinite – somebody willhave the leverageable spot of deciding what to listen to next. And it’sunclear whether someone will charge to tell me that or will pay to tellme that. It’s still up for grabs in every one of these vertical silos.Who are the tastemakers and how do these ideas spread? The analogy Ilike to give is if you’re an author and Oprah Winfrey calls, you don’tsay, “How much are you going to pay me to go on your show and give awayall the ideas in my book?” In fact, if you could you would pay to be onOprah. For a really long time the music industry has had two minds: Onthe one hand, they would pay money to be on Clear Channel or MTV; onthe other hand, they would charge you money to hear their music inconcert or out of your stereo. Those days are all getting interminglednow. “I am the program director of my radio station, so where’s mypayola?”
R&G:When a band brands itself, there is a credibility issue with their fan base; they run the risk of being perceived as a sellout.
Seth:I think the first thing I’d ask is, “perceived as a sellout by whom?” Some people sayPatricia Barberis a sellout because she’s a popular jazz musician as opposed to astarving jazz musician. But the people in the crowd don’t think that. Ithink selling out is largely about expectation, about being transparentand telling the truth to your audience. When Talking Heads wentfrom being unsuccessful at CBGB to being really successful on MTV andmaking a movie with Jonathan Demme, some people said they sold out.Other people said they wished they were more pop-like. I’m not surethat’s something that needs to be at the beginning of the conversation.I think that what you have to do is make it clear to your tribe and toyourself what you stand for, and do that.","February 13, 2009","Music industry, digital distribution, tastemakers"
Calling your bluff,"Billionaire raconteur Mark Cuban justposteda fascinating challenge. Post a business plan that meets certain criteria and he'll consider funding it, right here, right now.
Here's what's neat:1. As soon as you see enough plans, you realize that in fact there are tons of ways to create a viable business in just a few months. There's no shortage of ideas worth stealing.
2. Mark asks that you describe how much money you need and how much equity you'll give up for it. My guess is that for most of these businesses, that causes the entrepreneur to whittle down the money that's actually necessary (hey, that money is expensive!) until the point that they don't need Mark's money at all. They can just start.
The comments on his thread are typical of what happens when you call someone's bluff. There are plenty of skeptics, critics, trolls and naysayers. What a shame. Shun the non-believers.

The power of an algorithm,"An algorithm is a set of instructions that allows you to solve a problem.
Each instruction is simple and repeatable. It's important to understand that the instructions work on all similar problems, not just one.
Here's an algorithm for sorting any set of numbers, to get them into order. Start with 4,3,5,6,2 for example.
Thebubble sortalgorithm is simple. Compare two numbers. If the first number is higher than the second, switch them. So now it's 3,4,5,6,2. Next step is to compare positions two and three. If the second is higher than the third (it's not) switch them. Repeat for the whole string. Then start over. Do it over and over again until you can go the whole way with no switching. Done.
Same trick works for alphabetizing words or sorting kids in order by height.
Of course, there are algorithms that are far more complex, far more intuitive or far more useful.
Algorithms don't care a bit if you believe in them or not. They either work or they don't.
Algorithms in business appear to be magical, because they allow you to be smart about problems you haven't seen before. The 'angry customer' algorithm or the 'promote a book' algorithm don't always work, but they are approaches that work on a huge range of problems.
All of which is a long way to wish Charles Darwin a happy birthday. The simple algorithm he described is often misunderstood but is robust and flexible and powerful, and it works for ideas and businesses as well as fruit flies and turtles.
Ideas that spread, win. Sometimes ideas get changed in transmission, and sometimes those changed ideas spread even farther and with more impact than the ideas that came before them.
In business, if you lock down ideas, make them difficult to change and spread and have impact, you fail. If you accept the fact that change is real, that there is competition for your ideas and that amplifying the good stuff works, you can grow and thrive.
Seeing the algorithm in action (which the Net makes easy) helps you understand the notion of failing fast, of exposing ideas to the real world with a posture of perpetual beta. The clothing store Zara doesn't have clothes for a particular season, they launch clothes for a particular fortnight. They watch and measure and adjust and then repeat.
Your organization (and your career) eitherembraceschange and turmoil and sudden shifts in the rules or youfearit. In times of rapid change (that would be now), embracing the algorithm of the evolution of ideas and systems is a significant competitive advantage.",,"algorithm, change, ideas"

Which parts are you skipping?,"The top of a mountain is rarely the best part.
You can watch ""the good parts"" of a baseball game in about six minutes. The web has become a giant highlights reel… the best parts ofSNL, the best parts of a speech, the best parts of a book.
We can skim really fast now. This is a problem for marketers, because it means that if they don't make the good parts easily findable and accessible (and bold and loud and memorable) then the whole product becomes invisible.
As consumers of information, though, I wonder if the best parts are really the best parts. Yes, you can read a summary of a book instead of a book, or watch the trailer instead of the movie, or read the executive summary of the consultant's report instead of the whole thing… but the parts you miss are there for a reason.
Real change is rarely caused by the good parts. Real change and impact and joy come from the foundation and the transitions and the little messages that sneak in when you least expect them. The highlights of the baseball game are highlights largely because the rest of the game got you ready for them.

Sprint!,"The best way to overcome your fear of creativity, brainstorming, intelligent risk taking or navigating a tricky situation might be to sprint.
When we sprint, all the internal dialogue falls away and we just go as fast as we possibly can. When you're sprinting you don't feel that sore knee and you don't worry that the ground isn't perfectly level. You just run.
You can't sprint forever. That's what makes it sprinting. The brevity of the event is a key part of why it works.
""Quick, you have thirty minutes to come up with ten business ideas.""
""Hurry, we need to write a new script for our commercial… we have fifteen minutes.""
My first huge project was launching a major brand of science-fiction computer adventure games (Ray Bradbury, Michael Crichton, etc.). I stopped going to business school classes in order to do the launch.
One day, right after a red eye flight, the president of the company told me that the company had canceled the project. They didn't have enough resources to launch all the products we had, our progress was too slow and the packaging wasn't ready yet.
I went to my office spent the next 20 hours rewriting every word of text, redesigning every package, rebuilding every schedule and inventing a new promotional strategy. It was probably 6 weeks of work for a motivated committee, and I did it in one swoop. Like lifting a car off an infant, it was impossible, and I have no recollection at all of the project now.
The board reconsidered and the project was back on again. I didn't get scared untilafterthe sprint. You can't sprint every day but it's probably a good idea to sprint regularly.","February 9, 2009","Creativity, Sprinting, Brainstorming"
Learning all the time,"My post onpossible uses of educationstruck a chord with people. Different people are looking for different outcomes.
The first implication of this list: why did you stop educating yourself when you graduated?
Not you, of course. You read blogs and by that action demonstrate that you're looking for something new, or useful, or important.
I'm fascinated by the way the marketplace treats non-fiction books, particularly business books. The most popular business book of all time was purchased by less than 3% of all the people who could benefit from it, and read by a tiny fraction of that group. I'm guessing that less than 10% of the people who read this blog have read one of my books.
Books remind us of school, of chores, of homework. Give someone a DVD of a hit movie currently in the theaters and they'll eagerly thank you and watch it that weekend. Give them a book and it's a whole commotion. ""I read that book!"" they brag to you next week, when maybe they didn't really.
Which leads toThe 100 Best Business Books of All Time, which is a shortcut in the best sense of the word. Not some sort of prurient blog list designed to draw traffic, the book actually makes you sound smart because the authors tell you what each book says… so you can get back to your DVD.
The #1 habit successful people share with me is this: They read books to learn. They do it often and with joy. It's cheap (or free, at the library or online) and portable and specific. Jack and Todd's book might be a good place to start the habit.","February 8, 2009","Education, Reading, Business Books"
The customer is always wrong,"Richard was telling me that he doesn't care what his customers think.
Instead, he writes and creates for himself. If his customers like it, fine. If not, fine.
This is the gutsy statement of an artist. I pointed out to him that he's had a long line of successful books, conferences and consulting gigs. ""I don't care what they think,"" he said with a bit of contempt.
Fortunately for Richard, there's a high correlation between what he likes and what the market likes. The power of his conviction, though, is that instead of being joyful when he runs into a customer who thinks the way he does (and annoyed at those that don't), he's comfortable enough with his sense of art and craft and quality that it's enough. He does it for himself. He actively ignores the market.
If you're strong enough to do that, more power to you. If you do your art and the market rejects you, though, you need to make a choice. If your art has no market, it's still art. It just might not be a living.","February 7, 2009","artist, conviction, market"

The difference between a show and a story,"The Super Bowl hype is blissfully long gone, and lazy media outlets can no longer reprint press releases and dissect multi-million dollar wastes of time and money.
The lesson of these ads is simple. Putting on a show is expensive, time-consuming and quite fun. And it rarely works.
The Gatorade commercial, or the guy clipping his toenails or someone throwing a rock through a vending machine… it's all show biz, it's not marketing.
Marketing is telling a story that sticks, that spreads and that changes the way people act. The story you tell is far more important than the way you tell it. Don't worry so much about being cool, and worry a lot more about resonating your story with my worldview. If you don't have a story, then a great show isn't going to help much.
(And yes, every successful organization has a story, even if they've never considered running an ad, during the Super Bowl or anywhere else.)",,"show, story, marketing"
Solving a different problem,"The telephone destroyed the telegraph.
Here's why people liked the telegraph: It was universal, inexpensive, asynchronous and it left a paper trail.
The telephone offered not one of these four attributes. It was far from universal, and if someone didn't have a phone, you couldn't call them. It was expensive, even before someone called you. It was synchronous–if you weren't home, no call got made. And of course, there was no paper trail.
If the telephone guys had set out to make something that did what the telegraph does, but better, they probably would have failed. Instead, they solved a different problem, in such an overwhelmingly useful way that they eliminated the feature set of the competition.

But wait.Marketing is not the same as advertising.Advertising is a tiny slice of what marketing is today, and in fact, it's pretty clear that the marketing has to come before the product, not after. As Jon points out, the Prius was developed after the marketing thinking was done. Jones Soda, too. In fact, just about every successful product or service is the result of smart marketing thinking first, followed by a great product that makes the marketing story come true.

If everyone around you is sure the economy is tanking, that the end is near, that time is up and the company is headed for the tubes, it's almost impossible to find a creative solution.
Creativity changes the game, whatever game is being played. ""We're going to run out of cash by the end of the year,"" is accurate unless you count creativity into the equation. Then the accurate statement is, ""Under the current rules and assumptions, we're going to run out of cash…"" Big difference.

I often hear presenters who always manage to need just two more minutes than the time allows. So, instead of exiting gracefully when there's ten seconds left on the clock, they either steal time from the next person or try to rush through six slides and their conclusion.

"Email campaign case studies (one good, one bad)","In one week, I heard from two companies in the same industry. The comparison is instructive, I think.
Every month, I get a great email from Paul McGowan, founder of PS Audio. Hisnewsletteris anticipated, personal and relevant. I signed up for it and I look forward to it.
Paul mentions his products, their reviews and their new technology. He also tells stories and acts like a real person. Because I signed up for the newsletter, I open it. Because he never abuses my trust, I trust him. If I hit reply, he writes back.
When it's time to buy the sort of thing he sells, I won't look around much, because I'm already sold.
I also got two identical emails (with different subject lines) from a speaker company called Thiel Audio. I never signed up to hear from this company, and judging from the email addresses they used, they harvested my address either from an attendee list at a conference at which I spoke or from an old business card.
The problem with believing that just because you have access to an address you have the right to mail is that there is no friction with email. It's free. You can email a million people in a heartbeat, costing the recipients time (and thus money) and you not much of either. The recipient knows this, and feels exploited or cheated. It's not fair, and so the lack of friction backfires. The very ease of interruption makes the interruption more annoying.
I get a lot of spam from non-reputable companies, but it was surprising to get this html ad via email from a company that used to have a good reputation.
My email box is where I live all day. They showed up, uninvited, and worked to sell me something even though they had no connection with me as a consumer or a blogger. That's not brand building, it's the opposite. Even worse, it's undependable.
With PS Audio, Paul realizes that over time, the more months I get the newsletter, the greater the chance I'm going to trust and like and buy from him. For Thiel, the opposite is true. The more they send, the more people will get in the habit of deleting or unsubscribing. It's not an asset, it's a risk. It doesn't scale, it shrinks.
No doubt, there are old-school marketers who will talk about their right to email or interrupt because it's not against the law, or perhaps it generates short-term sales. The thing is, consumers now have rights too. The right to ignore, to distrust and to choose someone else when it comes time to spend money.
There are a hundred ways to skulk around, to collect email addresses, to write clever privacy policies or to argue about whether opt-out (""you can always unsubscribe!"") is a valid way to build a brand. None of those schemes work. What works is exactly one way: making promises and then keeping them.

A spam campaign feels like a smart idea, but over time, the more you use it, the less your brand is worth.A permission campaign, on the other hand, only grows in value, until it gets big enough that you can build an entire business around it.

Why aren’t you (really) good at graphic design?,"Ten years ago, you had a wide range of excuses for being a lousy visuals person. Starting with no talent, leading to no skill and going from there.
But now, in a world where it is expected that professionals will be able to make beautiful powerpoint slides, handsome business cards, clever bio photos and a decent website, it's as important as driving. And easier to learn and do, and requiring less talent.
No, you and I will never be gifted designers or breakthrough designers. But there's really no reason not to be really good.
I put together apage with some blogs, books and sitesyou can check out. An hour a day for a month and you won't have to hide your face in shame. Sure, hire the very best in the world when you need a breakthrough. But you don't have to pay for better-than-mediocre design. You can do it yourself.
(Update: as expected, I heard from a few designers, upset that I would recommend that anyone do pretty good design. The thing is, as a designer, if all you can offer is a time-saving way to get pretty good design, that's a tough row to hoe. The magic for thegreatdesigner is that once someone understands how to see, understands how powerful great design can be… they are going to be the first person who wants to hire you.
The fact is, business people do copywriting, simple legal and accounting work and more, on their own, every day. You compose your own email, don't you? If your legal decisions were as bad as your design, you'd get fired in a minute for libeling people. Getting pretty good at things is merely a first step, but one that you need to take in order to be ready to spend the money to get great.)","March 31, 2009","graphic design, self-improvement, design skills"
"Share of wallet, share of wall, share of voice","The first mistake marketers make is that they want more. More customers, more noise, more ads, more shelf space, more customers, more customers, more customers…
Almost all of their actions are driven by the search for more customers.
The reason this is a mistake is simple: it's expensive. Attracting a new customer costs far more than keeping an old one happy. Not only that, but an old customer is far more likely to bring you new people via word of mouth than someone who isn't even a customer yet.
Which is why share of wallet makes so much more sense than share of market. How much does each of your existing customers buy from you? Do they count on you for all the things they buy in this market, or just some? Does Toyota sell me every car my family drives? Does Chubb get to insure every single thing I own? Usually not. Because marketers are so focused on more that they forget to take great care of what they've got.
Hugh Macleod,gifted cartoonist and profane marketing blogger is now making his living selling limited edition art work based on his cartoons. He's a brilliant marketer, of course, so he's not focused on more. He's focused on share of wallet. On selling his dedicated fans a remarkable souvenir that they can keep and display.
So, what's the problem? Share of wall. Unlike records or shoes, it's hard to buy a lot of art. Pretty soon, you've got no place left to put it, do you? Share of wallet turns into share of wall and you can't grow any more.
That's why you need to be realistic about how much share of wallet you can honestly expect, and why job one is delighting existing customers so much that they can't help but tell their friends. Preferably friends with very big houses.","March 30, 2009","share of wallet, customer retention, marketing strategy"
Ignore your critics,"If you find 100 comments on a blog post or 100 reviews of a new book or 100 tweets about you…
and two of them are negative, while 98 are positive…
which ones are you going to read first?
If you're a human being and you're telling the truth, the answer is pretty obvious: you want to know which misguided losers had nasty things to say and you want to know what they said. In fact, if we're being totally truthful, it's likely you're going to take what the critics had to say to heart.
That's a shame. The critics are never going to be happy with you, that's why they're critics. You might bore them by doing what they say… but that won't turn them into fans, it will merely encourage them to go criticize someone else.
It doesn't matter what Groucho or Elvis or Britney or any other one-name performer does or did… the critics won't be placated. Changing your act to make them happy is a fool's game.
Here's a surprising thought, though. You should ignore your fans as well.
Your fans don't want you to change, your fans want you to maintain the essence of what you bring them but add a laundry list of features. You fans want lower prices and more contributions, bigger portions and more frequent deliveries.
So, who should you listen to?
Your sneezers.

The high road and the low road,"Why spend $10,000 to do a photo shoot for a magazine? After all, all your profit is in the ads.
Sometimes it seems like people who build websites and magazines that take the high road aren't paying any attention at all to conversion and revenue and manipulation.
The low road of media ought to work. After all, it's filled with tricks that have been tested and shown to work. On a website, a pop up, a popunder, a cloaked IP address, a persistent window that won't go away, loud headlines and calls to action… all of these things should convert.
We saw the same thing with magazines over the last few decades. You can fill a magazine with come ons, get rich quick claims and guaranteed results… and yet Conde Nast (home of The New Yorker) and other high road publications made more money and had happier advertisers…
The reason manipulative media doesn't work as well as you might expect is that people have a choice. Sure, on a per thousand basis, the manipulative tricks you might decide to use seem to work,but people don't have to show up in the first place.Generally, the people who do show up for these low road attempts at manipulation aren't the right people to begin with.
I see this every day at Squidoo, blogs and other user generated pages. People who build pages that are generous, filled with useful information and generally focused on teaching people do extremely well. They get a lot of traffic, a ton of clickthroughs and earn money every day. And yet, countless businesses in search of a quick buck show up with obviously selfish scams involving Forex and affiliate-Bank and 'exclusive' offers. And they fail, again and again. They fail because people who have a choice don't participate.
Data is your friend. And the data shows that the top blogs, top lenses, top magazines… they all follow the high road. If you need to be manipulative or non-transparent to make a buck, time to rethink the plan.","March 27, 2009","High road, Manipulative media, User-generated content"

The right size,"I've been thinking a lot about issues ofscaleandunits of measure.Many businesses that are in trouble are in trouble for a simple reason: they're the wrong size.
A newspaper that only had a few dozen employees would be doing great today. But they have hundreds or thousands of employees because that was an appropriate scale twenty years ago. When I started my first web company fifteen years ago, the idea that you could be successful with six or ten employees was crazy, but today many of the mostsuccessfulcompanies have not many more than that. That's 15,000 fewer employees than eBay has.
It's tempting to get bigger. But is bigger better? In many cases, it's worse, particularly when you can leverage reliable systems that are cheaper and faster and more stable in the outside world. If you can make your product better by assembling it yourself, you should. But if that action makes it worse, why do it?
Which leads to the idea of figuring out what the unit of manufacture or delivery is. Do you deliver the entire solution or just a piece of it? Twitter delivers a sentence, sandwiched in between two other people's sentences. A blog delivers a series of longer pieces, sandwiched in between other pieces by the same person. A website delivers page after page of pieces, all from the same organization. What's the unit that works right now?
Creative Computing delivered an MP3 player. That was the unit. Apple changed this and delivered the player, the software, the music store, the headphonesandthe retail outlet. Both sold music, ultimately, but Apple choose a far wider unit. Very risky, but it worked.
The flip side works as well. If you want Konacoffeein Senseo pods, the web makes it easy to find. Aloha doesn't have to subsidize the cost of the entire system, worry about shelf space or build coffee makers. They can just make a profit from a small piece of the entire system.
Ford Motor used to hire shepherds to tend Ford sheep on Ford land so they could weave Ford fabric to put on the seats of Ford cars. Today, of course, that's crazy. One day soon there will be car companies that have 200 employees.
So many businesses are stuck on tradition. What happens to your agency or brokerage or factory or freelance practice when you make the unit of measure bigger? smaller? Why are you assuming that your scale is correct?","March 25, 2009","scale, size, business strategy"

A chance to join the online triiibe,"Five months ago, I built a social network on Ning. No ads, all free. I briefly opened it to the readers of this blog as a place to talk about leadership and connection. A few thousand people bought my book and signed up. Since then, there have been hundreds of thousands of posts and connections and stories. The plan was to run it as a closed community and then open it once we laid a foundation of connections and content.
Well, the group that orginally homesteaded the site has agitated to keep it as a closed community. I can't disagree. In fact, the password-protected, non-anonymous nature of this community makes it work. People hesitate to spam or troll because they know they'll get kicked out and won't be able to return. They talk to one another with respect because it's really them, and they're really there.
I've decided to let a few more people join in order to keep things fresh and growing. The only requirements:1. To be fair, you need to have purchased at least one copy ofTribes, just like everyone else there.and2. It's a promotion-free zone. If you attempt to sell things or sites or anything, we'll ask you to leave.
[NOW CLOSED AGAIN! I got a huge response, there are some amazing people, and I'm closing the group again for a few months to let the tribe coalesce again. I apologize if you missed the window]. I'm only going to keep it open for a day or so. If you don't get an invitation from me, it's because Ning's invites often end up in spam filters.

The myth of big salaries (it’s all marketing),"The failed bankers on Wall Street have been whining that if they have to cut bonuses and salaries dramatically, they'll be unable to recruit great talent, and they need great talent to fix the situation.
And for years, boards have been claiming that they need to pay CEOs $50,000,000 salaries in order to recruit the very best for their companies.
Jamie Dimon at Chase said, ""It's possible someone's going to walk in my office and say, Jamie, I have a family. I can't afford to live that way.""
This, of course, is nonsense.
After a million dollars or so in salary, theabsoluteamount that a person is paid has no real impact on their life. They can't eat more meals in a day or wear more shoes. What matters to the manager is therelativeamount. How much more would I make over there? Why does that company pay its CEO more than my company pays me?
(Aside: should the guys who drive an armored car that carries millions of dollars in bonds get paid more than the guys that drive an armored car that only carries thousands of dollars in cash? Does the amount of money handled change the difficult of the work?)
Twenty years ago, financial industry salaries were a tiny fraction of what they are today. Did lesser people do the work? Did they try less hard? Think smaller thoughts? Of course not. The reasons salaries are high is that the number is asignaling mechanism, a very expensive marketing campaign.
Law firms went through this cycle twenty years ago. The top firms competed with each other to recruit a too-small pool of talent from the top law schools. Unable to muster up even a mite of marketing insight, they chose to compete on only one axis: salary. So, 24 year olds were given jobs at $120,000 a year, when their peers from college were making 20% of that. The firms could have found great people at half the price, except that with only one axis, they had to be at the top if their peers were.
If you were a law student, the choice was easy. Either you got a job at a firm that proved its worth by paying a lot or you didn't. You didn't have to know anything about the firm, apparently, other than the fact that they were top tier, and the way you knew that was because they paid a lot.
Hence the current situation with CEOs and bankers. There's no real effort made to market the jobs, just to race to the top (or the bottom, depending on your point of view) with the easiest marketing signal of all. Price. Yes, it's exactly the same as a retailer trying to improve business by being the cheapest.
In addition to this being a huge (!) waste of money, it's also provably false as an accurate portrayal of what's necessary to recruit. For every great job at Goldman Sachs, there are still 1,000 totally qualified applicants waiting for that job. So, when demand is high and supply is low, the power goes to the supplier. Lower the salary until you get just a few qualified applicants, right?
This moment in our economic cycle is a great opportunity for shareholders and taxpayers to let the organizations we own and support know that wasting money on this sort of marketing is silly. Just as an industry-wide gas standard would have actually helped Detroit twenty years ago, an industry-wide tax and trade salary cap will actually help these organizations. They'll be forced to recruit with useful marketing techniques (I'd rather work at an innovative, fast-moving, respectful company, given the choice…so the companies would have to make a better 'product,' not just pay a lot as a result of financial engineering).
[I think performance pay is great, risk should be rewarded and stock options are just fine. I also think it's fine for risk-takers and skilled pros to make a ton of money. I'm mostly talking about guaranteed bonuses which aren't bonuses at all, just a bribe to sign on and stay on.]
Sometimes markets get stuck because there is a disconnect between what something costs and what you get. It costs the individuals on the board of a public company nothing to pay more, they get bragging rights and a CEO who is focused on money. And that works until the next board leapfrogs them. The boards themselves should be lobbying to end this practice, but they won't because… guess what… the folks on the boards are the CEOs of other companies. It's stuck.
If you are a relentless free market believer, more power to you. If your company is private, pay yourself a trillion dollars a year, fine with me. In fact, we need more private companies that innovate and pay their staff a ton. But if you're owned by shareholders or bailed out by taxpayers, wasting trillions of dollars because you don't have the guts to market your jobs properly is silly.",,"Salaries, Market Signaling, Recruitment"
License to stall,"In business to business sales, you will encounter three kinds of people:
You have no chance (zero) of moving someone from one category to another. The reason this system evolved is straightforward: the yes people are rare in a typical organization, because they have responsibility and power. So they are busy and need to be protected. The no people are easy to train at saying no, and they're waiting to be promoted to yes people. And the stallers? They represent the dip, the barrier salespeople have to get through to show that they are serious.
This is true for all business to business selling, but I think it's worthwhile to consider ad sales.
In today's long tail new media world, I think that marketers that rely on this system are failing. When there were only a few media options worth considering when placing an ad, the stalling, no-ing and eventually yes-please system didn't hurt them much. NBC had the wherewithal to get through the system. Yahoo and AOL organized to get through it as well. A marketer could just arrogantly wait for the best salespeople and buy ads from them and succeed.
Now, though, there are thousands of sites that could offer your organization targeted, efficient media that would pay off handsomely at the price you are willing to buy it.
Look at it from the blogger's point of view: If you're a blogger, would you sell a monthly sponsorship on your blog for $2,000? $20,000? Probably, and it would be a bargain for both sides. But you don't even try, because the overhead is huge.The cost of selling that sponsorship is more than you'd earn.
So, Visa, a stalling marketer, spent a million or more dollars on a very expensive, complex and largely ineffective online promotion last month–not because it was likely to work, but because it was well sold by persistent and effective salespeople. They should have sponsored your blog and 400 others instead.
The opportunity for marketers in search of media is not to play defense, to stall people with clever ideas or small platforms, but instead to stop stalling and start looking. The bargains are there, just waiting.","March 22, 2009","B2B sales, marketing strategies, ad sales"
"Yeah, but he really knows his stuff…","Every organization worth its salt has at least one guy like this. Someone who knows every technical detail, or has vast expertise in the parliamentary procedure. Perhaps he's the coot who knows every verse of the Bible or is the only one with a Master's license. Maybe he's the guy (the only guy) who can fix that big machine.
And he's a jerk.
He's the first one to point out a minor technical glitch and the last guy to want to get on board with a new program. He hazes first-timers and avoids the people who are actually productive. Or he's the one who can take any metaphor and make it literal, instantly, poking holes in it as he goes.

Advice on equity,"A friend asked me to help him think about how to split the equity in a company he was starting. His colleague is contributing office space and some key technology. My friend is responsible for where the business goes from here. I told him this:
If you apportion equity, you will certainly do it wrong.
That's because it's based on a snapshot, a moment in time.
Sure, today, your partner's share is worth 50% and yours is worth 50%. His because of what he did, yours because of what you're going to do.
But a year from now, that number can't possibly be right. You may have acquired six more pieces of software, raised millions, traveled the world, closed sales and sold the company. Wow. Or, you may have done absolutely nothing.
So, my best advice is to say, ""Today, right now, your contribution is worth 5% of the company and my creation of the company is worth 5%. The other 90% is based on what each of us does over the next 18 months. Here's a list of what has to get done, and what we agree it's worth…""
And then make a list. Stuff like commenting and updating and supporting the code. Stuff like closing sales and hiring people and raising money…
Of course, you leave an out for unforeseen events and dilution based on bringing in new partners.
You may end up having small disagreements about how to interpret the list, but this sort of advance flexibility is well worth the awkward conversation it takes to get it started. Another tip: put in a clause appointing a trusted third party as an arbitrator, so small disagreements don't snowball into litigation.","March 19, 2009","equity split, contributions, flexibility"
The benefits of history,"Marketers are good at looking ahead. We predict/create the future, working to build an idea or a product into something that will matter more tomorrow than it does today.
The focus on the future, though, encourages us to take our attention away from what has worked in the past. The next time someone tells you that they've seen a UFO, ask them about thisarticle. A look at a hundred years of UFOs and bigfoots and other things that were certain to change everything shows that they never have. Don't even get me started with thehistoryof astrology.
My question to marketers with a huge idea, something that will change everything, is, ""tell me about how someone has done this before."" Of course there are first-time-ever groundbreaking exceptions that change the rules forever. But my guess is that you'd rather have a launch or a concept that can follow in the conceptual footsteps of what came before.
Every two years, teenage girls fall in love with an irresistible fashion fad. If you develop the next one, you can look at the last six for clues about how it works.
Every once in a while, a new technology is introduced online and it becomes the must-have, must-be-talked-about breakthrough. If you've got one of those, it would be useful to look at what made the last five work.
Every two weeks, there's a surprise bestseller in the bookstore. Surely we can learn from that process.
But, if all you've got is a lot of confidence and nothing to point to in the past, forgive me for being a bit skeptical. Hopeful, sure, but skeptical.","March 18, 2009","history, marketing, innovation"
Where have all the agents gone?,"Travel agents… gone.Stock brokers… gone.Real estate brokers… in trouble. Photographer's agents, too.Literary agents?
The problem with being a helpful, efficient but largely anonymous middleman is pretty obvious. Someone can come along who is cheaper, faster and more efficient. And that someone might be the customer aided by a computer.
The airlines don't want to pay travel agents, because the travel agents were making more money on each flight than they were. Some house sellers hesitate to pay real estate brokers because they don't believe the 6% payment is an opportunity, they see it as a tax. Investors abandoned full service stock brokers because trading stocks directly is faster and more accurate than using the phone.
Middlemen add value when they bring taste or judgment or trust to bear on a transaction that isn't transparent. Literary agents are crucial when publishers believe that their choice of content is essential but have too many choices and too little time. But publishers don't trust every literary agent. They trust agents they believe in. Key point:anonymous agents are interchangeable and virtually worthless.Agents that don't do anything but help one side find the other side in a human approximation of Google aren't so helpful any more.
Think about how anonymous the typical real estate broker is. He will sell almost any house or represent almost any buyer. When selling a house, he has a fiduciary responsibility to represent that house to the best of his ability. Just like every other broker. The great real estate brokers do far more than this.
Travel agents still survive, but in a very different way than they used to. Now, the best ones are paid by the traveler, not the airline. The best ones provide a differentiated service that is worth paying for. Instead of being middlemen, then, they are the front men, the attraction, a key asset to the traveler.
To thrive in a world of self-service, agents have to hyperspecialize, have to stand for something, have to have the guts to say no far more than they say yes. No, you can't publish this book. No I won't represent you. No, don't take that flight. No, I won't sell this house, it's overpriced, list it yourself.
The second thing agents must do to make a smart transition is to consider who they are selling to. Should talent agents only sell to Hollywood? Literary agents only to book publishers? Should ad agencies specialize in Google Adwords, not just Super Bowl spots? When markets change, agents can lead the way, not follow along grudgingly.","March 17, 2009","agents, middlemen, specialization"
Linear and parallel,"The internet loves parallel projects.
Linux development is parallel. Thousands of people can work on it at once, none of them waiting in line. Wikipedia is parallel, because a large group can go at millions of articles, side by side. TheYouTube Orchestraauditions were parallel too, because you didn't have to wait in line to practice or apply.
Parallel is faster and more efficient. The Huffington Post will always outperform a traditional news site because they have 3,000 contributors, not a few dozen.
If you want to make a buffet go faster, all you need to do is move the serving table away from the wall and let people serve themselves from either side. If you want to go faster still, use two tables.
Self-service customer support outperforms the traditional model because people don't have to wait in line.
Your organization probably isn't parallel. There are bottlenecks throughout, and finding them and making them parallel could change everything.
There's one place you don't want to be parallel, at least at first: sales.
When you are linear in your sales process, you learn something. You don't make the same mistake on each and every call. Instead, you make a few mistakes on your first call, then a few less and then, finally, you get it as right as you're going to get it. That is when you go parallel, not before.","March 16, 2009","Parallel projects, efficiency, sales process."
What’s your super power?,"When I was a kid, I loved the Legion of Super Heroes and the Justice League of America. These were comics for slumming comic book writers, fun and sort of stupid stories where a whole bunch of superheroes would get together, hang out in the clubhouse and then work together to destroy some sort of monster that any individual superhero could never have bested.
Anyway, near the beginning of most of these comics was a scene where a stranger would meet the team. Inevitably, the heroes would introduce themselves. Of course, Batman or Superman wouldn't need an introduction, but the lesser (lower rent) heroes had to speak up and describe their super power.
""I'm the Wasp. I have the ability to shrink to a height of several centimeters, fly bymeans of insectoid wings and fireenergy blasts.""
Some fancy marketers might call this a positioning statement or a unique selling proposition. Of course, it's not that. It's just her super power.
When you meet someone, you need to have a super power. If you don't, you're just another handshake. Don't say, ""Hi, I'm Don, I'm from Cleveland."" Instead, try, ""Hi, I'm Don, I tell stories that spread."" It's not about touting yourself or coming on too strong. It's about making the introduction meaningful. If I don't know your superpower, then I don't know how you can help me (or I can help you).
I was sitting next to a guy at a conference a few years ago. When people went around and said who they were and what they did, he said, ""I'm Stephen, I'm a judge."" He gets points for humility, and not pointing out that he was a Supreme Court Justice was certainly his privilege…  sort of like Superman not having to tout his x-ray vision.

Regardless of your feelings about the historical accuracy of the story, it's an interesting question: why create an impossible mission like that? Why encourage people who might travel 100 miles over their entire lifetime to undertake a quest to find, capture, kill, skin and eventually tan a dolphin?
My friend Adam had an interesting take on this. He told me that the acquisition of the leather is irrelevant. It was the quest that mattered. Having a community-based quest means that there's less room for whining, for infighting and for dissolution. Having a mission not only points everyone in the same direction, it also creates motion. And motion in any direction is often better than no motion at all.
All around you, people are telling you two things:1. whatever you want, forget it, it's impossible,and2. sit still, preserve resources, lay low.
And yet, the people who are succeeding, creating change and (not coincidentally) are happier aren't listening to either of these pieces of advice. Instead, they're on the search for dolphin leather.
Frank Sinatra had it wrong. Your dream shouldn't be impossible, but it sure helps if it's improbable. Don't choose your dreams based on what is certain to happen, choose them based on what's likely to cause the change you want to occur around you.","March 11, 2009","dolphin leather, quest, dreams"
The difference between PR and publicity,"Most PR firms do publicity, not PR.
Publicity is the act of getting ink. Publicity is getting unpaid media to pay attention, write you up, point to you, run a picture, make a commotion. Sometimes publicity is helpful, and good publicity is always good for your ego.
But it's not PR.
PR is the strategic crafting of your story. It's the focused examination of your interactions and tactics and products and pricing that, when combined, determine what and how people talk about you.
Regis McKenna was great at PR. Yes, he got Steve Jobs and the Mac on the cover of more than 30 magazines in the year it launched. That was just publicity. The real insight was crafting the story of the Mac (and yes, the story of Steve Jobs).
If you send out a boring press release, your publicity effort will probably fail, but your PR already has.
A publicity firm will tell you stories of how they got a client ink. A PR firm will talk aboutstorytellingand being remarkable and spreading the word. They might even suggest you don't bother getting ink or issuing press releases.
In my experience, a few people have a publicity problem, but almost everyone has a PR problem. You need to solve that one first. And you probably won't accomplish that if you hire a publicity firm and don't even give them the freedom and access they need to work with you on your story.","March 10, 2009","PR, publicity, storytelling"
Slack,"A lot of corporations have seen dramatic decreases in revenue and have cut back projects as well. In many cases, this is accompanied by layoffs, and so everyone is working far harder.
But in other organizations, and for a lot of freelancers, there's more time than work. In other words, slack time.
Assume for a moment you don't have money to develop and launch something new. So, what are you going to do with the slack?
What can you build over the next year that will take time now and pay off later? How can you invest the slack to build a marketing asset that you'll own forever?
May I offer two suggestions:
1. Learn something. Become an expert. For free, using nothing but time, you can become a master of CSS or HTML or learn Python. You can hit the library and read the entire works of important authors, or you can borrow some books from a friend and master Analytics or discover case studies and corporate histories that will be invaluable in a year. You could learn to become fluent in Spanish…
If you're a glass blower without a job, you can't do much glass blowing. But if you're a digital marketer between gigs, you can do a lot of digital marketing… build a tribe for your favorite non-profit and make it a case-study for an entire industry.
2. Earn a following and reputation. Use social networking tools to connect to people for no good reason. Post tons of useful answers on discussion boards where your expertise is valued. Build a permission asset in the form of an email newsletter or a fascinating blog that people want to read. Do resume makeovers for 100 friends. Start a neighborhood or industry book group. Don't go to conventions, earn the right to speak at them.
If you were as serious about these two endeavors as you are about doing your job (eight hours a day on a slow day), imagine how much more powerful and in demand you'll be a year from now.
Beats the alternative, by far.","March 9, 2009","Slack time, skill development, professional networking"
Return on Design,"Return on investment is easy to measure. You put money in, you measure money out, divide and prosper.
But return on design? (Design: graphics, system engineering, user interface etc.)
Design can take money and time and guts, and what do you get in return? It turns out that the sort of return you're getting (and hoping for) will drive the decisions you make about design.
I think there are four zones of return that are interesting to think about. I find it's more useful to look at them as distinct states as opposed to a graduated line, because it's easy to spend a lot of time and money on design but not move up in benefits the way you might expect. Crest might have a better package than Colgate (or the other way around, I can't remember), but it doesn't sell any more units…
Negative return.The local store with the boarded up window, the drooping sign and the peeling paint is watching their business suffer because they have a design that actually hurts them. Software products suffer from this ailment often. If the design actively gets in the way of the story you tell or the utility you deliver, you lose money and share.
No impact.Most design falls into this category. While aesthetically important, design in this case is just a matter of taste, not measurable revenue. You might not like the way the liquor store looks, or the label on that bottle of wine, but it's not having any effect on sales. It's good enough.Positive return.We're seeing a dramatic increase in this category. Everything from a bag of potato chips to an online web service can generate incremental sales and better utility as a result of smart design.The whole thing.There are a few products where smart designisthe product (or at least the product's reason for being). If you're not in love with the design of a Porsche 911, you would never consider buying it–same as an OXO peeler.  The challenge of building your product around breakthrough design is that the design has to in fact be a breakthrough. And that means spending far more time or money than your competitors who are merely seeking a positive return.
Knowing where you stand and where you're headed is critical. If you have a negative return on design, go ahead and spend enough money to get neutral, asap. But don't spend so much that you're overinvesting just to get to neutral. Watching a local store build an expensive but not stellar custom building is the perfect example of this mismatch.
If you're betting the whole thing, building your service launch on design first, skimping on design is plain foolish.The Guggenheim in Bilbao would be empty if they'd merely hired a very good architect.","March 8, 2009","Return on Design, investment, design impact"
How far away is your emergency?,"It's amazing that people have so much time to fret about today's emergency but almost no time at all to avoid tomorrow's.
A glimpse at the TV and internets shows one talking head after another angsting about today's economy. These are the same people who needed to devote entire hours to mindless trivia nine months ago when they could have done an enormous amount of education about avoiding this mess in the first place.
Six years ago, I gave a mildly controversial talk to the newspaper publishers at an annual convention. I explained in detail why they were just a few years from bankruptcy and how they could use the momentum and assets they had to build up a hyperlocal internet presence and permission asset now, because it would be too late when the emergency hit. Of course, my talk wasn't an emergency, they had other priorities, and so the dire prediction comes true.
When gas is $10 a gallon (and it certainly will be), we'll have plenty of time to obsess about what we can't change and what a mess our world is. So I wonder…Where are the groundbreaking reports about how this device or that organization are wasting so much energy today, when we can still do something about it? Why not shine a light on the holes we're digging today as opposed to the canyons we'll have to deal with years from now?
They say the best time to look for a job is when you don't need one. And the best time to invest in a new Purple Cow is when you're still milking the old one. Move your emergency back in time and you'll be amazed at how far your money goes.","March 7, 2009","emergency preparedness, future planning, economic forewarning"
Direct from consumer marketing,"Drug companies have coined an acronym for the marketing they do that bypasses doctors: DTC. Direct to consumer. Those happy face ads you see in Readers Digest and other magazines, or the erectile dysfunction ads during the Super Bowl.
What they are totally unprepared for, and what your organization may be unprepared for is Directfromconsumer.
If someone takes your medicine and gets sick, do you want to hear from them, or would you rather have them blog about it or make a video?
Most drug company marketers instantly say, ""we want to hear from them!""
Really?
When your airline or hotel has a passenger or guest who is so angry he could spit, do you want to hear from him or do you want him to make a long Powerpoint that spreads around the whole web? Really?
And when your cable company or chiropractic clinic or consulting firm has a disappointed client, what about you? Really?
I think the actions of almost all marketers say, ""we'd rather you were happy, but if you can't be happy, please go away.""
If you really want me to call you, then put your toll free number in giant type on the label. (If you run a free service, Google style, I think it's okay to settle for an easy to use and responsive web presence). Answer the call on the first ring. No phone tree. And give me instant sympathy, maybe a little empathy too. Don't blame me or evade. Give me a refund. And say sorry and thank you.
""Oh,"" the powerful marketers say, ""we could never do that."" Two reasons, apparently. First, they say, because it would encourage people to pretend they were angry in order to take advantage. And second, they say, because it would be too expensive.
Compared to what?
Back when every consumer was alone, you could ignore the few angry ones and use the money you saved to run more ads. But now? Now in the DFC era, do you really have any choice?
Angry phone calls are your friend. They're your friend because the alternative is angry tweets and angry blog posts.","March 6, 2009","Direct to Consumer, DTC Marketing, Consumer Feedback"
The two elements of a great presenter,"1. Respect (fromthe audience)2. Love (tothe audience)
There are no doubt important evolutionary reasons why this is true, but in my experience, every great presenter earns the respect of the audience (through her appearance, reputation, posture, voice, slides, introduction, etc.) and captures the attention of the audience by sending them love.
Love takes many forms. I love you enough to teach you this. I love you enough to help you. I love you enough to look you in the eye. Or, in the case of rock and roll presentations, I love you enough to want to engage in various acts with you, right now, backstage.
Margaret Thatcher was a great presenter, even though she had none of the glib charisma people expect from someone with that title. That's because people (even those that disagreed with her) respected her before she started, and they understood at every moment that her motivation was to motivate and improve the lives of those she was presenting to.
In the famous interrogation scene in Basic Instinct (link not included so no one yells at me), Sharon Stone does a brilliant presentation. She instantly earns (a sort of) respect from the cops and their undivided attention at the same time. She replaces love with sex, and it works.
Tony Robbins is considered an astounding presenter for a similar reason. His stage presence and reputation and energy and sheer size earn him respect, and his generosity and complete connection with the audience is received by them as love. The result is a connection far bigger than the content alone would account for.
If you have love but no respect, you're a lounge singer. Fail.
If you have respect, but no love, you're like one of the rare self-promotional talks at TED. Fail.
Consider thisclipfrom Patton. In 28 seconds, George C. Scott delivers both.
When you create a presentation, think about what your status will be as you begin the presentation. What can you do to prewire, to earn more respect from the start? How can you be introduced? Lit? Miked? What can you wear?If your reputation doesn't precede you, how do you earn it?
Don't apologize at the beginning of the talk. For anything. Don't hide in the dark. Don't hide behind a wall of bullet points.
And then, as the talk (pitch/presentation/interview) begins, don't focus your energy or concern on yourself. It's not about you. It's about them.The presenter who loves his audience the most, wins.","March 5, 2009","Presentation, Respect, Love"
Three kinds of meetings,"Meetings are marketing in real time with real people. (A conference is not a meeting. A conference is a chance for a circle of people to interact).
There are only three kinds of classic meetings:
PLEASE don't confuse them. Confused meeting types are the number one source of meeting ennui. One source of confusion is that a meeting starts as one sort of meeting and then magically morphs into another kind. The reason this is frightening is that one side or the other might not realize that's actually occurring. If it does, stop and say, ""Thanks for the discussion. Let me state what we've just agreed on and then we can go ahead and approve it, okay?""
While I'm at it, let me remind you that there are two kinds of questions.
There's room for both types of questions, particularly in a team preparing for a presentation or a pitch. Again, don't confuse them. I like to be sure that there's time for the first type, then, once everyone acknowledges that they know what's on the table, open it up for the second, more debate-oriented type of question.","March 4, 2009","meetings, communication, questions"
How big is your world?,"Is everything okay?
Well, do you mean in my house? My neighborhood? The home office of my company? The entire industry?
Thanks to airplanes, television and the internet, the scope of our experience continues to widen. Now, we're concerned about wildfires in Australia or failing banks in the UK. Now, we celebrate when conjoined twins are saved a few continents away, and join in the search for a missing adventurer in a place we've never been.
But, there's a difference between being aware of the emergency of the day and having firsthand experience and firsthand empathy for different people in different places.
My friendJacqueline Novogratz, founder of the Acumen Fund, is at the forefront of making the world smaller. She has the unique ability to combine the financial and the spiritual in a way that does justice to both.
Her new book,The Blue Sweater,publishes in the United States this week. It's the work of a passionate amateur, an honest memoir of someone who has lived a life most of us can only dream of. When you read of Jacqueline's experiences as a naive banker newly arrived in Africa, or her extraordinary efforts to connect people of similar spirit but different cultures, you can't help but become emotionally involved in the positive energy that's spreading everywhere.
It may seem like this book has little to do with what I write about all day, or what you focus on in your work, but nothing could be further from the truth. No matter what you do, the smaller world is coming to your doorstep. No matter how you spend your day, the living, breathing, interacting big world is going to touch your private one.
An anonymous donor has put up $75,000 in a matching grant–if you buy the book this week,$15 will be donated to Acumen (for each of the first 5,000 copies sold). I hope you'll take advantage and order a copy today. Thanks.

Looking for yes,"I hate going to the post office in the town next to mine. Every time I go, they look for a reason not to ship my package. ""Too much tape!"" ""Not enough tape!"" ""There's a logo!""
On the other hand, I really enjoy the few times I have something weird to ship fast… and I bring it to Fedex. The guy at the desk has a totally different approach. He's not looking for a reason to say no, he's looking for an opportunity to say yes. ""Here's some tape, we'll just add it right here…""
The obvious reason is that the person at this post office has no incentive to make a sale. Okay, fine. But why doesn't she? Why is it okay to have employees in any organization who look for a no? It turns out that the post office in my little town has a few yes men, people who look for a reason to ship my package even though they work for a big government bureaucracy.
The same thing happens with the tech crew before I give a speech. About 75% of the time, the lead tech guy (it always seems to be a guy) explains why it's impossible. Impossible to use a Mac, impossible to use the kind of microphone I like, impossible to use my own clicker, etc. And then, the rest of the time, using the same technology, the producer asks, ""how can I help make this work for us?"" and everything is about yes, not no.
I don't think it should matter whether or not you're trying to make a profit. If you're out to provide a service, or organized to deliver a product, then look for a yes. At every interaction.","March 2, 2009","customer service, yes attitude, problem-solving"
Beware of trade guilds maintaining the status quo,"I am not a member of the Author's Guild.
Please don't blame me for their ludicrous positions. They have spoken out against public libraries, against used book stores online and now,againstthe Kindle reading books aloud.
I used to have a record label, but I never joined the RIAA. You know, the guys that under Hilary Rosen made the multi-billion dollar mistake of trying to maintain the status quo by suing their users as a way of stopping file sharing. It's hard to overestimate how damaging relying on this single action was to an entire industry.
I've eaten in restaurants, but I don't support the New York State Restaurant Association, which has spoken out against banning smoking in restaurants (it will wipe us out!) and now are giving the New York City health department ahard timefor wanting to post easy-to-understand ratings of restaurant cleanliness.
I drive a car, but I deplore the lobbying the car companies did to fight fuel efficiency rules–the very rules that would have transformed their industry and raised their profits.
Whenever a trade association raises the barricades and tries to lobby their way into maintaining the status quo, they are doing their members a disservice. Instead of spending time and insight and effort reinventing what they do and organizing for a better future, the members are lulled into a sense of security that somehow, somehow, the future will be just like today.
The key takeaway isn't that the lobbying doesn't work (though it usually doesn't). The problem is that the lobbying takes your attention away from the changes you can actually control and implement. Simple example: why doesn't the NYSRA have a staff of unofficial inspectors who help their members get an A when the real inspector comes around? Why didn't the RIAA help the record industry figure out how to transform into an industry that would embrace and leverage file sharing?

A million blind squirrels,"My dad likes to say, ""even a blind squirrel finds an acorn now and then."" And it's true. You shouldn't pick your strategy by modeling someone else's success. The success might have been strategic and planned, but it's just as likely to be a matter of blind luck. Someone had to get that big deal, and this time it was him.
The numbing reality of the net is that now we can see all the blind squirrels, all the time. A recentpiecein the Times talked about bloggers getting six figure book deals in just a few weeks after posting community-driven goofy websites. It's easy to read this and say, ""I should do that! I could do that!""
What's missing from the article is that for every 10,000 goofy websites that get launched, one turns into a six-figure book deal and the other 9,999 fade away. If you want to build a goofy website, go for it. Just don't expect to be the lucky squirrel.","April 30, 2009","blind luck, strategy, success"
Infinity–they keep making more of it,"If you had a little business in a little town, there was a natural limit to your growth. You hit a limit on strangers (no people left to pitch), some became friends, some became customers and you then went delivered as much as you could to this core audience. Every day wasn't spent trying to get bigger.
There's no limit now. No limit to how many clicks, readers, followers and friends you can acquire.
I don't think this new mindset is better. It shortchanges the customers you have now (screw them, if they can't take a joke, we'll just replace them!) and worse, it means you're never done. Instead of getting better, you focus obsessively on getting bigger.
You're at a conference, talking to someone who matters to you. Over their shoulder, you see a new, bigger, better networking possibility. So you scamper away. It's about getting bigger.
Compared to what? You're never going to be the biggest, so it seems like being better is a reasonable alternative.
The problem with getting bigger is that getting bigger costs you. Not just in time and money, but in focus and standards and principles. Moving your way to the biggest part of the curve means appealing to an ever broader audience, becoming (by definition) more average.
More, more, more is rarely the mantra of a successful person.

Might as well panic,"If you don't know what to do, and you're frightened, might as well panic.
That seems to be the first rule of being a member of the human race. Apparently, panicking is an acceptable substitute for forethought, contingency planning or actually taking productive action. We almost want to blame the thing we're anxious about on the person who isn't panicking. ""Don't you care! Can't you see that we're all gonna die! That we're going to go bankrupt? That the world as we know it is going to end?""
More people are killed by deer than sharks, but you don't see park rangers running around like nutcases.
There's huge pressure on our leaders and co-workers and institutions to panic. If for no other reason, we say, they should panic as a sign that they care, that they are taking things seriously.

The collectible totem,"I've been a huge fan of Hugh MacLeod since he first showed up on the web a few years ago. Hugh is a provocateur, a brilliant marketer and a nice guy. He's also a great cartoonist.
Hugh's images, combined with his insightful promiscuous licensing policy (want to use this cartoon? Sure!) propelled his blog to the top of the charts and led to a book deal.
His newest project, though, is the point of this post.
Hugh is makingfine art printsof his cartoons, in very limited editions. It's basically a collectible (like Andy Warhol silkscreens or Swatch watches) but for businesses. But it's more than that, because you can hang it on the wall. By putting something up for all to see, you start conversations or remind people of the mission.
So far, it's working. I'm told that every other poster in the series has sold out its pre-sale allocation, and my guess is that while resales will be rare, they'll go up in value.
Totem poles have been around for a long time, because they work. We need a place to tell our stories, and a reminder of what to talk about. I think it's really cool to start a conversation with something that hangs on the wall. Years ago, I visited the offices of DC Comics and noticed some plaster on the wall of the conference room. That's when I noticed a hand (Superman's hand) punching through the dry wall. It changed the conversations that got held in that room. Most products (or even services) could turn into totem poles if you worked at it. I'm sort of amazed at how little this idea has been leveraged.
Hugh's latest print made me blush. He asked me for permission to do the cover of Purple Cow, a book he found inspirational. I agreed to let him take a shot, and here it is. The book exists for people to talk about it, so this is perfect. I told Hugh that my readers needed hear about it first, but Hugh's posting his take on it in a few minutes.
Every penny of my share of the project goes to roomtoread.org. My hope is that this project alone will pay for most of a school in a small village that really needs one. If you're looking for a big purple totem pole, here you go. It's up to you whether to hang it in the portrait or landscape view. Thanks Hugh!

Making commercials for the web,"TV advertisers are finally discovering that YouTube + viral imagination = free media.
The good news for you is that money is not a barrier, which means that marketers of any size can play. But the rules are different, as they always are online.Because media is free but attention is not(this is flipped from TV world) you need to make a different sort of ad for a different sort of audience.
1. Assume that the viewer has the attention span of an espresso-crazed fruitfly. That means slapstick, quick cuts and velocity.
2. Find a word or phrase that you can own in Google, that fits in an email, and that comes up in discussion at the cafeteria table or in the playground.
Castrol gets both rules right in this inanecommercial.
3. Length doesn't matter. 10 seconds is fine and so is five minutes. Media is free, remember?
4. Challenge the status quo, be provocative, touch a social nerve or create some other sort of interesting conversation. In other words, a commercial worth watching.
Dove does both in this now-famouscommercial.
Because of the power of free media, I expect to see a whole host of commercials that would never be deemed effective enough to spend big media money on, but that generate huge views online. Look for plenty of irrelevant slogans and catch phrases and off strategy content… anything for an eyeball.
Also, understand that this is out of your control. Once launched, what happens, happens. One commercial I know of caught fire and ended up with millions of views. The client then called the producer, screaming in anger. He wanted to be able to turn it off, to decide how it got used, who talked about it, etc. You can't. Once it spreads, it belongs to the community, not to you.
The biggest shift is going to be that organizations that could never have afforded a national campaign will suddenly have one. The same way that there's very little correlation between popular websites and big companies, we'll see that the most popular commercials get done by little shops that have nothing to lose.","April 27, 2009","web commercials, viral marketing, online advertising"

Pick anything–the calculus of change,"Remember WordPerfect? This word processor dominated the world until Word wiped them out. How did that happen?
WordPerfect was the default word processor in every law firm, big company and organization in the land. If you had the DOS operating system, it was likely you were using WordPerfect. And, if the operating system in the office hadn't changed to Windows, it's likely you'd still be using it now.
What happened was that the change in operating system created a moment when people had to pick. They had to either switch to Word or wait for a new version of WordPerfect. In that moment, ""do nothing"" was not an option.
Do nothingis the choice of people who are afraid. Do nothing is what you do if too many people have to agree. Do nothing is what happens if one person with no upside has to accept downside responsibility for a change. What's in it for them to do anything? So they do nothing.
The key moment for an insurgent, then, is the time of ""pick anything."" That's why these are such good times for iPhone apps. That's why the beginning of an administration is a good time to lobby. When peoplehaveto pick, they have to confront some of the fear and organizational barriers that lead to the status quo.
It seems to me, then, that the best time for a marketer to grow is when clients have to pick something. Seeking these moments out is inexpensive and productive.

Whether or which,"Most marketers are busy trying to persuade people to buy their product. Confusion sets in, though, when you compare a pitch designed to get someone to buyanyproduct in the category (you need an mp3 player because you can listen to music) vs. buying your product instead of the competition (ours is cheaper and bigger and better).
Are you trying to make the market bigger, or just grow your share?
When competing against a market dominator, your marketing generates more bang for the buck when you try tostealpeople who have already been persuaded to enter the category by the other guy. This is theNewtonrunning shoe story. Nike sells fitness, running, camaraderie, effort, glory. Newton sells ""buy us instead of Nike.""
It doesn't pay for an insurgent energy drink to sell ""thirst"" because much of that marketing will just get people to go buy the brands they've always bought. The opportunity instead is to provide leverage at the last possible moment in the buying cycle.
Getting new people to enter your market is hugely expensive. There's no way I can persuade a non-book buyer to start buying books–I don't have enough time or enough money.
This thinking rarely grows the market, though, so it falls on the market leader to figure out how to market well enough to get people into the category itself.

Sixty to zero,"Ever notice that most car specs focus on acceleration, not braking? It's more fun to focus on getting fast than it is on getting slow.

"Blogs, books and the irony of short","Blogs have eliminated the reason for most business books to exist. If you can say it in three blog posts and reach more people, then waiting a year and putting in all that effort seems sort of pointless. The chances that your effort will be rewarded with income in proportion to the time you put in are pretty low.
This has raised the bar for what it takes to write a decent business book. I really enjoyedThe Peter Principleyears ago, but I think we can all agree that today it would be better as a blog.
The best non-fiction books today either deliver a complex message that takes more space and attention than a short series of blog posts can deliver, or they are convenient packages to spread an idea from person to person in a more powerful way than an emailed link can. Books can take their time and build an argument, while blog posts are constantly fighting the reader's ability and desire to click away.
The irony?The market demands that you summarize your book in a blog post.
We're hesitant to buy a book (which is a far better value than just about any form of media) if we don't think we're going to like it. I guess that's built in from childhood, cause you get in trouble if you don't finish a book, and who wants to finish a book they don't like?
At least once a week, someone emails me a lousy review someone did of asummaryof one of my books. Not the book, but what they thought the book was about based on a blog post summary of the book.
Critics and shoppers are doing the same thing about your spa, mp3 player and insurance company. We now review the blog post version of it, not the actual experience. ""I heard the service at this restaurant was lousy."" How's that for condensing four years of hard work and training into a sentence?
And then we complain when the long version doesn't pack enoughpunch, seems too short and isn't transcendent enough for those thatpersevere.
This is irony (we say we want long and deep and rich but we also insist that it be condensed to a sentence) so it's not clear what you should do about it as a marketer, other than to accept that it's going on.","April 17, 2009","blogs, business books, irony"

Imminent,"The one thing that will allow your business to get funded, or to get a business to business buyer to buy from you or a college to admit you is the sense that your success is imminent.
If it's a foregone conclusion that you're going to break out, that all systems are go, then only an idiot wouldn't jump on board.
So, the real question is: what signals indicate that your success is imminent?
The brilliant venture capitalists are the guys who invest their money months or years before everyone else realizes how imminent the success is. They have better radar than the rest of us. Your job as a marketer or entrepreneur is to amplify the signals that buyers and investors look for. Spend your money on the right stuff, ignore the rest. If you try to market and spend on every element of your story, you'll be merely average. If, on the other hand, you can focus on which signals represent an imminent success, the leverage kicks in.
Simple old-school example: In 1984, I drove across the country from California to Boston to take a summer job at Spinnaker Software. As I drove through Chicago I passed a billboard for the company. Incredible! This little startup already had billboards across the entire country.
A few months later I found out that they had exactly one billboard, located between the airport and the convention center, put up just in time for the Consumer Electronics Show. For the buyers flying in from Minnesota or Texas, this was was one more clue that the company was about to hit it big.","April 14, 2009","Success, Imminent, Marketing"
How to make money with SEO,"There are two ways to use SEO to help your organization. One is reliable and effective, the other is a glorious crap shoot that usually fails but is wonderful when it works. I'll start with the second.
The most common way to use search engine optimization is to find a keyword (like ""plumbing"") and do whatever you can to 'own' that word on Google. This is Google as the Yellow Pages (with free ads).
The Yellow Pages are terrific for plumbers, because if you need a plumber, that's where you're going to look. Buy the biggest ad, be the first listing, you get calls. Google is a revelation because it's a super Yellow Pages and it's free! The problem: how to be the first listing, because being the 40th listing is fairly worthless.
The answer: You probably won't be. There are 14 million matches for Plumber, and no, you won't be #1 or #2. You lost. In fact, in just about every keyword worth owning, your chances are winning are small.
(To the .00001% of the people reading this who win–congratulations. You can ignore this post.)
This method is so appealing because it's all about converting the non-converted. For free, you show up in front of people who didn't know about you and you get your shot to convert them. This is the marketer's dream.
Am I saying it's not worth trying to win? Of course not. If you can give it a shot for the right set of keywords and not spend too much or count too much on winning, then go for it. But the other method is a lot more compelling (and, yes, you can do both at the same time).
The other way to use SEO is a bit more organic. (Let's call it the White Pages approach). It involves owning a keyword that youalreadyown. Do a search on ShoeMoney in Google and you'll find 340,000 matches. Wanna guess who's first?ShoeMoney. Why is this surprising? After all, he invented the word and he owns the domain.
Someone hears about Jeremy's site from a friend or from a blog or from some other source. They want to visit his site and they type it into Google. He told me that he gets five times as much traffic from this search term as any other on Google.
The power of this technique is that with determination and patience, you will certainly win. It requires inventing a trademark and then building a business or service or organization around this trademark that people actually talk about. You want to be able to say to someone, ""just type ____ into Google.""
Obviously, the only people who will do this have heard about you in some other way. So this is an amplification and word of mouth strategy, not a blue sky conversion play.
Here's the math:If you are lucky enough to 'win' at traditional Yellow Pages SEO, you might convert a few percentage points of the traffic you get into customers. On the other hand, if you win at White Pages SEO, if you win because people talk about your unique take and use your name, you convert just about everyone. Think about that… if someone types Seth into Google, they're probably looking for me, and so when they arrive here, they stay, because they found me. If, on the other hand, they type in Cow, most of the people who end up here aren't looking for my book, so they leave.
David Meerman Scott owns the word 'Meerman'. I have no idea if he uses his middle name in real life, but it sure helps him online. Scott Ginsberg owns the term 'nametag scott'. You get the idea. It's like owning the perfect domain, via Google.
When you start to win at the White Pages strategy, it turns out that this helps you win at both. Your blog or site gets more organic traffic, which will organically raise your Google results for other words and phrases.
Step by step:
1. Make an incredible product, offer a remarkable service.
2. Associate a unique term or trademark with it. (Something that isn't generic, and preferably, not a crowded search term already).
3. Assuming that you do #1 and #2, you'll end up owning that word in the search engines. If you don't, revisit the first two steps.

Opening acts and rock stars,"The opening act has the toughest gig in town. The audience isn't here to listen to you. They're restless. Perhaps you'll get a few seconds to earn their attention, but not much. Your gimmicks will fall flat and you might even get booed off stage.
The rock star, on the other hand, has the crowd chanting for him before he shows up. He starts a song and people applaud. They sing along. They finish his lyrics for him.
Most marketers are opening acts. The ad or blog post or tweet is a desperate attempt at attention, at keeping people from switching it off or booing. The posture of the marketer who is an opening act is unstable and a little sad.
Some marketers are rock stars.
How'd that happen?
I'd argue that the two keys to becoming a rock star marketer are:1. settle for a tiny audience that views you as a star, not an opening act. Then grow that audience.and2. Be really good.
I just went to seeKeller Williamsin concert. Without a doubt, he's a genius and a rock star. If he tried to pull this stuff as an opening act for someone else, he'd be booed off the stage.

Intentionally building communities (More hallway!),"If you think about the tribes you belong to, most of them are side effects of experiences you had doing something slightly unrelated. We have friends from that summer we worked together on the fishing boat, or a network of people from college or sunday school. There's also that circle of people we connected with on a killer project at work a few years go.
These tribes of people are arguably a more valuable creation than the fish that were caught or the physics that were learned, right?
And yet, most of the time we don't see the obvious opportunity–if you intentionally create the connections, you'll get more of them, and better ones too. If the hallway conversations at a convention are worth more than the sessions, why not have more and better hallways?
What would happen if trade shows devoted half a day to 'projects'? Put multi-disciplinary teams of ten people together and give them three hours to create something of value. The esprit de corps created by a bunch of strangers under time pressure in a public competition would last for decades.The community is worth more than the project.
The challenge is to look at the rituals and events in your organization (freshman orientation or weekly status meetings or online forums) and figure out how amplify the real reason they exist even if it means abandoning some of the time-honored tasks you've embraced. Going around in a circle saying everyone's name doesn't build a tribe. But neither does sitting through a boring powerpoint.

The first question every web site designer must ask,"If a client comes to you for a web site, the first thing you need to know is:
""Do you want the people visiting this site to notice it?""
It's a subtle but essential question.
For artists, musicians and web 2.0 companies, the answer is probably yes. Yes we want people to see the interface or remark on our skills or cleverness.
For everyone else, it's no. The purpose of the site is to tell a story or to generate some sort of action. And if the user notices the site, not the story, you've lost.
Amazingly, this means that not only can't the site be too cutting edge, clever or slick, it also can't be too horrible, garish or amateurish.

Reinventing the conference call,"Sasha had an interesting post on hisblogabout how horrible the typical conference call is. I hate them. He had some good tips, but it's still horrible.
So, here's my idea:
Conference calls should be accompanied by an online chat room. (Here's myfavorite, it's easy and free for a month). Or trycalliflower.
When you put text chat in parallel with a voice conference call, magical things happen.
The first is that everyone participates. If you don't, it's noticeable and you won't be invited back.
Second, the voice part of the call acts as a narrative for the chat part, allowing people to highlight or respond to what's being said.
Most of all, it creates organized, trackable chaos, which was the reason for the meeting in the first place.

On becoming proactive,"Tom points us to aprovocative ideafor home builders. If you want to sell a new house, why not offer prospective buyers help in selling theiroldhouses? Send your idle crews to their house to paint it or do other important cosmetic fixes. Fill the old house with the furniture you use in your models, etc.
Take it a step further. If your home building service is totally slack, why not get to work upgrading and selling older homes or even foreclosed ones?
Consider what a solo entrepreneur could do using eBay: instead of waiting for people to hold garage sales, why not distribute flyers offering to run a virtual garage sale for anyone who will open their home to you? Go in with a digital camera, catalog and photograph the top 20 most valuable items in the house and sell them on eBay… and split the money. Your proactive effort overcomes the seller's inertia and you both profit.
There are huge opportunities for this in the business to business space as well. Most companies would welcome a post-tax-day accountant who offered (on spec) to review bills or expenses in exchange for half the money saved. If they had time, they'd do it themselves, but of course they don't.

What does better mean?,"Are zippers better?

Now, that's all I wear. Buttons are better.
How can buttons be better? They're archaic. They take a long time. They're difficult.
Except that I like the way they look. And since I like them better, they are better.
This is a hard lesson for marketers, particularly technical marketers, to learn. You don't get to decide what's better. I do.

Sugar-coated corporate speak,"There's a new class of internet companies that collect cookie data across websites and sell compiled personal data to advertisers. This means, for example, that Mazda can run banner ads on site X only to people who were looking at new cars on site Y.
In order for this to work, of course, the companies need to get site Y to secretly sell them huge bundles of personal surfing data. You can think that this is okay or not okay, that's not the point of my post.
Check out some of the languageBlueKaiuses on the page of their site addressed to consumers [I notice that the company has since changed the wording, which is certainly a good thing. Here's the original text]:
In return, you, the consumer, are rewarded with the 3C's: control, charity, and content…
Charity—It gets better! When marketers pay to access anonymous data from BlueKai, you will be rewarded with a credit to donate to the charity of your choice…
BlueKai's mission is to build the world's most comprehensive registry of online preferences that is dedicated to ensuring your anonymity and privacy.
Give me a break. Is this really BlueKai's mission? I doubt it. When marketers talk to consumers like this, it's no wonder consumers hate us and distrust us. Wouldn't it be refreshing if we just told consumers the truth? They could (but don't) say:
If you don't want the ads you see online to be relevant, if you don't want us to keep your cookie information on file, all you have to do is click here and we'll banish you from our database. No, you shouldn't have to opt out of us using your personal data to make money, but hey, that's life.
The direct marketing industry has a long, troubled history of sneaking around, assuming permission they don't have and making it difficult for people to opt out. This has been shown again and again to be foolish and short-sighted.

"First, ten","This, in two words, is the secret of the new marketing.
Find ten people. Ten people who trust you/respect you/need you/listen to you…
Those ten people need what you have to sell, or want it. And if they love it, you win. If they love it, they’ll each find you ten more people (or a hundred or a thousand or, perhaps, just three). Repeat.
If they don’t love it, you need a new product. Start over.
Your idea spreads. Your business grows. Not as fast as you want, but faster than you could ever imagine.
This approach changes the posture and timing of everything you do.
You can no longer market to the anonymous masses. They’re not anonymous and they’re not masses. You can only market to people who are willing participants. Like this group of ten.
The timing means that the idea of a ‘launch’ and press releases and the big unveiling is nuts. Instead, plan on the gradual build that turns into a tidal wave. Organize for it and spend money appropriately. The fact is, the curve of money spent (big hump, then it tails off) is precisely backwards to what you actually need.

Deeper or wider,"If you want to grow the size of your customer base, you need to confront the buffet dilemma.
Any decent buffet has foods that please 85% of the population. Meats, cheeses, potatoes… the typical fare.
Once your business hits a natural plateau, it’s tempting to invest in getting more people to come. And what most buffets do is double down. Now, they have bacon, plus they have beans with bacon and turkey-wrapped bacon. Now, instead of one chocolate cake, they have three.
This is essentially useless. You haven’t done anything to grow your audience. The base might be a little more pleased, but not enough to bring in any new business. And the disenfranchised (the vegans, the weight watchers, the healthy eaters, the kosher crowd) remain unmoved and uninterested. And one person like this out of a party of six is enough to keep all six  away.
So, there are two ways to go. Much deeper, or a bit wider.
Deeper would mean a bacon-focused buffet, a dozen bacon dishes, including chocolate-covered bacon. Deeper would mean a chocolate-obsessed dessert bar, ten cakes, fondue, everything.
Deepergets you people willing to drive across town to visit you. It’s remarkable. It’s not like every other buffet but a little bit bigger. It’s insanely over the top. People will bully their friends in order to get them to come.
The other choice iswider. Instead of adding a handful of dishes that mildly please the people you already have, why not add brown rice and tofu and vegetarian chili? Now you’ve opened the doors to that last 15%.
This thinking isn’t available only to buffet owners. It works for summer camps. Resorts. Conference centers. Spiritual institutions. It works for any business that seeks to attract customers that come in groups where people have different wants and needs.","May 31, 2009","customer growth, buffet dilemma, audience expansion"
The next Google,"Microsoft, home of the Zune, has just announced that they're going to launchBing, a rebranding and reformatting of their search engine. So far, they've earmarked $100 million just for the marketing.
Bing, of course, stands forBut It's Not Google.The problem, as faras I can tell, is that it is trying to be the next Google. And thechallenge for Microsoft is that there already is a next Google. It's called Google.
Google is not seen as broken by many people, and a hundred million dollars trying to persuade us that it is, is money poorly spent. In times of change, the rule is this:
Don't try to be the 'next'. Instead, try to be the other, the changer, the new.
If Microsoft adds a few features and they prove popular, how long precisely will it take Google to mirror or even leapfrog those features?
With $100 million, you could build (or even buy) something remarkable. Something that spread online without benefit of a lot of yelling and shouting. Something that changes the game in a fundamental way. The internet works best when you build a network, not when you buy a brand. In fact, I can't think of one successful online brand that was built with cash.

Challenging convention,"The smart guys atContrastcame by the office to talk about their thesis of abandoning conventions. It's the intent of changing what we expect when we use something. Obvious things like the design of a cell phone or subtle things like the design of a door knob. There are terrific benefits to successfully coming up with a solution that invents and leverages a new convention.
I'd argue that there are four things to keep in mind when deciding to challenge a convention. You should incur the costs and hassles of inventing a new way to do things when you can are prepared to deal with all four. The costs can be huge, because a new user convention can slow people down or turn them away. A new financing convention makes it harder to raise money. A new hiring convention causes some people to avoid you…
Simple example: as a bestselling author, you could upend the convention that books cost money by publishing the first popular book-length ebook. For free. The new convention will be noticed. People will talk about it. They'll share the ebook because, after all, it's free. You can leverage this new convention by gaining attention, new readers, speaking gigs, etc. But can you protect it? Of course not. Now, everyone can make a free ebook, because your act of breaking convention showed them how. But that's okay, because as an innovator, the process was worth it.
Compare this to Kai's Power Tools, which was a series of super powerful image editing software programs that came out a decade ago. The interface had all sorts of new conventions. The problem was the new conventions had nothing to do with editing images, didn't make the software work better, increased the learning curve and ultimately led to failure in the marketplace.",,"Conventions, Innovation, Design"
Is marketing an art or a science?,"It's both, and that's the problem.
Some marketers are scientists. They test and measure. They do the math. They understand the impact of that spend in that market at that time with that message. They can understand the analytics and find the truth.
This sort of marketing works when it works, but it usually doesn't. That's because we're dealing with humans, the wild card in the system.
The other marketers are artists. They inspire and challenge and connect. These marketers are starting from scratch, creating movements, telling jokes and surprising people. Scientists aren't good at that.
The problem is caused by two things:1. Outsiders are confused.Which are we? When we're artists sometimes and scientists other times, we often seem like charlatans, because we're associating scientific results with artistic endeavors.2. We're confused. If you don't know if you're doing a science project or an art project, you'll probably emphasize the wrong elements. If you go to school to study marketing and the blowhard professor acts like she's teaching you science, you'll waste a lot of time trying to apply taxonomy and hypotheses to something that is essentially a gut decision. And vice versa.
We need hats. The hat of the scientist and the hat of the artist. You can only wear one hat at a time, which is why I didn't suggest that we need gloves.

Saying ‘no’,"If you've got talent, people want more of you. They ask you for this or that or the other thing. They ask nicely. They will benefit from the insight you can give them.
The choice: You can dissipate your gift by making the people with the loudest requests temporarily happy, or you can change the world by saying 'no' often.
You can say no with respect, you can say no promptly and you can say no with a lead to someone who might say yes. But just saying yes because you can't bear the short-term pain of saying no is not going to help you do the work.
Saying no to loud people gives you the resources to say yes to important opportunities.","May 26, 2009","Saying no, boundaries, prioritization"
When the writer becomes the publisher,"Walt Whitman and Ben Franklin were both printers who became writers… one would imagine they did this because it was cheaper to write your own stuff than hiring someone, and having words to print and sell is good business if you’re a printer.
The joke as we know it was unknown before the Civil War (so says Bob Mankoff [Jason disagrees and points us to thisarticle]). Sure, there were funny stories, but not jokes with punchlines. We don't know who wrote the first joke, but by 1920, there were books ofthousands of jokes. What shifted? You could get paid for writing jokes. Magazines bought jokes, so jokes got written.
I did a ridiculous series ofvideotapestwenty years ago, videos that certainly wouldn't have been made if there hadn't been a market for them.
Today, of course, being a printer is no fun. Anyone can be a digital printer, publishing their words to the web. And so we have a mysterious flip, in which writers are becoming ‘printers’, not the other way around.
In a world in which just about everyone is a writer and just about every writer wouldn’t mind benefiting from their work, there’s a huge need for people who can help us publish profitably. Or, failing that, figuring out a way to get your own words published profitably. Some people will happily remain amateurs, but history shows us that the real explosion in content happens after people figure out how to make money.
Mark this down as another job for the new economy: someone who can collate, amplify and leverage the work of writers and turn it into cash. I don't believe that there's one solution, not this time. But I'm confident that around the edges and deep into niches, there's money being made.","May 25, 2009","writing, publishing, monetization"
On becoming a household name,"The guidance office at the high school has a big poster for Wellesley College hanging by the door. It's just a picture of a building, no features, no benefits, no text at all.
Kids apply to schools (a quarter of a million dollar investment) for crazy reasons. A big one: ""Well, I've heard of it.""
GonzagaUniversity features basketball players on their home page. No doubt a few people attend to play basketball, but my guess is that the school believes that the fame of their school will somehow get someone who doesn't play to attend.
It's completely irrational and it's also what your customers do every day.
Being a familiar name takes you miles closer to closing a sale. People like to buy from companies they've heard of.
It turns out that this is an overlooked benefit of banner ads. Banner ads are fairly worthless in terms of generating clickthroughs… you have to trick too much and manipulate too much to get clicks worth much of anything. But, if you build ads with no intent of clicks, no hope for clicks… then you can focus on ads that drill your name or picture or phrase into my head. 100 impressions and you're almost famous.

Nostalgia is a basic human emotion,"Kodak created a billion dollar industry by giving people a tool to feed their nostalgia. We don't take pictures because we want to know what we're seeing now… we already know that. We take pictures because it makes us feel good to know that years later, when nostalgia for that moment comes around, we'll be ready.
Marketers spend a lot of time on other emotions… joy, love, jealousy, insecurity, greed… but nostalgia gets overlooked. I think that's an opportunity.
Aside: when you're doing something important, like launching a big project, or a new company, or running some sort of campaign designed to change things, keep a scrapbook. Not a note book, a tool for writing down facts. A scrapbook. Include photos and quotes and clippings and events. Two reasons.

Eternal September,"Our story so far…
Back in the 1960s, TV shows took great pains to catch you up on what had happened so far.Batmanspent a minute or so recapping last week's story. So didThe Fugitive. The thought was that while most people had seen the show just seven days ago, what about the people who missed it?
Fifteen years ago, someone coined the term,Eternal September. Because each September sees an entire crop of freshman showing up at college, you need to assume that you have to start teaching protocols all over again. Once a year, it's a whole new audience, and they need to learn the ropes.
The Internet has been stuck in September ever since. Every day, new people show up at your blog, on Facebook, everywhere. Every day it's a whole new crop that need to figure out what RSS is and how to subscribe. Every day there are people who spam their address book because it feels like a fine thing to do, then learn their lesson and never do it again. There are new people who need to learn the proper etiquette for interacting on your site. Can you imagine if the real world worked this way? If people walking into your store had never been to a store before? If drivers on the highway had never driven on a highway before?
It's going to be a long time before the medium stabilizes enough for the newbies to catch up, so the only alternative is to accept that it's always September.",,"Eternal September, new users, Internet etiquette"
A clean sheet of paper,"The range and availability of freelance talent is greater than it has ever been before. World class designers, artists, illustrators, photographers, strategists, potters, copywriters, programmers–they're all one click away.
There are two ways to work with talent.
The first is to give someone as clean a sheet of paper as possible. ""We have these assets, we have this opportunity, here is our budget, go!"" That's a great way to build ahouseif you have a ton of money and brilliant architects.
The second is to give someone as strategic and defined a mission as possible. ""Here are three logos from companies in other industries, together with the statement we want to make, the size it needs to be, the formats we need to use it and our budget, go!"" If you do this, you're almost certain to get something you can use, and almost certain not to be blown away with surprise. Which is the entire point.
Confusing these two approaches is the #1 cause of client dissatisfaction when working with talent.
The strategic mission takes more preparation, more discipline and more difficult meetings internally. It involves thinking hard without knowing it when you see it. It's also the act of a mature individual, earning his salary.
The clean sheet of paper is amazing when it works, but involves so much waste, anxiety and pain that I have a hard time recommending it to most people. If you're going to do this, you have an obligation to use what you get, because your choice was hiring this person, not in judging the work you got when you didn't have the insight to give them clear direction in the first place.","May 20, 2009","freelance talent, collaboration, project management"
Bravado,"Decades ago, a guy came to me with a nutty business idea. He was filled with energy and enthusiasm. ""It'll cut through the market like a thresher through a wheat field,"" (actual quote). He practically shouted, ""like a hot knife through butter.""
This sort of energy is contagious, but without a plan, it may not be productive.
I still remember a guy who used to work with me who came to me with a grandiose plan for a book he wrote based on a TV show. He had two data points: zero, where he started, and one appearance on one talk show as a result of one pitch. Drawing a straight line between the two points, it quickly reached infinity. Of course, very few things (even online) reach infinity any time soon.
The problem with bravado is that it forces you to suspend reality when making your plan. Optimism is self-fulfilling, bravado can be toxic.","May 19, 2009","bravado, optimism, business planning"
“It doesn’t hurt to ask”,"Actually, it does hurt. It does hurt to ask the wrong way, to ask without preparation, to ask without permission. It hurts because you never get another chance to ask right.
If you run into Elton John at the diner and say, ""Hey Elton, will you sing at my daughter's wedding?"" it hurts any chance you have to get on Elton John's radar. You've just trained him to say no, you've taught him you're both selfish and unrealistic.
If a prospect walks into your dealership and you walk up and say, ""Please pay me $200,000 right now for this Porsche,"" you might close the sale. But I doubt it. More likely than not you've just pushed this prospect away, turned the sliver of permission you had into a wall of self-protection.
Every once in a while, of course, asking out of the blue pays off. So what? That is dwarfed by the extraordinary odds of failing. Instead, invest some time and earn the right to ask. Do your homework. Build connections. Make a reasonable request, something easy and mutually beneficial. Yes leads to yes which just maybe leads to the engagement you were actually seeking.","May 18, 2009","asking, preparation, connections"
Luxury vs. premium,"Luxury goods are needlessly expensive. By needlessly, I mean that the price is not related to performance. The price is related to scarcity, brand and storytelling. Luxury goods are organized waste. They say, ""I can afford to spend money without regard for intrinsic value.""
That doesn't mean they are senseless expenditures. Sending a signal is valuable if that signal is important to you.
Premium goods, on the other hand, are expensive variants of commodity goods. Pay more, get more. Figure skates made from kangaroo hide, for example, are premium. The spectators don't know what they're made out of, but some skaters believe they get better performance. They're happy to pay more because they believe they get more.
A $20,000 gown is not a premium product. It's not better made, it won't hold up longer, it's not waterproof or foldable. It's just artificially scarce. A custom-made suit, on the other hand, might be worth the money, especially if you're Wilt Chamberlain.

Trouble accessing gmail remotely,"Here's an unrelated tech tip:
If you access Gmail using a program on your computer (like Mail.app or Outlook) sometimes you'll get an alert telling you that Gmail has rejected your password.
It turns out that there's ahidden linkGoogle provides that lets you do a Captcha test to prove that you're a human. It doesn't change your password, it just resets the flag that Google was using to block remote access.

Betting on the wind,"No project, no brand, no company exists in a vacuum. You make bets about external forces when you build something.
If you want to cross the Atlantic by boat, you can build a sailboat. Your bet is that the wind will be right when it's time to sail. Or you can build a motorboat and deal with the noise and expense, but insulate yourself from the wind.
If you launch a $100 million magazine, you're making a bet that the advertising environment will support you a few years down the road. If you spend four years getting an advanced degree in computer engineering, you're making a bet that there will be plenty of high-paying jobs still waiting for you when you graduate.
If I had a hundred million dollars to invest in a business magazine, there's no way I'd invest a hundred million dollars in a business magazine. Why put all your chips on one medium, one source of revenue, one model?
The external factor is not disconnected from your bet. Itisyour bet, your decision. Damning the gods of fate because you made the wrong bet makes no sense.

Marketing intolerance,"Until 1967 (when I was seven) it was against the law for a white man to marry a black woman in Virginia.
Marketing is a complicated beast. It's not just advertising. It's stories that spread, it's editorial content, it even includes interactions and facial expressions. Marketing amplifies human nature. We had no trouble living with racist laws because that racism was confirmed by the media we consumed.
When someone stands up in front of a crowd at a political rally or in a church, they're marketing. And when a Hollywood filmmaker turns someone of a particular race or sexual preference into an object of ridicule or contempt, that's marketing too. Politicians market every time they speak up at a press conference.
When Michal Grzes, an elected representative in Poland stands up andcriticizesa zoo for housing a gay elephant, he's doing marketing as well. If you want a cheap laugh, all you need to do is make fun of the minority, treat them as lesser, or separate.
I'm surprised and delighted that online media is being used to market tolerance more than intolerance. But it's an uphill battle, and until we get to the point where homophobia and racism (even for laughs) is unheard of, we have a long way to go. Marketing is too powerful, imho, to be wasted diminishing someone's humanity. And no one ever got ahead (no one, ever) by limiting the equal rights of someone else.","May 14, 2009","Marketing, Racism, Tolerance"

Ignore sunk costs,"The most important decision-making rule you learn in business school is still largely misunderstood.
When making a choice between two options, only consider what’s going to happen in the future, not which investments you’ve made in the past. The past investments are over, lost, gone forever. They are irrelevant to the future.
You have two pieces of land. One you bought for $1,000,000, one for $10,000. On which one should you develop a gas station?
I know. The one that’s right next to the huge subdivision being put up, not the one next to the condemned shopping center. Does it matter how much the land cost to buy? No. Not at all.
You have tickets to the Springsteen concert. They were really hard to get. You spent four hours surfing StubHub until you found the perfect seats for $55 each.
On your way into the event, a guy offers you $500 cash for each ticket. Should you sell?
It turns out the amount of time you spent getting the tickets is irrelevant. If you wouldn’t be willing to PAY $500 for these tickets (and you weren’t, or you would have) then you should be willing to sell them for $500. Spend $250 on dinner and go buy better tickets for tomorrow night’s show.
Or say you make a mistake and go to the concert instead of selling (those seats are $500 seats now). But Bruce is sick and Manfred Mann is substituting for him. You don’t like him so much. But you paid $500 for the seats! Should you stay?
[Just because the guy spent a lot on the sign for his store doesn’t mean he shouldn’t spend more to spell the biggest word properly. The amount he already spent is irrelevant. What matters is what the benefit of spelling ‘stationery’ properly will be.]

What to do with people who aren’t going to go away quietly,"Stalling provides a hurdle that allows you to filter out requests.
If you put people on hold for six minutes, the trivial calls hang up. If you tell people that they can have something they've requested but will have to wait a long time, the unmotivated will go away. (I'm not proposing that this is a good way to handle customers, I'm merely saying that it does in fact triage the incoming requests.)
The question is, what do you do with the people who, from the start, are obviously not going to go away?
If a woman is in labor, you can try every demotivating tactic you can think of, she's still gonna have a baby. Might as well accept this and get her a room in the maternity ward, right now. Anything else is just annoying and a waste of time.
Don't try to talk a vegan into eating the chicken-fried steak just because the chef will yell at you if you ask for one more plate of steamed vegetables. It's not going to work, might as well skip the discussion and go get the veggies, with a smile.
It takes judgment to figure out who's not going to go away, but once you know, embrace the situation, don't struggle with it. It doesn't matter if it's not fair or not convenient.

Two halves of the value fraction,"In a down economy, marketers fret a lot about price. We think that since times are tough, people care about price and nothing but price.
Of course, people actually care more aboutvalue. They care about value more than they used to because they can’t afford to overpay, they don’t want to make a mistake with their money.
Value = benefit/price.That means that one way to make value go up is to lower price, right?
The thing is, there’s another way to make the value go up. Increase what you give. Increase quality and quantity and the unmeasurable pieces that bring confidence and joy to an interaction.
When all of your competitors are busy increasing value by cutting prices, you can actually increase market share by increasing value and raising benefits.","May 9, 2009","value, pricing, market share"
Too much free,"If you want to know who’s a newbie on a film set, just watch what happens at lunch. Major films have huge buffets laid out for cast and crew, and the newcomers can’t resist. It’s FREE! Over time, of course, the old-timers come to the conclusion that it's just lunch, and the crew gets a bit more jaded and learns some self-restraint as well.
The first time a previously expensive good or service is made free, we’re drawn to it precisely because of the freeness. The fifth time or tenth time, not so much.
Free online has two distinct elements, then. Breakthrough free, like the first free ebook or the first free email service, and sample-this free, which decreases the cost of trial and lowers boundaries of the spread of an idea.
But they shouldn’t be confused. As the market for free gets more crowded, we’ll see more and more people promoting their free products, stuff that people used to have pay for. A complete shift from ‘you will pay’ to 'it is free' to  ‘I will pay for ads to alert you it’s free' to ultimately, 'I will pay you to try it'.
Free by itself is no longer enough to guarantee much of anything.","May 8, 2009","free services, consumer behavior, market saturation"
Strangers and friends,"Most marketers are organized aroundmore. More share. More customers.
And if you want to do that fast, it means marketing to strangers. Strangers that don't care about you, don't trust you and aren't listening to you.
You market to a friend differently. A friend isn't necessarily someone you went to summer camp with, it's someone who gives you the benefit of the doubt. Someone who will listen, at least once, to your pitch.
I was talking to an author about his next project. The question I askedhim was, ""are you writing this for strangers or friends?"" Theimplications are huge. It impacts how you design the cover, how youprice it, what it's about, where you sell it, when you publish it, howmuch you pay for store displays, etc…
You need to treat friends differently at every step along the way. First, don't confuse the moments you're supporting them or connecting with them with the moments when you are doing business. Second, understand that the most powerful win is when your friends tell their friends about you. This is worth 1000 times more than you talking about yourself.
The cool thing is that now, everyone has ten times as many friends as they used to. The social graph online is a fascinating, exponential factor in growing the list of people who might be willing to hear what you have to say (once).
Which means that your site and offer and products can be organized around friend selling instead of stranger setting.
Guaranteed: if you sell a friend the way you sell a stranger, you've made neither a sale or a friend.","May 7, 2009","Marketing, Relationships, Friend Selling"
Ten years of Permission Marketing,"When I wrotePermission Marketing, people thought I was some sort of crackpot (some people still do, fortunately). One author wrote that I was ""delusional"" and skeptical marketers were sort of amazed that the idea caught on. The Direct Marketing Association viewed the very concept as a threat to their future.
The best ideas are like that. The book published on May 6, 1999, which feels like six lifetimes ago.
Ten years later, ethical email marketing is abilliondollar industry. Many companies have been built on the foundation of this simple idea, and some of them are quite profitable. Daily Candy sold to Comcast for more than $120 million and it is nothing but a permission marketing engine. More important, I think, the attitude of anticipated, personal and relevant messaging is changing the way organizations come to market.
Asearchon the term shows a bazillion matches, though I wish spammers would quit using the term to pretend that they are actually doing something worthwhile. It delights me to see my neologism enter the language, used by people who didn't even know that it came from a book that's only ten years old.
The biggest impact of Permission Marketing isn't that there is less spam. In fact, there's more, because it's so cheap. No, the biggest measurable impact is the growth of truly opt in marketing, from close to zero to a number big enough that we've all seen it and are part of it. Not just email lists, of course, but RSS feeds and yes, Google AdWords.
Some lessons about accidental success:
There's a lot of updating that the book could use, because when I wrote it there was no Google, Facebook, Twitter, universal email access, widespread high bandwidth connectivity, browsers that rarely crashed or iPhones. But I'm going to let it stand as is, because keeping it up to date is a never ending task. I hope the general concepts stand the test of time. The biggest thing I'd change is the emphasis on games and prizes over promises and connection and information. I think the latter end up scaling better and are more universal and reliable.
Short version: Don't be selfish. You're not in charge. Make promises and keep them. It's like dating. It's an asset, it's expensive and it's worth it.","May 6, 2009","Permission Marketing, ethical email marketing, opt-in marketing"
The Houdini technique,"Make easy things look difficult.
Make difficult things look easy.
Flying a plane from one city to another, on time, is incredibly difficult. There’s a million things that can go wrong. And yet, for years, the airlines worked hard to make it appear easy. They wanted to appear competent and to make us feel safe.
The other day, as I waited for a flight, I heard the dreaded announcement. The flight was delayed, there was a mechanical problem. Angst filled the gate area.
Five minutes later, they announced that the problem was fixed, and we could board… we ended up leaving ten minutes early. Joy throughout the land!
Where did the joy come from? It came from the rapid shift in expectations. For a moment, the airline made it look hard. then they did the trick and we were saved.
Houdini never said, “check out these trick handcuffs and watch how easy it is for me to take them off.""",,"Houdini technique, expectations, appearance of competence"
Thinking about business models,"A business model is the architecture of a business or project. It has four elements:
The internet 1.0 was a fascinating place because business models were in flux. Suddenly, it was possible to have costless transactions, which meant that doing something at a huge scale was very cheap. That means that #2 was really cheap, so #1 didn't have to be very big at all.
Some people got way out of hand and decided that costs were so low, they didn't have to worry about revenue at all. There are still some internet hotshot companies that are operating under this scenario, which means that it's fair to say that they don't actually have a business model.
The idea of connecting people, of building tribes, of the natural monopoly provided by online communities means that the internet is the best friend of people focusing on the third element, insulation from competition. Once you build a network, it's extremely difficult for someone else to disrupt it.
As the internet has spread into all aspects of our culture, it is affecting business models offline as well. Your t-shirt shop or consulting firm or political campaign has a different business model than it did ten years ago, largely because viral marketing and the growth of cash-free marketing means that you can spread an idea farther and faster than ever before. It also makes it far cheaper for a competitor to enter the market (#3) putting existing players under significant pressure from newcomers.

Friction saves the medium,"Email is dying because it's free. If you can send an email for free to 100 of your closest friends, instantly, you probably won't abuse the privilege. But someone else will because they might define 'friend' differently than you or I.
100 times 100 is ten thousand. Spam.
So now, people don't reply when you send them a resume, because it costs too much to do that ten thousand times.
Twitter is next. The paradox is obvious: to grow, you need to remove friction from the medium. If it's not easy and free to use, people won't. But then it gets big and it becomes profitable, so people use it too much.
Thechurn rateat twitter is reported as more than 50%. That's because of lack of friction as well. Easy to get in, easy to get out.

Well, I know the folks at the local library and asked who she was working with. She told me the head of the library's name (!) and I said I'd check with her and call back. The telemarketer insisted on giving me her full name and number so that after I checked, I could call her back and do business.
You've already guessed this: My library had never heard of these guys. But plenty of otherorganizationshave. I called the company for comment, was transferred to their parent company and they refused to comment.
I'm just astonished by this organization. Astonished that the telemarketer would be willing to do this all day–defrauding small businesses in the name of a local charity or institution. Astonished that a company in the US can do this for years and years without someone shutting them down. Most of all, amazed at how trivial the whole thing is. Drip, drip, drip it apparently ends up with enough money on the table for people to sacrifice their ethics.","May 2, 2009","telemarketing, fraud, ethics"
Mechanics vs. intent,"There are a thousand things you can do to improve the mechanics of people spreading the word about you, your conference, your product, your event, your service. You can create hashtags, provide kiosks, host discussions, give out free postcards or hand out bumper stickers. There are plenty of useful tactics available to you.
Mechanics are important, no doubt.
More important by far is creating a desire to share. If people intend to share, they'll find a way, the mechanics are just a convenience. But if you don't go the extra mile and I end up not caring, all the tactics in the world won't help.","May 1, 2009","mechanics, intent, sharing"
Malcolm is wrong,"I've never written those three words before, but he'snever disagreedwith Chris Anderson before, so there you go.
Freeis the name of Chris's new book, and it's going to be wildly misunderstood and widely argued about.
The first argument that makes no sense is, ""should we want free to be the future?""
Who cares if we want it? It is.
The second argument that makes no sense is, ""how will this new business model support the world as we know it today?""
Who cares if it does? It is. It's happening. The world will change around it, because the world has no choice. I'm sorry if that's inconvenient, but it's true.
As I see 'free', there are two forces at work:
In an attention economy (like this one), marketers struggle for attention and if you don't have it, you lose. Free is a relatively cheap way to get attention (both at the start and then through viral techniques).
Second, in a digital economy with lots of players and lower barriers to entry, it's quite natural that the price will be lowered until it meets the incremental cost of making one more unit. If a brand can gain share by charging less, a rational player will.
Conde Nast (publisher of theWired(Chris's magazine) and yes, theNew Yorker(Malcolm's magazine)),  is going to go out of business long before you get sick, never mind die. So will newspapers printed on paper. They're going to disappear before you do. I'm not wishing for this to happen, but by refusing to build new digital assets that matter, traditional publishers are forfeiting their future.
Magazines and newspapers were perfect businesses for a moment of time, but they wouldn't have worked in 1784, and they're not going to work very soon in the future either.
We're always going to need writers, but the business model of their platform is going to change.
People will pay for contentifit is so unique they can't get it anywhere else, so fast they benefit from getting it before anyone else, or so related to their tribe that paying for it brings them closer to other people. We'll always be willing to pay for souvenirs of news, as well, things to go on a shelf or badges of honor to share.
People will not pay for by-the-book rewrites of news that belongs to all of us. People will not pay for yesterday's news, driven to our house, delivered a day late, static, without connection or comments or relevance. Why should we? A good book review on Amazon is more reliable and easier to find than a paid-for professional review that used to run in your local newspaper, isn't it?
Like all dying industries, the old perfect businesses will whine, criticize, demonize and most of all, lobby for relief. It won't work. The big reason is simple:
In a world of free, everyone can play.
This is huge. When there are thousands of people writing about something, many will be willing to do it for free (like poets) and some of them might even be really good (like some poets). There is no poetry shortage.
The reason that we needed paid contributors before was that there was only economic room for a few magazines, a few TV channels, a few pottery stores, a few of everything. In world where there is room for anyone to present their work, anyone will present their work. Editors become ever more powerful and valued, while the need for attention grows so acute that free may even be considered expensive.
Of course, it's ironic that sometimes people pay money for my books (I view them as souvenirs of content you could get less conveniently and less organized for free online if you chose to). And it's ironic that I read Malcolm's review for free. And ironic that you can read Chris's arguments the most cogently by paying for them. [Update:you can chime in hereand see what's being said around the web as well.]
Neatness is for historians.For a long time, all the markets for attention-based goods are going to be messy, which means that there are going to be huge opportunities for people (like you?) able to get that most precisous asset (our attention) for free. At least for a while.","June 30, 2009","Free, Attention Economy, Business Model"
There’s always room for Jello,"This is one of the great cultural touchstone slogans of our era. A culture where there's so much to eat we need to try to find a food that we can eat even if we're stuffed.
Often, we'll decide that something is full, stuffed, untouchable but then some Jello shows up, and suddenly there's room.
Think about your schedule… is there room for an emergency, an SEC investigation, a server crash? If you took a day off because of the flu, is your business going to go bankrupt? Probably not.
So, if there's time for an emergency (Jello), why isn't there time for brilliance, generosity or learning?",,"Jello, flexibility, openness"
How to be a packager,"For fifteen years, I was a book packager. It has nothing to do with packaging and a bit more to do with books, but it's a great gig and there are useful lessons, because there are dozens of industries just waiting for you to do something like this. Let me explain:
A book packager is like a movie producer, but for books. You invent an idea, find the content and the authors, find the publisher and manage the process. Book packagers make almanacs, illustrated books, series books for kids and the goofy one-off books you find at the cash register. I did everything from a line of almanacs to a book on spot and stain removal. It was terrific fun, and in a good year, a fine business. Along the way, I worked with just about every major publisher and created more than a hundred books. I packaged (with various levels of success) video games, college professors, Julia Robert's astrologer, an award-winning children's novelist, the Weekly World News, Kinko's and (almost) Craftsmen Tools.
I think there are real advantages to this model (and not just for books). Star Wars toys, for example, were created by a packager, and so are most big budget movies. Duncan Hines licensed his name to Roy Park, perhaps the most successful food packager of all time. Roy died of old age with more than half a billion dollars to his name thanks to all that cake mix.
First, the world needs packagers. Packagers that can find isolated assets and connect them in a way that creates value, at the same time that they put in the effort to actually ship the product out of the door.  Kaplan might never have gotten into the test prep book business if we hadn't done all the hard work of persuading them to enter the market (it took several years) and creating the books that launched their line. One series of books generated tens of thousands of new customers for them.
Second, in many industries there are 'publishers' who need more products to sell. Any website with a lot of traffic and a shopping cart can benefit from someone who can assemble products that they can profitably sell. Apple uses the iPhone store to publish apps. It's not a perfect analogy, because they're not taking any financial risk, but the web is now creating a new sort of middleman who can cheaply sell a product to the end user. We also see this with Bed, Bath and Beyond commissioning products for their stores, or Trader Joe's doing it with food items.
Any time you can successfully bring together people who have a reputation or skill with people who sell things, you're creating value. If you find an appropriate scale, it can become a sustainable, profitable business.
The skills you bring to the table are vision, taste and a knack for seeing what's missing. You also have to be a project manager, a salesperson and the voice of reason, the person who brings the entire thing together and to market without it falling apart. Like so many of the businesses that are working now, it doesn't take much cash, it merely takes persistence and drive.
Here are some basic rules of thumb that I learned the hard way:","June 29, 2009","packaging, book packager, project management"
The paradox of the middle of the market,"The middle of the market is the juicy part, where profit meets scale.
The paradox is that it's almost impossible to make a product or service for this segment, because they want the tried, the true and the boring.
A friend writes a blog and books for this market. They need his writing. He delivers a lot of value. And yet, it's going to take years (if ever) before he reaches them. That's because this market doesn't seek out new ideas, doesn't leave comments on blogs, doesn't spend a lot of time urging others to check out this new thing. He's spending all his focus on this market, and they're not repaying his focus with their attention.
The middle of the market is the home of Sinatra, Diamond, and Streisand. There's an endless list of others that would like to break in, but it rarely happens. The leading edge of the market is a lot smaller, but far easier to cater to, because those folks are looking and listening and talking. The middle will catch up, eventually, but that doesn't mean you have to bet on them.
In mypostyesterday, I talked about the temptation to merely pander to the geeks. It's not that difficult to write a blog, for example, that repeatedly shows up on Digg or Reddit. The thing is, this audience is fickle and they don't often convert into paying customers or long-term fans. It's not that difficult to be haute couture, to be fashionable, cutting edge or fickle. What's difficult is figuring out how to make it pay.
I'm not talking about compromising or dumbing down your product. A very hot hot sauce is remarkable. A sort of hot one is boring, and no one, not even the geeks will talk about it. I'm talking about designing products that are simultaneously remarkableandpalatable to people in the middle of the market.
The middle of the market is a paradox because of the inherent contradiction between the ease of reaching the nerds and the geeks and the need to reach the middle. The solution, if there is one, is to enter a market to the enthusiastic cheers of those in search of the new, but to build a product/service that appeals to those in the middle. After the initial wave of enthusiasm, you hunker down and ignore those that first embraced you, obsessing instead on the needs and networks of the middle. It's a difficult balancing act, but it's the only one that works.
Ultimately, you end up disappointing the hard core that first found you, but because of their initial enthusiasm (and more important, because you designed your work for the masses in the first place), your productcrossesthe chasm and reaches a larger group. The formula starts with a service or product that's purple enough to spread, but not so hyper-fashionable that it merely entertains the insiders.","June 28, 2009","Middle market, Paradox, Product development"
"Fast in, fast out","Mark points us tothis studyof fads and trends.
It turns out that a fast-growing trend is also likely to become a fast-fading trend. My analysis: the people who jump on a fast-moving trend are fickle early adopters. This group is most likely to race on to the next thing, and is also least likely to want to sign up for something that feels tired.
Another way to look at it: if you want to stick around for a while, you need to make the difficult sales to the middle of the marketorhave a ready supply of new stuff ready to entertain the never-satisfied early adopters.
That sounds pretty obvious as I write it, but I wonder why marketers everywhere ignore it? We say we're eager to build a brand for the ages, but we spend all our time and money launching it to the early adopters instead of patiently earning the trust of the middle.","June 27, 2009","trends, early adopters, brand building"
Can summer camp change your life?,"I think it can. It did for me.
I went to thebest summer camp in the world(the pictures to the right are by the now-famous but then teenagedJill Greenberg). Most of what I know, I learned there.
This summer, you could send your kids to avideo editing campwhere they would learn a skill for life. Or you could find abarcampor even be invited to afoocamp. It would make a change if you wanted it to.
Why?
It's voluntary. It's intentional (you go for a change). You become part of a tribe of fellow travelers, other people in a hurry to go where you're going to. Conferences aren't like this, and neither are meetings. School, at its best can achieve this, but it's rare.

The difference between strangers and friends,"Strangers are justifiably suspicious.
Friends give you the benefit of the doubt.
“Friend” is more broadly defined as someone you have a beer with or meet up with to go on a hike. A friend is someone who has interacted with you, or who knows your parents or reads your blog—someone with history. If you’ve made a promise to someone and then kept it, you’re a friend. If you’ve changed someone for the better, you’re a friend as well.
We market to friends very differently than we market to strangers. We do business differently as well.
Thanks to social networks and the amplification of stories online, we have far more friends per person than at any other time in human history. Nurturing your friends—protecting them and watching out for them—is an obligation, and it builds an asset at the same time.
(I want to distinguish friends from 'friendlies', the people you have a digital link to, but no real connection. Friendlies are basically strangers with a thumbnail of their face on your screen. They're not friends. And, while we're at it, the moment you treat a friend like a stranger (form mail, for example) they're not a friend any more, are they?)",,"friends, strangers, relationships"
Priming the pump of efficiency,"There's always a gap between the short-term results of a well-polished system and the first results of a switch to a more efficient one.
If you stick with that thing you've worked so hard to perfect, the next few hours or weeks or months will surely outperform the results you'll get from the new thing. That's because there are switching costs, glitches and a learning curve.
When you rearrange the shop floor, switch to email, convert your interactions to a new platform or make a building more energy efficient, this always happens. That means if you have a short-term perspective, you're never going to switch.
Switching your ad campaign to digital? You'll take a hit. Better stick to what you know.
Switching from a central city cube farm to a distributed at-home workforce? That will cost you big time next quarter. Probably not worth it.
Switching from a phone reservations system to Open Table? No way it will pay off this month.
The end result is that organizations that choose to switch are usually the ones with the least to lose. The upstarts and the outliers. One reason they're always leapfrogging the market leaders.
One way to stay innovative is to understand that this gap exists and to budget for it. Denying it won't make it go away.","June 25, 2009","efficiency, switching costs, innovation"
"Magicians, sausage makers and transparency","Does everything have to become completely transparent?
One of the ideas du jour online is the rush to make things transparent. To tear down the barriers and raise the blinds on the way organizations do business and to expose as much as possible.
Does Apple become a more exciting or profitable company if they share their sketches, their plans, open source their new designs and engage the company fully? Does Steve Jobs have an obligation to tell his fanboys in advance that he’s fighting to stay healthy? One journalist says he does because it will help raise money for research, another says he does because it’s a public company, while many of his fans say he does because they demand to know.
What about the Star Trek sequel? Should we be able to read the script now, a year before they start filming?
Does a magician put on a better show if you know how his tricks are done? Do you want to see how your dinner was made, farm to plate? Really?
I look at the transparency issue not as a moral right, but as a business tactic, tool and threat.
1. If you run around acting like the things you do will never been seen in public, you’re going to get busted. Sooner or later, the marketplace is going to see the effects of your actions, and living as if this is certain makes it far more likely that you’ll find a happy ending.
2. Your job as a marketer is to tell a story, which is a lot like putting on a show. If you can use the tools of transparency to tell that story better, do it! But if your audience will enjoy the story more (and your business will be more likely to succeed) if you apply some misdirection and magic, then why not?
Radical transparency often excites people because of the radical part (it’s new! it’s scary!) than the transparent part. Playing poker with your cards face up on the table might get you some attention at first, but in the long run it’s unlikely to help you win a lot of hands.","June 24, 2009","transparency, marketing, business strategy"
Find your voice,"Marketing (in all its forms) is unlike everything else an organization does, because it's always different. There's no manual because everyone does it differently, and what successful marketers have in common is that they are successful.
The only way your organization is going to make an impact is to market in the way only you can. Not by following some expert's rules or following the herd, but by doing it in the way that works. For you. Don't worry about someone else's invented standards for new media, invent your own. Avoid obvious mistakes, don't follow obvious successes.
Find your voice, don't copy someone else's.",,"Voice, Marketing, Authenticity"
Learning from Singer,"At one point, the Singer Corporation had more than 12,000 people working in a single plant. They were selling more than a million sewing machines a year and had hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. By any measure, it was one of the most important manufacturers in America. It was fun while it lasted.
Back then, it was easy to believe that Singer represented everything that was right with our economy, and that our future was intrinsically attached to the company's.
When as the last time you even thought about Singer (or a sewing machine for that matter)?
The cycles are far shorter now than they were during the century that Singer was a shining light for corporate success. More now than ever, success today is no guarantee of success tomorrow.
Sometimes we spend more time than we should defending the old thing, instead of working to take advantage of the new thing. I bet you can list a dozen ""critical"" industries that will be as relevant to life in 2020 as Singer is to our world today.
The key difference is that back then, managers and shareholders could stall and fumble and wait out the transition until after they retired. Now, it's almost an annual event. Hiding isn't working, and neither is whining. The best marketing strategy is to destroy your industry before your competition does.","June 23, 2009","Singer Corporation, corporate success, industry transition"
Circling the big domino,"Clay taught me a good lesson about making things happen with your brand.
Envision the events that might happen to a brand (shelf space at Walmart, an appearance on Oprah, a bestseller, worldwide recognition, a new edition, worldwide rights, chosen by the Queen, whatever) as a series of dominos.
It turns out that if you start with all of them at once, you'll fail.
And if you start with the big one, you'll fail.
But if you line up all the dominos one by one, in the right order, you may just have enough energy to push over the first one. That one, of course, adds momentum so that when you crash into the second one, that one goes too. All the way to the Queen.
Wait!
Isn't this obvious? Sure it is. So why is it so often ignored?
Brands get stuck constantly. And they always get stuck circling the big domino. They try to launch worldwide and beat Google. They try to get an endorsement from the Prince of Denmark. They try to break out with a feature on a major blog. They try to act like Coca Cola from the first day. And they try and they try and they try until they get so frustrated, they quit.
A few brands pick out tiny dominos instead. And topple them. And they do it again. They do it so often they create noise, momentum and most important, a sense of inevitability. That's how you win.","June 22, 2009","branding, momentum, strategy"

Two ways to build trust,"You can be a trusted institution or a trusted individual.
A few weeks ago, I set out to buy some imprinted items. I probably looked at a dozen t-shirt options online before I pickedCustomInk. Why did I pick them?
They weren't the cheapest (but it's actually very hard to compare). I picked them because the site is clean and professional. I liked that they're not weasels (they quote actual prices and actual ship dates) and  they have non-trivial, easy to use software that makes it easy to upload graphics and build a shirt.
Taken together, they earned my trust. There were plenty of sites with lousy typefaces and come-on pricing and bait and switch and clever Google ads, but none of this works on me. What works is someone walking the walk while they talk a good game.
Interestingly, I bought the hats from a totally different business.Roberts Specialtycouldn't be less formal or carefully built. It's clearly a family run business, and their lack of spin and hustle hit exactly the right tone. When you want to order, you send an email to Tony Bennett (you gotta love the fact that his name is Tony Bennett) and he sends an email back. How old fashioned. How trustworthy.
One reason that so many hard sell businesses fail is that they are neither. They aren't (or don't appear to be) trustworthy institutions, nor are they trustworthy humans. So we move on. You do 95% of it right, then use cheesy fonts or lie a bit or try too hard and boom, that's it.",,"trust, credibility, customer experience"
Circles of Convenience,"Allan points out that Warren Buffet and Benjamin Graham invested inCircles of Competence. The idea is to buy what you know.
Too often, organizations confuse this with circles of convenience. They stick to the tactics, products, people and channels that they are comfortable with, instead of rethinking what the market demands.
When Amazon offered the New York Times millions of dollars in affiliate revenue a decade ago, the paperturned them downbecause they feared losing Barnes and Noble as an advertiser. This is a convenient decision, but clearly not a smart one.
When companies look to hire new talent, they often go where they've gone before, because it's convenient. When newly minted MBAs go job hunting, they often go to the placement office because it's convenient as well.
Convenience is hugely attractive in organizations because it is easy to defend and easy to approve. You don't need to call a meeting to try something new, because the convenient option has already been approved. The problem is that convenient approaches rarely break through or generate extraordinary returns.","June 18, 2009","Circles of Competence, Convenience, Organizational Decision-Making"
Scalejacking,"Dave Balter coined this great term. It describes the quest of marketers for size at all costs. Because marketers were raised on the scale of mass—TV, radio, newspapers—they have a churn and burn mentality. The internet turns this upside down. The internet is about who, not how many. The internet lets you take really good care of 100 people instead of harassing 2,000.
Yet, panicked marketers still look for scale (How many followers can we get? What can we do with a Facebook fan page?) and then hijack that attention, hoping to filter out the masses and get a few sales.
Scalejacking inevitably tarnishes most communities, because individuals (people) hate being treated like numbers just standing by to be filtered.
Stephen Stills wrote, ""If you can't be with the one you love, love the one you're with."" I think he was wrong. On the Internet, the mantra that works is, ""Be with the ones you love (and the ones that love you.)"" Ignore everyone else.

Plan a rabbi's wedding and you probably shouldn't even bother to pitch BLT sandwiches or lobster. It's off the table. Not being considered.
Personal marketing plans run into the unstated table problem all the time. Is it off the table for you to quit your job, drop out of school, go back to school, speak up to your boss? I'm not asking if it's going to work or not, I'm just wondering if the possibility is even on the table.

Textbook rant,"I've spent the last few months looking at marketing textbooks. I'm assuming that they are fairly representative of textbooks in general, and since this is a topic I'm interested in, it seemed like a good area to focus on.
As far as I can tell, assigning a textbook to your college class is academic malpractice.
They are expensive.$50is the low end,$200is more typical. A textbook author in Toronto made enough money from his calculus textbook to afford a $20 million house. This is absurd on its face. There's no serious insight or leap in pedagogy involved in writing a standard textbook. That's what makes it standard. It's hard, but it shouldn't make you a millionaire.
They don't make change.Textbooks have very little narrative. They don't take you from a place of ignorance to a place of insight. Instead, even the best marketing textbooks surround you with a fairly non-connected series of vocabulary words, oversimplified problems and random examples.
They're out of date and don't match the course. The 2009-2010 edition of the MKTG textbook, which is the hippest I could find, has no entries in the index for Google, Twitter, or even Permission Marketing.They don't sell the topic.Textbooks today are a lot more colorful and breezy than they used to be, but they are far from engaging or inspirational. No one puts down a textbook and says, ""yes, this is what I want to do!""
They are incredibly impractical.Not just in terms of the lessons taught, but in terms of being a reference book for years down the road.
In a world of wikipedia, where every definition is a click away, it's foolish to give me definitions to memorize. Where is the context? When I want to teach someone marketing (and I do, all the time) I never present the information in the way a textbook does. I've never seen a single blog post that says, ""wait until I explain what I learned from a textbook!""
The solution seems simple to me. Professors should be spending their time devising pages or chapterettes or even entire chapters on topics that matter to them, then publishing them for free online. (it's part of their job, remember?)  When you have a class to teach, assemble 100 of the best pieces, put them in a pdf or on a kindle or a website (or even in a looseleaf notebook) and there, you're done. You just saved your intro marketing class about $15,000. Every semester. Any professor of intro marketing who is assigning a basic old-school textbook is guilty of theft or laziness.
This industry deserves to die. It has extracted too much time and too much money and wasted too much potential. We can do better. A lot better.

How big is your farm?,"If you own a lot of acres but just have a few bags of seed, you might be tempted to spread out what you've got and cover as much territory as you can. Farmers tell me that this is wasteful and time consuming. You end up with less yield and more work.
Marketers face the same dilemma.
The number of media channels available to you keeps growing. The number of places you can spend time and money is almost endless. Yet your budget isn't. Your time certainly isn't.
Some people would have you spend a little time on each social network, run ads in ten or fifteen media, focus on one hundred major marketsandspend time on PR and publicity in every publication willing to listen to you.

Should Hugh swear so much?,"Hugh MacLeod'snew bookon creativity is out today.
It's brilliant, and if you're willing to be pushed, it will push you.
Some people avoid Hugh's work because he's unafraid (even eager) to write about sex and to use language that looks good on Jack Nicholson. I have no problem with this, but a lot of people do, certainly at work.
So, the question: Should Hugh leave it out?
One school of thought says that if he wants to sell boatloads of books to frightened corporations, then yes, of course, he should and he must.
The other says, wait, you only get to write a classic book like this once in your life, how dare you make it less than you think it needs to be just to sell a few hundred thousand more copies.
JD Salinger took the latter advice. So did Hugh.
It's not commerce, it's art.
The irony, as most multimillionaire authors will tell you, is that it's art that creates the commerce, not the other way around. Hugh set out to write a book that matters, not a book that will please everyone.","June 11, 2009","Hugh MacLeod, creativity, art vs commerce"
Direct and useful project feedback,"I'm not talking about annual reviews (which are stupid). I'm talking about how you work as a client for a project that needs to make something.
It might be an internal team developing a website or it might be an outside designer working on a logo. Regardless of the team's make up, as their client, you walk a fine line. On one hand, you want their best, most creative insight, delivered with passion. On the other, you want the people you represent (your boss, the customers) to be happy with what gets made.
Which leads to the feedback part. (Not criticism, feedback).
What do you do when the work that comes in is no good? When it's off target or needs tweaking or even an overhaul?
In my experience, there are three different ways to structure the project. Each leads to a very different feedback loop.
1. The goal of the team is to please you.
2. The goal of the team is to make a product that they love and are proud of building.
3. The goal of the team is to build a great product.
There's more difference between #2 and #3 than it appears.
The first scenario is quite common. It leads to mindreader syndrome, in which alert team members work hard to get you to tell them what you want. If they can read your mind, they'll be successful (and done) that much sooner. The real problem with this approach is that the team has rarely bought in to the project. They don't take ownership because, after all, the goal is to make you happy. They won't give you more than you expect, because they're trying so hard to give you exactly what you expect. This is especially problematic when the team thinks you're an erratic, egomaniacal nutcase with little or no real world chops.
The second scenario is common with well-known freelance help, or agencies or other creatives that bring ego to the table. In this situation, anything you say about the project appears to be a personal attack. That's because, in the eyes of the person that came to you saying, ""here isour work,"" itisa personal attack. If you don't like my logo or strategy or code, well, of course I'm going to be defensive.
You can work with people like this successfully, but to do so involves giving them a clean sheet of paper, not being part of the development process.
The third scenario is the one in which all sides want the best possible projectandthe team believes that you have valuable insight on how to make that happen. This only works if there's mutual respect around the table. They have to hold you in esteem and trust your judgment (not organizational judgment, but judgment about what makes the project great). That means that, ""because I said so,"" is not effective feedback.
I've seen all three work. The first scenario is really efficient if you are truly in charge, you know what you want and you don't have a lot of time. The second scenario works if you absolutely trust the team and want them to push the envelope. And the third scenario works when you have mature people, a dedicated team and enough time and mutual respect to work it through.
How do you develop the trust and esteem you need in the third example? Sit with the team and jointly criticize other work. Before you start developing, spend time giviing feedback on how someone else could have done a better job (on a design, on the foley in a movie, on a logo). By earning the right to give feedback externally, you make it more likely you've got the right to do it internally.",,"project feedback, team dynamics, mutual respect"

Tough!,"I got some fascinating responses to yesterday'spost.
A few were from entitled college grads. They basically asked, ""With all this debt, how can I possibly do what you asked? Sure, some people might be able to do this, but I have no choice but to take a menial job, look for work and then party at night so I can have some friends.""
More, though, were from people who said, ""Yes! I can do this. I'll sleep on a friend's floor and eat beans and rice every night if I have to, but this is as much a part of my education as taking English 101 was."" I heard from three recruiters who violently agreed with this plan–who else would you hire?
Marketers have it tough today, just like job seekers, job holders, laid off people and people worrying about being laid off. It's not easy, very few people are getting what they deserve. You can't just run an ad or send in a resume and succeed.
Which is great news if your goal is getting through the Dip. It's great news because if you're a little tougher than people who are ready to give up, or you are a little more creative than people who are stuck, you'll break through.
I built my first internet company before and then during the dot com boom. It was far easier to do great work before everything heated up, far easier to stand out and far easier to make a difference. This is your moment, but I'm afraid it won't be easy.",,"perseverance, job market, determination"

“Why am I here?”,"This is a simple mantra that is going to change the way you attend every meeting and every conference for the rest of your life.
You probably don't have to be there. No gun held to your head, after all. So, why are you spending the time?
Do you have an agenda? It might be to change the agenda, or meet someone who will become a client or to learn something that will help you at work tomorrow.
Well, if that's why you're here, tell me again why you're just sitting there? If the only reason you came was to avoid the office, you need a new office. Quick, before the boss decides that for you.
Surely you have a question you can ask the speaker. Surely you have something interesting to say to the person sitting next to you. Surely you can do more than just sheepishly hand someone a business card they have no reason to save or remember or use.

Harvesting,"When you start a business, a brand or a project, there's a lot of work to be done. You must tell a story, build credibility and a permission asset. People don't trust you or believe you and you must earn their attention and trust. On top of that, you need skills, systems, machines and a team that works.
Quite an investment.
The goal is to reach the point where there's some harvesting going on. The first sales might cost you a hundred or thousand dollars each to make. At some point, though, you want sales to happen for free, people to show up with money. At some point, you want word of mouth to replace promotion and to earn back the money you invested up front.
That's why it's astonishing to me that people develop projects where harvesting is difficult or impossible. Here are some of the elements of a market where you are likely to reach the point where you can harvest the benefits of your investment:

If smart people in your industry are talking about an issue you don't know cold, it's very important that you don't just sit there and nod your head sagely. I think there are two constructive paths. The first is to ask. ""Wait, I was with you until a second ago. What does that mean?"" You'll be amazed at how smart and engaging this makes you seem if you say it at the right time.

Learning from the MBA program,"In November, I posted about an alternative MBA program that I was going to launch. Unaccredited, residential, free and six months long. A new way to learn about a new way of doing business.
We’re almost done, and it has exceeded every expectation I had for it, and I think there are some broader lessons worth sharing.
Launch and selection:More than 48,000 people visited thepagethat described the program and 350 really cool, talented people applied. I picked 27 finalists and all of them flew out to New York to meet each other. This was the most fun I’ve ever had at a cocktail party (it helped that it was at eight o’clock in the morning).
The conversations that day were stunning. Motivated people, all with something to teach, something to learn and something to prove. I asked each person to interview as many other people as they could. After three hours, I asked everyone to privately rank their favorite choices… “who would you like to be in the program with you?”
After they left, I tallied up the results. It was just as you might predict: nine or ten people kept coming up over and over in the top picks. I had crowdsourced the selection, and the crowd agreed. (It turns out that the people they picked were also the people I would have picked).
On January 20th, the most selective (one in 40 got in) MBA program in the world got started. Since then, they’ve never failed to live up to my hopes.
It's interesting to realize that the way I did the application process certainly changed the list of who applied. Same thing happens with jobs, I bet. Your applicants reflect your methods.
None of this would have worked if I was trying to manipulate the process or the people involved. My goal was easy to state and easy to live: I was there to teach (and hopefully to learn as well). The great news is that the students who appeared were beyond my wildest expectations.
Projects:I had originally planned on having people work on some of my ongoing projects, because, just as you can’t become a doctor without cutting bodies open, you can’t earn really learn an MBA without running something. It turned out that the group wanted to run their own stuff, not mine, so in fact the group didn’t mess with my stuff. Which was just fine.

Learning:The educational lesson that I found the most striking is that the book knowledge was easy to transmit and not particularly essential. Once you get this far, it's sort of a given that you're good at school. We read more than a hundred books, and the book learning happened quickly . Our culture has done an amazingly good job at teaching talented people how to learn concepts from books.
I taught for five to twenty hours a week, and very little of it was about the books. So, if concepts from books are easy, what’s hard?
Doing it.
Picking up the phone, making the plan, signing the deal. Pushing ‘publish.’ Announcing. Shipping.
We spent a lot of time on this area. Every morning, each person came in prepared to push someone in the group to overcome the next hurdle. This is what growth looks like, and it was energizing to be part of.
We didn’t do this at all at when I was at Stanford. We spent a lot of time reading irrelevant case studies and even more time building complex financial models. The thing is, you can now hire someone to build a complex financial model for you for $60 an hour. And a week’s worth of that is just about all the typical entrepreneur is going to need. The rest of the time, it’s about shipping, motivating, leading, connecting, envisioning and engaging. So that’s what we worked on.
It amazes me that MBA students around the world aren’t up in arms. How can schools justify taking $100,000 in cash and teaching exactly the wrong stuff?
Another lesson:The Samba blogshows just a tiny portion of the writing the group did. Everyone posted every day (sometimes on that blog and sometimes on our private blog), often personal items, sometimes questions or chaff. The act of defending your work in writing became a habit, and once it was a habit, the quality of everything improved.
Another lesson: We used Basecamp. It’s the perfect tool for coordinating this sort of work.
Another lesson: I kept an oversized (perhaps giant is a better word) Moleskine by the door, and we wrote down great moments and quotes as the days wore on. We’ve already worked our way through it frontwards, and now we’ve turned it over and are working back the other way.
There were some great guest lecturers as well.Derek Sivers, founder of CDBaby and David Simon, a former colleague from Yahoo both showed up.Doug Rushkoffcame by, as did designerRed Maxwell.Greg Linnfrom Columbia Records did a killer presentation about relationships as well. Stephanie Henry, who used to work in Ronald Reagan’s post-Presidential office stopped by. Uber-agentStuart Krichevskycame to talk about his business as well.Michael Cadertalked to us about publishing, and Bill Godin, the world's #1 manufacturer ofhospital cribscame by for a world-class presentation.

Field trips included a detailed exploration of the fabled Stew Leonard’s supermarket, an engagement with maestroRoger Nierenbergat the Essex House and first-hand lesson in leaning atFahnestock State Parkon skis. We also spent a beautiful morning withSarma Melngailis at her restaurant. Food seemed to show up a lot, and I was privileged to be allowed to cook lunch for all of us a few times a week. Not to mention discovering the power of melted ginger (on rice).
It’s surprising and disappointing that real companies don’t expose their people to this sort of learning. Too busy working, I guess.
While we’ve covered a lot, it’s pretty clear that this is a beginning for the crew, not the end.

Her unique skill is getting things done, and she wants a place where she can exercise that power to the fullest. Check out thesusanhiresabosssite for position qualifications and to apply.
As for me, this has been (and it’s not over yet) an extraordinary learning experience. I have no plans to do again immediately (so please don’t ask and please don’t apply!) but I promise that when I do something like this again, you’ll read about it here first.
Here’s what I told the group, “Maybe the most important thing you'll learn in this program is that you don't need this program. There's not much I'm going to tell you that's not in my blog posts or books. What this program will do is give you the structure and support to encourage you to do what you already know. But you can do that by yourselves.” I think that’s true for the people who weren’t able to be part of it as well.
Final takeaways:","June 4, 2009","MBA program, learning, entrepreneurship"
Out of bounds,"Sometimes people push back on posts of mine they don't like by telling me I'm out of bounds. Somehow, they say, I've crossed the boundary of what I'm allowed to write about. They are angry that I'm now writing about something outside my defined area.
I'm usually taken aback by this, because I didn't realize I'd actually agreed to any boundaries.
Brands run into this all the time. Consumers give them boundaries. Nike isn't allowed to make a computer, for example (unless they partner with Apple). It turns out, though, that marketers decide to believe in these boundaries a lot more than consumers do.
A beautifully made product or service (one that we agree with) gets a lot of slack, regardless of its source. Virgin is a great example of this. Branson can market cola and airplanes with the same brand, largely because we like what he makes. In Korea, there are a few massive brands that are 'allowed' to market anything they like, from dishwashers to cars. Google is allowed to market the very cool newSquares, of course.
The real problem is that when marketers believe they are going out of bounds, the work they do tends to be lousy. Starbucks attempt at chocolate, for example, wasn't as good at being chocolate as their coffee is at being coffee.I think that's because the marketers at Starbucks feel they have permission to care about coffee, but chocolate is merely an extension, an additional profit center, not a passion.
I'm not arguing for carte blanche craziness with your brand. American Express can do travelers checks and credit cards and could have done PayPal… but no, they probably shouldn't launch a line of whiskey any time soon. I am, however, arguing that once you have permission to talk to someone, finding new products or services for them is a smart way to grow.",,"boundaries, branding, marketing"
Thinking about the compromise,"If you sell crack to kindergarten students, no need to read this.
Same thing if you donate all your belongings and income to the poorest and sickest in the slums and ghettos.
The rest of us have compromised. We're not profit-maximizing sociopaths, nor are we saints. We're somewhere in between.
It'sinteresting to consider where we choose to compromise. I know peoplewith $50,000,000 in the bank who still don't believe that they haveenough, who still grind away at a job they don't like trying to earn another penny. I also knowfundraisers for non-profits (ones that they believe in) who aren'twilling to swallow hard and make a difficult fundraising pitch orpromote a new approach to raising money that might feel risky.
Wouldyou take a 10% pay cut to market a product you truly love and believein? Would you pass up a 15% raise to market something like Twinkies?
Everyoneis at their own level, but my impression is that most people sort ofrandomly end up somewhere on the greed/joy/work/good spectrum without reallyconsidering moving one way or the other.
If you've built yourlife around service to others, how much more could you accomplish ifyou were a little greedier? If you've built an expensive lifestylearound a well-paying job, what would happen to your life if youdownsized and sought out more joy or generosity?

Why joint ventures fail so often,"There are two reasons joint ventures fail. Thejointpart and theventurepart.
All ventures are risky, because they involve change and the unknown. We set off on a venture in search of something, or to make something happen–inherent in the idea of a venture is failure. It’s natural, then, for fearful people on both sides of a joint venture to back off when it gets scary. When given a choice between a risk and sure thing, many people pick the sure thing. So any venture begins with some question marks.
The joint part, though, is where the real problem arises. Pushing through the dip is the only way for a venture of any kind to succeed. The dip separates projects that begin from projects that finish. It’s easy and hopeful and exciting to start something, but challenging and often painful to finish it. When the project is a joint one, the pressure to push through the dip often dissipates. “Well, we only have a bit at stake here, so work on something else, something where we have to takeallthe blame.”
Because there isn’t one boss, one deliverable, one person pushing the project relentlessly, it stalls.
Every joint venture involves meetings, and meetings are the pressure relief valve. Meetings give us the ability to stall and to point fingers, to obfuscate and confuse. If a problem arises, if a difficulty needs to be overcome, it’s much easier to bury it at a meeting than it is to deal with it.
In my experience, you’re far better off with a licensing deal than a joint venture. One side buys the right to use an asset that belongs to the other. The initial transaction is more difficult (and apparently risky) at the start, but then the door is open to success. It’s a venture that belongs to one party, someone with a lot at stake and an incentive to make it work.Only one person in charge at a time.","June 2, 2009","joint ventures, failure, risk"
Won by a walk,"I was just informed by the resident baseball fan that the Mets won a game by a walk. By a walk!
Of course, in a 4 to 3 baseball game, you don't win by a walk. You win because before the walk, you scored three runs, and you win because before the walk you limited the other side to three runs. The walk was merely the last event.
The last event has huge impact for organizations. When a non-profit fundraiser brings home a million dollar donation, there's a lot of celebration and the fundraiser (deservedly) gets a lot of credit. But what about the person who started the group thirty years ago? Or the firm that named it or the volunteers that staff it or the heroic work one employee did in Rwanda? What about the CFO who has never missed a quarter in turning in tax returns or the admin who makes that donor feel so welcome every time she stops by?
Marketers take a lot of credit, because marketing is near the end of the game. Part of my mission is to move the work marketers do closer to the beginning of the game. Not because there's more glory there, but because there's more leverage. If you build the right thing in the first place, you're more likely to get a walk at the end.","June 1, 2009","non-profit, fundraising, marketing"

“All I do is work here”,"Over the past few months, I've had quite a few interactions with several people who work at a (previously great) brand.
One person will email to ask me for a favor or a connection, and I'll point out that just yesterday, I got three emails, all spam, from three different people at the organization either selling me something irrelevant or sending me a press release I didn't ask for.  And the unsubscribe button doesn't work. And I've unsubscribed ten times before. When I pointed this out, he said, ""Oh, that's those guys. I'm not related to them, all I do is work here. If you don't like getting that stuff, you should take it up with them.""
Then, a few days ago, I heard from someone in a different group at the same company, asking for help with a project she was working on. I explained that the last time I helped someone in her group with a project, I was misquoted, my time was wasted and they violated whatever trust we had. Susan said, and I'm quoting precisely the same line, ""All I do is work here. They pay my salary, but I'm me, not them.""
No, Susan,you are them.The reason your brand is falling apart is because so many of your colleagues are saying the same thing, denying the same responsibility. Consumers don't believe (or care) that there are warrens and fiefdoms and monarchies within your company. All they know is that you leverage that brand name every day, as you have for decades, but now, instead of using that brand to polish your reputation as an individual, you're being forced to accept responsibility for the actions of others.
Do you really think someone who worked for Bernie Madoff will go far with this line?

"Win, place or show?","One of the biggest brands in the world is getting ready to go online, and they're aiming to not win.
Sure, they've been online all along, but now it's become clear to them that the web is a real thing, and that a placeholder website and a few gimmicks aren''t sufficient. They're trying to generate online income and respect and audience.
Now, the choice: The safe thing is to organize to show. Showing up without glaring error and a major meltdown is something you can organize for. You say, ""well, if everything goes well, we'll be in the top ten in our industry, and perhaps we'll hit the top three.""In our industry. That means that when the overall global winners online are tallied up in a list at the end of the year, there's no way you're going to be on it. It means that the very things that made you one of the most powerful brands in the world will be missing, because all you're striving for is pretty good.
The challenge of shooting for a win is that it brings apparent risk with it. Not actual risk (the actual risk is in being mediocre, overlooked and on a slow death spiral) but apparent risk. The thing is that you overcame that risk when you built the original brand. You didn't set out then to be pretty good, good for your category, sort of important. You set out to matter.
So, Mr. Big Brand: organize to win. To do anything else is a waste of your time, your talent and your momentum.

Interpersonal relations have had thousands of years to develop. Online, there's been no time.
There are people who tweet in a way that rubs you the wrong way. Marketers who build businesses that seem scammy to you, or build websites that feel wrong. I get plenty of email from people that just doesn't feel right, whether it's in ALL CAPS or just difficult in tone or approach.
How do norms get formed? I think it's simpler than it looks: we interact with people who use the norm we use. We follow or read or hang out with people who use the same social constructs we do.
There might be people at the party down the street who are quite comfortable with each other and the things they're doing with or to each other… but you'd hate it. So you don't go.
Cliques form, which become communities and then, eventually a norm arrives. People like us like people like us.

Welcome to island marketing,"If you run a business on a small island, every interaction matters and every customer is precious.
There's a finite number of people you're going to be able to sell to, and every person you interact with knows everyone else, so you always have to be on your best behavior. You can't say, ""tough"" and then go on to the next person. You can't run ads that churn and burn through an endless supply of naive prospects. You only get one chance to make a first impression, and on the island, that impression matters.
Consider an airline in Chicago that can bully and bluster and greedify its way through an endless supply of business travelers, and compare them to a short hop carrier on Martha's Vineyard. The Vineyard airline knows that people can always switch to the other short hop airline or the ferry, and they also know that the folks they serve have power, because there aren't an endless supply.
As you've probably guessed, like most things in our ever shrinking world,all marketers are now on an island.
The island perspective is the Zappos model. Every interaction is both precious and an opportunity to delight. Marketers no longer have the money or the platform to harass and promote their way to success by burning through the market. Instead, we have to act like we're on an island earning and then nurturing a permission asset.
Through this lens, banner ads and various pop ups make even less sense than they used to. So does the insane act of outsourcing the random dialing of businesses to do telemarketing spam. We used up those resources a long time ago.","July 23, 2009","island marketing, customer interaction, Zappos model"

Death spiral!,"You've probably seen it. The fish monger sees a decline in business, so they have less money to spend on upkeep and inventory, so they keep the fish a bit longer and don't clean up as often, so of course, business declines and then they have even less money… Eventually, you have an empty, smelly fish store that's out of business.
The doctor has fewer patients so he doesn't invest as much in training or staff and so some other patients choose to leave which means that there are even fewer patients…
The newspaper has fewer advertisers, so they can't invest as much in running stories, so people stop reading it, which means advertisers have less reason to advertise which leaves less money for stories…
As Tom Peters says, ""You can't shrink your way to greatness,"" and yet that's what so many dying businesses try to do. They hunker down and wait for things to get better, but they don't. This isn't adip, it's a cul de sac. It's over.
Right this minute, you still have some cash, some customers, some momentum… Instead of squandering it in a long, slow, death spiral, do something else. Buy a new platform. Move. Find new products for the customers that still trust you.

Winning on the uphills,"Interesting business lesson learned on a bicycle:it's very difficult to improve your performance on the downhills.
I used to dread the uphill parts of my ride. On a recumbent bike, they're particularly difficult. So I'd slog through, barely surviving, looking forward to the superspeedy downhill parts.
Unfortunately, I had a serious accident a few years ago (saving the life of a clueless pedestrian by throwing myself onto the pavement). Downhill might be fast, but it's crazy.
Lesson learned. Now, I look forward to the uphill parts, because that's where the work is, the fun is, the improvement is. On the uphills, I have a reasonable shot at a gain over last time. The downhills are already maxed out by the laws of physics and safety.
The best time to do great customer service is when a customer is upset.The moment you earn your keep as a public speaker is when the room isn't just right or the plane is late or the projector doesn't work or the audience is tired or distracted. The best time to engage with an employee is when everything falls apart, not when you're hitting every milestone. And everyone now knows that the best time to start a project is when the economy is lousy.
Most of your competition spend their days looking forward to those rare moments when everything goes right. Imagine how much leverage you have if you spend your time maximizing those common moments when it doesn't.","July 21, 2009","Uphill challenge, customer service, continuous improvement"
He’s doing his best,"In fact, everyone is always doing their bestunder the circumstances. As my friend Al says, there's no such thing as irrational behavior. That's because in this moment, given the perceptions someone is holding, the way they behave is in fact the only way theycanbehave.
Consumers don't make choices as much as they react and respond to the inputs and assumptions they have about the marketplace, their life and your brand.
If you don't like the way someone is acting, understand you can't change his behavior, you can only change his circumstances.
This makes it really difficult to vilify the recalcitrant consumer. It's not that they're stupid, it's that you didn't explain it very well. As Zig has said, ""I can understand why you're not interested. Other people who believed [insert belief here] weren't interested either. But once they discovered [insert new fact here] they were eager to try it.""
Sure, people are willing to lie, break promises, willfully misunderstand, avoid responsibility and blame others. But why? They're doing it because under the circumstances, it seems like the right thing to do. As marketers, we can often change the circumstances.
There's an infamous scene in the Godfather where a movie producer turns down a 'reasonable' request from the Don. The Godfather is stunned. How could someone turn him down?
After the family kills the producer's prize racehorse (and puts it in his bed), the producer changes his mind.
What changed? Before the intervention, the producer didn't understand, didn't believe, didn't fear the Godfather. So he made what he believed was the best possible decision. Afterward, his worldview was forcibly changed and he made a different decision based on different facts.
Probably not a good idea to run around beheading horses, but it's a useful lesson in changing perception.","July 20, 2009","consumer behavior, circumstances, perception"
Dashboards,"Your users, employees, consumers and donors are obsessed with data now. Are you helping them solve their knowledge problem?
Years ago, I had an automatic transmission car with a tachometer. Why I needed to know my RPMs when I couldn't do a thing about it is beyond me.
Yet useless data and hidden data continue to plague users. I have aGarmin 305watch to track my bike workouts. It's just fine, except I hate it. I hate it because there are only two pieces of data I care about while I'm working out: how fast I'm going and what my heart rate is. My theory is that I can't do anything about time, but I can control effort, right?
Garmin puts my heartrate in 3 point type in the top right corner. It's unreadable by anyone old enough to be crazy to use one of these devices. And my speed? They convert miles per hour into some sort of runner's fraction that I still haven't figured out. Broken.
[I was wrong! It's not broken, the instructions are. My faithful readers have alerted me that I can fix the display, which I'm going to spend the next hour figuring out how to do. Sorry to offend the 305].
Acumen, on the other hand, has built a charitydashboardthat lets them evaluate projects on cost-effectiveness across sectors. It's a marvel, and it completely changes the way you think about philanthropy.
Or consider theambientdashboards that have been built in surprising ways. One company put pinwheels on a VPs desk. When sales went up, the pinwheels spun faster.
Just curious: what do you think would happen to energy consumption if every car registered in the US was required to have a digital mileage readout installed?
Building good dashboards isn't difficult, but it's an excellent marketing strategy. A few brainstorms:

The law of the little shovel,"If you want to dig a big hole, you need to stay in one place.
If you walk around town with a little shovel, you'll just end up digging thousands of little holes, not one big one.
Call on one person ten times and you might make the sale. Call on ten people once each and you will likely get ten rejections.
The important thing to remember is that separate events are often separate. If you use the same ineffective approach on one thousand people, it's not going to start working better just because you use it more often.
Connected events, on the other hand, often benefit from frequency and trust.
Which leads to two viable strategies:1. If you can stay still, stay still. Earn the trust, earn the sale by repeatedly demonstrating value and authority.
2. If you can't stay still, get a bigger shovel. Your marketing and your sales pitch has to be so refined and focused that it works the first time, because you don't get a second time.","July 18, 2009","sales strategy, trust, focus"
Walter’s lesson,"Here's the thing about the life of Walter Cronkite:

Instead, he always did the right thing because that's who he was. No sellouts, no political consulting, no false transparency.

How to make graphs that work,"1. Don't let popular spreadsheets be in charge of the way you look
92% of all the business presentations made in the United States are done with templates created by big companies in Excel or Powerpoint. This is a horrible tragedy.
First, programmers don't often have a lot of taste. The fonts are flaccid, the defaults are wan and uninspiring. There's no sophistication.
Second, and more important, when you show me something exactly like something I've seen a hundred times before, what do you expect me to do? Here's a hint: Zzzzzz.
2. Tell a story
There are only four reasons I can imagine you would want to show someone a graph (not a chart, or an infogram or a diagram, but a graph of numbers):
I think if it's the third one, you can probably dispense with the graph altogether. And the fourth isn't really a presentation, it's a working session. Which means you're trying to light a fire, make a point, highlight a trend, cause action to be taken. Your graph should reflect that, or you're wasting my time.
3. Follow some simple rules
When you violate the fundamental rules of graphing, you confuse me, or cause me to pay attention to parts of your presentation that aren't related to the story you're trying to tell. Here are a few:

4. Break some other rules
Use color. Use thick lines. Use circles. Use big type faces. Don't use 3-D charts unless you have a license. You can animate, but only if you have a note from your doctor.
If you break too many rules, it'll backfire. If the graph is hard to grok, or appears tweaked too much, we cease to believe it. [and theOnionchimes in, ht to Tom]",,"graphs, storytelling, design rules"
Mowing the lawn,"I used to hate the lawn.
Growing up, we lived on a curved street, and as a result, our house had a back lawn much bigger than normal. My job was to mow it, using an old, noisy, non-sharp, broken down mower. I remember it taking about 14 hours a week.
I hated everything about that lawn.
I wonder how your customer service people feel?
Does it show?
Every person who does marketing, sales, product design or any other job that influences customers directly should spend at least an hour a week answering the customer service lines, using the same tools your customer service people use.

Graduation day,"True confession: I didn't attend graduation from Stanford Business School. They mailed me my MBA instead. I hadn't been on campus in months, I was already busy running a brand in Boston, learning more than I could have in school. A generous teacher made sure I got the diploma (and of course, they got the tuition, so it was probably a fair trade).
Today, though, I attended final graduation for my informal free MBA program. You can read some of the student recapsright here. The photo was taken just before I fell in the Hudson River.
I'm thrilled at the new friends I've made (for life, probably) and thrilled at how much they learned, how smart they are and what a difference they'll make in the world. But most of all I'm thrilled that every single one of the nine realized that I had nothing much to do with their transformation, they did. Which means the opportunity is available to everyone, whether or not you get a cross country skiing lesson from me.
We didn't have a fancy commencement with speeches (actually, we had pizza). What we ended with was the idea, ""Go, make something happen.""

Gotcha!,"A few weeks ago, my tooth fell out (on a cross country flight no less). I managed to get home and then eagerly put some Anbesol (""for oral pain relief, dentist strong so the pain is gone!"") on the hole. Yes, that was my screaming you heard all the way from here.
The next morning, my dentist explained that not only doesn't Anbesol work on exposed nerves, it makes them worse.
You can read the label all day long and you won't see that mentioned. But hey, they made a sale (onesale).
Or considerthis itemon Amazon. How big do you think these ""mixing bowls"" are? The reviews point out that the smallest one is not big enough to hold an egg. Does that change your perception of the item?
Why not tell the truth? Why not call them ""mini bowls""? Why not change the label from ""toothache relief""? (Technically, it's not a toothache if you have no tooth, okay, thank you Mr. Lawyer, that's exactly the sort of weaseling I'm talking about.)
There are lots of things you can do to make the sale. They often are precisely the opposite of what you should do to generate word of mouth. I know, you can't have word of mouth unless you have a sale, but a sale that leads to pain is hardly worth it.
My rule of thumb is this: every person you turn away because your product or service isn't right for them turns into three great customers down the road. Every bad sale costs you five.",,"tooth pain, consumer deception, sales strategy"
"Facts always win, right?","If you're selling a business to business service and you can prove that it's better, that it delivers more value, that it's cheaper or more durable or more efficient, shouldn't that mean you will close every sale?
Even hard-headed business people end up buying the thing they want, not the thing they necessarily need.
The real danger of relying on facts to make your sale, though, is that when the facts are no longer on your side, you're toast. The low-cost supplier gets hooked on the easy sales that come from acting like a commodity, and if that changes, you've got little room to maneuver.
Great brands and projects are built on real value and a real advantage, but great marketers use this as a supporting column, not the entire foundation. Instead, they build a story on top of their head start. They focus on relationships and worldviews and interactions, and use the boost from their initial head start to build competitive insulation.","July 14, 2009","Sales strategy, value proposition, storytelling"
The CPM gap,"Ads online typically cost $5 to $20 for one thousand impressions. A fancy magazine might cost two or three times that. But it's still pennies a person.
Attending a conference, on the other hand, costs $1000 by the time you add up the expenses. That's a CPM of $1,000,000. One thousand of the right people at the right conference costs a million dollars, as opposed to $12 for the same thousand people online.
That seems nuts. Same people, radical difference in price.Apples and oranges.It's not a valid comparison because one is about ads and interruptions, the other is from the point of view of the conference organizer or the attendee awash in attention and connection…
Here's the thing: advertisers treat prospects online as targets, as victims, as people to subject to interruption. Conferences treat attendees as royalty, as paying customers who invested time and money to be there.
And that's the difference. As long as your site is about something else and the ads are a distraction, you'll see CPM rates drop. As soon as you (or the advertisers) figure out that creating online communities aligned with the advertising, where attendance is a choice by the consumer, then you're creating genuine value.
The irony is that advertisers continue to push media people to create the very environments that don't work. They want a bigger M and a lower C.
Far more useful for everyone to do the opposite. Pay a lot and get more than you pay for.","July 13, 2009","CPM gap, advertising, conference value"

In my experience, 40% of the fee goes for the work and 60% goes to pay for the do-overs, staffing, project management and hassle that comes from working from big organizations and committees.A lot of small businesses get burned when they charge just the 40% and the client expects that the other 60% comes for free.

"Quality, scale and the regular kind","When we talk about quality, it's easy to get confused.
That's because there are two kinds of quality being discussed. The most common way it's talked about in business is ""meeting specifications."" An item has quality if it's built the way it was designed to be built.
There's another sort of quality, though. This is the quality of, ""is it worth doing?"". The quality of specialness and humanity, of passion and remarkability.
Hence the conflict. The first sort of quality is easy to mandate, reasonably easy to scale and it fits into a spreadsheet very nicely. I wonder if we're getting past that.
Consider two eggs:
If I go the local diner, I can get a high quality diner egg, over easy. The egg is a standard manufactured egg, created in quantity by drugged chickens in prison. It retails (raw) for about 14 cents. The egg is cooked on a griddle the way it always is, a grill neither spotless nor filthy, covered with a sheen of slightly old oil. It's cooked on one side until set, flipped for a few seconds, put on a plate, given a shake of iodized salt and served, usually with a piece of generic white bread toast.
This is the regular kind. The kind most people grew up with. Easy to produce on demand, reliable and expected.
If I make an egg at home, I'll use a free range egg from the farmer's market, which I'll happily pay 39 cents for. This egg tastes like an egg, and the extra money pays for a local farmer and a (slightly) happier chicken. I'd cook it in a very hot cast iron skillet with really tasty olive oil, and I'd leave it in longer until it gets crisp around the edges, then I'd put some David's salt on it (which, due to its pointy edges, in fact does taste better). All told, it costs about thirty one cents more altogether.
This is the undependable kind. You might not be able to get the eggs. Cleaning the pan is more work too. But this is a remarkable egg, an egg worth talking about, an egg worth crossing the street for, an egg worth writing about.
If you can do this to an egg for thirty cents, imagine what happens when you bring the same approach to quality to your job.","July 10, 2009","Quality, Value, Remarkability"

Taking the leap,"The best businesses and the best projects are a quantum leap above the competition. This gulf represents competitive insulation, because others can't figure out how to get up there with you.
Amazon, for example, has a leap between it and other online retailers. Sure, you might be able to mimic part of what they've got, but the gulf is so huge, it's hard to imagine displacing them any time soon.
Nike has spent billions on advertising, sponsorship, manufacturing, technology and distribution. It's a quantum leap between them and some start-up that wants to compete.
I think going for the leap is essential for creating a business for the ages, and I want to speculate that there are three ways to make it:

The confusion,"We frequently confuse internal biochemistry (caused by habits and genetics) with external events. If we didn't, marketing wouldn't work nearly as well.
Our brains are busy processing chemicals that internally change our moods, but find a way to rationalize those mood changes based on events and purchases in the outside world. We often act as though money can buy joy, but of course, it works better when we're joyful in the first place.
We don't say, ""I'm genetically pre-disposed to mild depression,"" or ""I haven't exercised in a while and I spend a lot of time watching TV,"" instead, we say, ""I'm disappointed because I don't make enough money and my boss is mean to me."" And yet, someone in the very same circumstances seems much happier than we are. And somehow, nothing ever happens in our career that makes everything all right forever.
We don't say, ""I'm grouchy because of hormones."" Instead, we say, ""He deserved that outburst. He was being a jerk."" Of course, he was the same guy last week and you sort of liked him.
We don't say, ""When I dress and act like the people around me, I can feel safe as a member of their tribe."" Instead, we think, ""I feel good when I'm with my friends.""
We don't say, ""I have a very complex relationship with money because my parents spoiled me."" Instead, we say, ""Hey, the bankgaveme a credit card so it's okay to buy things that I deserve.""
We don't say, ""I eat to drown out the way I feel about my mom,"" instead we say, ""Hey, if it's on a salad bar, it must be good for me. And anyway, next month is my birthday.""
The external world is remarkably consistent, and yet we blame it for what's going on inside of us. People who think the world is going to end always manage to find a new thing that's going to cause it to end. People itching to be bummed out all day long will certainly find an external event that give their emotion some causal cover. The thinking happens long before the event that we blame the thinking on.
Products are remarkably similar, yet we use their marketing stories as an extension of our self-image and self-esteem. Should a new phone really make you that happy?
Colleagues are almost always trying to work with us, yet it's easy to blame them when anxiety about other events triggers time-honored patterns in our behavior.
Hang out at the mall two weeks before the prom. Can those items on the rack really pacify the raging anxieties of the teenagers waiting to buy them (or is the social triggers that do it)? Watch McKinsey doing a multimillion dollar consulting gig for a Fortune 500 company. Are they really telling the board something that couldn't have been discovered by a few talented folks in the finance department? Or are they paying for peace of mind?
Marketers spend billions of dollars identifying common biochemical events, and then they launch products and services with stories that align with those events. As a result, we spend money on external forces in an attempt to heal internal pain. Marketers want the equation to be, ""if you buy this, everything will be all right.""

Everyone else reads it,"The reason the New York Times matters isn't about the delivery of news (it's old by the time it arrives) or even the analysis (which is often spotty or wrong or banal or biased or boring). No, the reason it matters is because everyone else reads it.
That's the reason certain trade shows matter.
Or industry journals or blogs.
You can change the definition of ""everyone"" and customize it for your industry or passion, but the fact is, we need to read what everyone else is reading in order to have a sense of being in sync. If it's in there, it matters, because everyone else read it.
If a publication like this doesn't exist, go ahead and create it, because you'll profit.
The internet eliminates the friction and the barriers that made it natural for there to be just a few media outlets per sector. This change led to an explosion in choices. But as things settle down, we're busy searching for the thing that 'everyone else' who matters reads.

The problem with telling people to go away is that they go away. And the problem with treating all customers the same is that customers aren't the same. They're different and they demand to be treated (and are often willing to pay) differently.
So, why not smile and say, ""Oh, wow, that's a rush. We can do it, but it's expensive. It'll cost you $90. I know that's a lot, but there you go.""
Outcome: Maybe they'll still leave. But maybe they'll happily pay you for the privilege of doing business with you. Why should this be your choice, not theirs?
If you do tax accounting for mid-size businesses, why not offer a special last-minute service? A service in which you process shoeboxes filled with unsorted papers? A service that costs less but happens during your slow season?
There are two really good reasons to turn down special requests:
1. because you're marketing yourself as extremely busy and perfectly willing to turn down good work.
2. because you want to market yourself as someone who is a rigid artist, a stick in the mud or a crotchety perfectionist. This works great for pizza places.","July 3, 2009","customer service, special requests, pricing strategy"
The purpose of a book cover,"(and I think it works for lots of products)
Is the purpose of the cover to sell books, to accurately describe what's in the book, or to tee up the reader so the book has maximum impact?
The third.
It's the third because if the book has maximum impact, then word of mouth is created, and word of mouth is what sells your product, not the cover.
Tactically, the cover sells the back cover, the back cover sells the flap and by then you've sold the book. If those steps end up selling a book that the purchaser doesn't like, game over. So you have to be consistent all the way through and end up creating a conversation after the purchase. Books are better at creating conversations than most products (when was the last time you talked about a pool cue), but there's lots of opportunity here, no matter what you make.

The risk/reward confusion,"It's easy to to adopt the policy of avoiding risk at all costs, that whenever possible, the products you launch or the engagements you have should be flawless and without downside.
Here's the problem: in most endeavors, a small increase in risk can double the reward. It's theseconddoubling of reward that brings serious risk with it. But the first leap is relatively painless.
In the chart above, notice that going from point A to point B brings almost no incremental risk. It might feel scary, but rationally, it's not. Doubling reward again from B to C, though, brings significant incremental risk. It's this second doubling that gets you through the Dip, that leads to a breakthrough, that makes you remarkable.
But I'm not even talking about that. I'm just hoping you'll warm up by making the tiny leap of avoiding all risk. Riskless is hardly worth your effort.","July 1, 2009","risk, reward, breakthrough"
Who gets to decide what you want?,"When George Washington was a teenager, did he really, really, really want a car?
Unlikely.
In order to want something, you probably need to know it exists. But my guess is that it surely helps if you've been marketed to.
One definition of happiness is wanting the things you're likely to get (or, conversely, not wanting the unattainable). One definition of marketing is persuading the world it wants what you have, regardless of whether they can afford it or not.
We don't hesitate to motivate employees by marketing them the benefits of being promoted, even if they all can't possibly get this. We don't hesitate to tease kids by marketing every conceivable unattainable Christmas gift at them, relentlessly.
Teenage girls are taught what to want by magazines and by peers.
Patients are taught what to want by doctors who prescribe new tests. And doctors are taught to do that by lawyers eager to sue if they don't. Imagine going home and saying, ""the doctor wanted to give me another test, but I said no…""
This cycle of assigned wants is going to get a lot worse before it gets better. The game theory demands it.
And so, once again it seems to come down to a personal decision. If you decide what you want (instead of letting someone else decide for you) perhaps you could choose the things that would actually bring you and your loved ones the satisfaction you can live with.","August 31, 2009","decision-making, marketing influence, personal satisfaction"
The problem with doing it by heart,"The following does not appear in the Star Spangled Banner:
""Babe Ruth through the night…""
When you do something by heart, it bypasses some of the common sense processing we use to navigate our day. Of course Babe Ruth wasn't even a sparkle in Mrs. Ruth's eye during the War of 1812, but if you're singing by heart, you don't think about it.
I walked into a cheap noodle joint in Soho last month and decided I wanted tofu with vegetables. They had a little plate on display (a special, I guess) and I asked for tofu, vegetables, no sauce. The cashier pointed to the display model and said, ""like this?""
I said, ""with no sauce,"" because the gloppy stuff didn't appeal to me.
So, after asking, clearly, twice, I sat down. Four minutes later, they called my number and handed me an identical copy to the display item, oozing with fluorescent sauce.
""I was hoping that there'd be no sauce…""
She didn't miss a beat. She said, ""that's the way it always comes.""
She wasn't being evil. She was merely doing it by heart. Just like the intolerant judgmental guy who can quote you chapter and verse from his spiritual book of choice but never thought about the meaning of the words inside or the status quo protecting technician who isn't a scientist because she's afraid of violating something that feels like a law.

Two ways to hire (and a wrong way),"The wrong way first: interview someone for an hour. If you like them, have them interview three or four other people in your organization for an hour each.
You've invested five hours of your team's time, but really you only were looking for approval, because you'd already decided you liked the person enough to work with them for years.
All the evidence we've seen shows that this is a lousy predictor of future performance. And, let's tell the truth… if the first three people love the guy, are you really going to let the fourth, junior person veto him? Or is it just an annoying courtesy?
There are two approaches you can use as an alternative.
First, you can work with someone for months before you offer them a job. Your pool is smaller (freelancers, joint venture partners, interns) but the exposure to how they work is spectacularly different. You don't get the thrill of finding a pearl in the oyster, the ""wow, I found the most incredible hire!"" bragging rights. Instead, you get exactly what you expect. Organizing for this sort of hiring isn't particularly difficult, particularly in a down economy. Not surprisingly, I've had 100% success doing this.
Second, and with some controversy, you can admit that an hour interview is actually a five minute sniff test followed by 55 minutes of wasted time, multiplied by four colleagues. Tell the truth and switch to five minute interviews.
If you do five minute initial interviews, you can interview 12 times as many people for each job opening. This initial filtering takes precisely as much time as your wasted one-hour approach, but dramatically increases the chance you'll find someone you actually have good pheromone and body language connection with. After the screening, I can only encourage you to do the projects, reference checks and other serious diligence you're probably too exhausted to do after spending all those hours with one person…
This process takes a lot of work, but it definitely works. If you can interview 60 people in a day or two and then have the three best fits do projects, presentations and freelance work for you, you're way ahead of a company that interviewed only three people and fell in love with one.","August 29, 2009","Hiring Strategies, Interviewing Techniques, Performance Prediction"
Spare no expense!,"The problem with customer service is not a new one. It's about balancing between serving a lot of people a little, or dropping everything to serve a few people a lot.
Getting a lot of benefit for a lot of people for not so much money isn't particularly difficult. In the chart on the right, for example, (a) represents the cost of good signage at the airport, or clearly written directions on the prescription bottle or a bit of training for your staff. It pays off. Pay a little bit and you help a lot of people to avoid hassles. The utility per person isn't huge, but you can help a lot of people at once.
(b) is the higher cost of a bit of direct intervention. This is the cost of a call center or a toll free number or an information desk. You're paying more, you're helping fewer people, but you're helping them a lot.
(c) is where it gets nuts. (c) is where we are expected to spare no expense, where the CEO has to get involved because it's a journalist who's upset, or where we're busy airlifting a new unit out to a super angry customer. The cost is very high, the systems fall apart and only one person benefits.
Of course, if you're that one person, you think it's not only fair, but appropriate and right.
This ""spare no expense"" mantra is extremely difficult to avoid, because in any given situation, when the resources are available, your inclination is to say, ""make the problem go away, spend the money!""
It's certainly possible to build a brand without going to (c) (witness the way Google almost never gets embroiled in special cases or even answers the phone–I know that they're certainly not eager to fix my imap problems), but once you've trained your customers that (c) is an option, it's awfully hard to scale back.
The reason we get trapped by (c) is that, ""I'm doing the best I can"" is always much easier than, ""we need to be disciplined and help more people, even if that means that some special cases will fall through the cracks. The internet makes this even more difficult because people who fall through the cracks are able to amplify their complaints ever louder.
The way around it, I think, is to set expectations early and often. If you're going to give me your phone number, you better answer it. If you're going to offer a warranty, you better honor it. If you position yourself as a company with real people eager to make every single person happy–you better deliver.
No matter what, you should decide. In advance. How much do you want to spend on ad hoc emergencies, how much do you want to reserve on design and helping the masses improve their experience?","August 28, 2009","Customer service, resource allocation, expectations management"
“We don’t compare ourselves to other airport restaurants”,"Atlanta brags about having the busiest airport in the world. Like most municipal facilities, they don’t brag about having the best, the most pleasant, the most engaging or the most remarkable airport in the world.
That’s a shame, because airports are great opportunities to create value. Lots of curious, alert people with money to spend and connections to make. Yet the lowest-common-denominator is served, relentlessly. If you like fried meat, plenty to choose from. You’d think that rather than cater to the center of the curve 100 times at 100 concessions, they’d pay attention to some of the outliers now and then…
Imagine my delight, then, when I stumbled upon One Flew South, located at Terminal E. Perhaps because it’s at the end of the line, the economic and turnover pressure is less. Regardless, it’s better than we have been taught we should deserve. Jerry the general manager explained why in the simple quote that leads this post off. He’s busy comparing the place to other restaurants, not to other airports. (If you go, say hi to Carolyn at the bar. Tell her I sent you and she’ll take care of you.)

Competing with the singleminded,"I was talking with a few executives from one of the biggest technology companies in Europe, and they were explaining how their hands were tied in moving forward on the internet. They were doing the best they could under the circumstances, of course, but there were units in their organization that needed to be protected, prices that needed to be supported, sacred cows that couldn't be touched. After all, they argued, how could they wipe out their current business just to succeed online?
This conversation happens every single day at organizations large and small. You want to do the new thing, but of course you must do it in a measured, rational way.
Which is great, unless your competition doesn't agree.
When you have someone who is willing to accomplish A without worrying about B and C, they will almost always defeat you in accomplishing A. Online, of course, this often leads to doom, since there are many organizations that are willing to get big at the expense of revenue, or writers willing to be noticed at the expense of ethics or reputation. But in the short run, the singleminded have a fantastic advantage. And sometimes, their singleminded focus on accomplishing just that one thing (whatever it is) pushes them through the Dip far ahead of you and then yes, they make a ton of money and you've lost forever.

The massive attention surplus,"There was an attention drought for the longest time. Marketers paid a fortune for TV ads (and in fact, network ads sold out months in advance) because it was so difficult to find enough attention. Ads worked, so the more ads you bought, the more money you made, thus marketers took all they could get.
This attention shortage drove our economy.
The internet has done something wacky to this situation. It has created a surplus of attention. Ads go unsold. People are spending hours on YouTube or Twitter or Facebook or other sites and not spending their attention on ads, because the ads are either absent or not worth watching.
When people talk about the problem with free online, they're missing the point. Free is creating lots of attention, but marketers haven't gotten smart enough to do something profitable with that attention.
Hint: funny commercials with chimps won't be the answer.
It turns out that the almost infinitely long tail of attention varieties is what will kick open the monetization of online attention.Yes, I will give my attention to an ad, but only if it's anticipated, personal and relevant. We still give permission to marketers that earn it, but so few marketers do.
Simple example: Ten years ago, there was nowhere for a company likeBest Made Axeto advertise. Today, with billions of tiny micromarkets, it's not hard to imagine many audiences of one or two or three or ten that would be delighted to know about their products. Right now, there's no easy way for a marketer to conceptualize that effort, never mind execute it, though it's surely coming.
Big companies, non-profits and even candidates will discover hyperlocal, hyperspecialized, hyperrelevant… this is where we are going, and it turns out that this time, the media is way ahead of the marketers.","August 24, 2009","Attention surplus, online marketing, personalization"
Thanks for leading,"I want to thank those that have supported my bookTribes.It's been the #1 bestselling leadership book on Amazon for the last 300days, mostly because the people who like it, talk about it and spreadthe word.
Here's a favorite excerpt:
Leadership is scarce because few people are willing to go through the discomfort required to lead.
The scarcity makes leadership valuable. If everyone tries to lead all the time, not much happens. It’s discomfort that creates the leverage that makes leadership worthwhile.
In other words, if everyone could do it, they would, and it wouldn’t be worth much.
It’s uncomfortable to stand up in front of strangers.It’s uncomfortable to propose an idea that might fail.It’s uncomfortable to challenge the status quo.It’s uncomfortable to resist the urge to settle.
When you identify the discomfort, you’ve found the place where a leader is needed.

Not so good at math,"A simple quiz for smart marketers:
Let's say your goal is to reduce gasoline consumption.
And let's say there are only two kinds of cars in the world. Half of them are Suburbans that get 10 miles to the gallon and half are Priuses that get 50.

Brands that matter,"In this era, there are two questions every marketer answers:
If you think about dead brands like Tide or United Airlines, the answer to both questions is clearly 'no'.

"Patient capital, markets that work and ending the endless emergency of poverty","Multiply the population of the US by three. That’s how many people around the world live on about a dollar a day.
Do it again and now you have the number closer to $2.About forty percent of the world lives on $2 or less a day.
What’s that like? What happens to you when you have two dollars a day to live on. It’s almost impossible to imagine. I mean, $2 is the rent on your apartment for about 45 minutes. $2 buys you one bite of lunch at a local restaurant…
And yet, two billion people survive on that sort of income.
The key issue is ‘survive’. Subsistence income means that you have the barest possible cushion, that every penny is spent and you are on the edge at all times. It makes life an emergency.
If every single thing goes perfectly, then you and your family will go to sleep tonight healthy, not too hungry and fairly safe. But of course, every single thing almost never goes perfectly. If you are bitten by a malaria-carrying mosquito, you need to buy medicine and so there’s no money for food. If you need more water, you have to spend two hours walking to and from the nearest half-decent water spot, and those two hours are the two hours you were going to spend harvesting the food your kids need.
From a fundraising point of view, this endless emergency is exactly what a non-profit needs to find and close donors. A dollar donated today will save someone’s life. It will. One dollar, one life. That’s urgent. As urgent as it gets.
The problem, of course, is that it doesn’t save that person's life forever, it saves it for today. Tomorrow, there’s another emergency, and yesterday’s dollar is gone. So you need another dollar. Two billion people, two billion dollars. Every day. Today, tomorrow, the day after that. It’s an endless emergency, and it never gets better.
That’s where patient capital comes in. It starts with this belief:
The difference between being one penny behind and one penny ahead is profound.
If you’re one penny behind, then every day you fall further back. Every day, the emergencies get worse, the stress gets worse, your ability to survive (never mind thrive) gets worse.
If you’re one penny ahead, though, just a penny, then every day you build a reserve, every day you are able to invest in productivity or peace of mind, and soon you are two pennies or a dollar or five dollars a day ahead. And then you can send your daughter to college. And then you can buy something from the merchant next door. And then you can plant a better crop. And then you have a stake in the community, and then the world changes.
So, how to create this micro surplus? How to prime the pump of the system to improve productivity enough that things get better?
Markets.
When two people trade, both win. No one buys a bar a soap unless the money they’re spending for the soap is worth less to them than the soap itself.
When someone in poverty buys a device that improves productivity, the device pays for itself (if it didn’t, they wouldn’t buy it.) So a drip irrigation system, for example, may pay off by creating two or three harvests a year instead of one.
What does that do for the family that buys it? Well, if you have one harvest a year and you’re living at subsistence, it means your income is zero, or probably just a little below. If you can irrigate and get two or three harvests a year, though, your income goes up by infinity. Now, instead of making -1 pennies a day, you’re making 100 or 200 pennies a day. That’s a surplus of $700 a year. That’s enough to participate in other productivity or life-enhancing investments, like a well, or a roof, or health care. Now, the edge is a lot further away.
And what does that do for the family that sells it? When markets arrive, productivity increases and new innovations can be diffused more quickly, because change is brought in by the market.
How doesAcumen Fundcreate these markets? The answer is patient capital. The companies that are selling solar lamps to replace kerosene or water purification systems in tiny villages, or housing projects for peasants in Pakistan or even ambulance services in Mumbai fully intend to make a profit, but the venture capitalists on Sand Hill Road aren’t in a hurry to invest in them. The investments are a little too risky, take a little too long or a little too unproven to take a chance on.
So Acumen finds these entrepreneurs on site in the developing world, funds them, teaches them and pushes them to build really big organizations. A to Z has literally thousands of people in their modern factory creating malaria bed nets in Tanzania. And so it grows.
I’m thrilled at the work Acumen has done, and excited about where the fund is going. I’ve got some interesting fundraising ideas to share with you this fall, and I thought it was worth taking you through my reasoning as to why I chose this organization as the recipient.
Any entrepreneur or marketer can learn a lesson from how new systems create new markets, and how an infinite increase in income or productivity can change everything. Everything.","August 20, 2009","Patient capital, poverty, markets"
The modern talking pad,"I think this is a big idea, but your mileage may vary.
I've been having great success with a hybrid of the yellow legal pad and a printed presentation from Keynote (or Powerpoint). I use it during small meetings where more interactivity is useful, and where the group is too small for a laptop to be the best way to present slides (I think running a presentation says, ""I talk, you listen…"")
Here's how it works:
Now, when you make your presentation, sit next to the person you're meeting with and go through the booklet page by page,writing directly on each page. As you work your way through the ideas in the booklet, the two of you can talk about what's in front of you and mark it up.
It's not a brochure, it's the outcome of a working session. Leave it behind when you go.",,"modern talking pad, interactive presentations, hybrid approach"
The talking pad,"ZigZiglartaught me about the most powerful way to use a yellow legal pad. He calls it a ""talking pad.""
When you're in a small meeting (you and one or two other people) it's awkward to use a laptop or Powerpoint, because it destroys the intimacy of the discussion. Basically, it says, ""I'm going to talk to the screen and you can watch, okay?""
The alternative is to use a thick pen or marker and a legal pad.
Whenever you mention a number or make an assertion or promise, write it down. The act of writing is a verb, it's the process of putting it on the page that underlines what you've said, that highlights the moment. You're also creating a record of what you said, which emphasizes that you're not a weasel.
Salespeople can use this technique as well. Let's say you're trying to sell energy-efficient windows. They cost $800 each, the person needs 30, so you're trying to make a $24,000 sale. That's a big deal, right?
Start by writing these facts down.
Then, working with the person you're sitting with, identify how much is going to be saved every day. Not your opinion, but their estimate based on their energy bill and comparable homes. Agree on a number. Write it down.
Cut it in half. Now it's truly a realistic, conservative estimate. Write it down.
Multiply it by the number of windows. Write it down. People hate math.
Now, pull out your calculator and figure out the cost of the monthly financing. Oh! The cost is way lower than the amount saved. The windows are free.

The long tale,"(not a typo).
The long tale is the never-ending story you tell your prospects, your customers and your employees.
The hard part is getting a little bit of permission to start telling your tale. The overlooked part, the part that wastes all that permission, is that you forget to keep telling your story.
Are you really the same as you were a year ago? How often do you re-introduce yourself? What's truly new (as opposed to what does the salesforce think is new)? What's the next chapter that matters? Almost all the goodness of marketing comes not from the big announcement, but from the long tale.

Education at the crossroads,"Actually, there isn't one, there are three choices that anyone offering higher education is going to have to make.
Should this be scarce or abundant?
MIT and Stanford are starting to make classes available for free online. The marginal cost of this is pretty close to zero, so it's easy for them to share. Abundant education is easy to access and offers motivated individuals a chance to learn.
Scarcity comes from things like accreditation, admissions policies or small classrooms.
Should this be free or expensive?
Wikipedia offers the world's fact base to everyone, for free. So it spreads.
On the other hand, some bar review courses are so expensive the websites don't even have the guts to list the price.
The newly easy access to the education marketplace (you used to need a big campus and a spot in the guidance office) means that both the free and expensive options are going to be experimented with, because the number of people in the education business is going to explode (then implode).
If you think the fallout in the newspaper business was dramatic, wait until you see what happens to education.
Should this be about school or about learning?
School was the big thing for a long time. School is tests and credits and notetaking and meeting standards. Learning, on the other hand, is 'getting it'. It's the conceptual breakthrough that permits the student to understand it then move on to something else. Learning doesn't care about workbooks or long checklists.
For a while, smart people thought that school was organized to encourage learning. For a long time, though, people in the know have realized that they are fundamentally different activities.
The combinations…
Imagine a school that's built around free, abundant learning. And compare it to one that's focused on scarce, expensive schooling. Or dream up  your own combination. My recent MBA program, for example, was scarce (only 9 people got to do it) and it was free and focused on learning.
Just because something is free doesn't meant there isn't money to be made. Someone could charge, for example, for custom curricula, or focused tutoring, or for a certified (scarce) degree. When a million people are taking your course, you only need 1% to pay you to be happy indeed.
Eight combinations of the three choices are available and my guess is that all eight will be tried. If I were going to wager, I'd say that the free, abundant learning combination is the one that's going to change the world.","August 17, 2009","Higher Education, Abundant Learning, Scarcity"

Willfully ignorant vs. aggressively skeptical,"Challenging the status quo is what I do for a living. Either that or encourage other people to do it.
But there are two ways to do it, and one of them is ineffective, short-sighted and threatens the fabric of the tribe. The other seems to work.
I heard someone screaming about death panels and how the government was not only going to kill his grandmother, but would take outStephen Hawkinghimself if it had the chance.
The screaming is a key part, because screaming is often a tool used to balance out the lazy ignorance of someone parroting opposition to an idea that they don't understand. (If you want to write to me about this post, please write to me about the screaming part, not about whether or not you agree with the facts or the science. That's what the post is about, the screaming.)
If you want to challenge the conventional wisdom of health care reform, please do! It'll make the final outcome better. But if you choose to do that, it's essential that you knowmoreabout it than everyone else, not less. Certainly not zero. Be skeptical, but be informed (about everything important, not just this issue, of course). Screaming ignorance gets attention, but it distracts us from the work at hand.
It's easy to fit in by yelling out, and far more difficult to actually read and consider the facts. Anytime you hear, ""I don't have the time to understand this issue, I'm too busy being upset,"" you know that something is wrong.
Brands face this as much or more than politicians do. I witnessed a knock-down fight between two teenagers over which operating system was best. There are generations of arguments between Ford and Chevy owners. Motorcycle gangs are often parochial in their choice of bike. And in each case, the less people know, the more they yell.
If you want to change what your boss believes, or the strategy your company is following, the first step is to figure out how to be the best informed person in the room.","August 15, 2009","ignorance, skepticism, informed debate"
Free work vs. internships,"I think internships are overrated. Most of the time, the employer thinks he's doing the intern a favor, but he doesn't trust the interns to do any actual thoughtful, intelligent work worth talking about. And to be fair, most of the time the interns are busy hiding, not grabbing responsibility but instead acting like they're in school, avoiding hard work and trying to get an A.
Charlie Hoehn has written a beautifully designedebookthat may change the way you think about this. His argument is that 'free work' is something else entirely. It's done as a freelancer, remotely, without direct supervision and it creates a measurable output.
Free work isn't easy to get. Big companies, for example, have bureaucrats that don't often know what to do with a great offer like this. And some people (I'll put myself in this category) are too hands-on to take advantage of it. But you'd be amazed at how many fast-moving companies or influential individuals are all too happy to share credit if it helps the work get done.
And the benefit to the underemployed? You guessed it: great experience and a resume builder that actually means something.

If you have a photo you can share (see fine print below) of someone you work with, buy from, sell to or interact with professionally–someone who matters, who contributes, who makes a difference–I'd love to include it. It might be your boss, a copyeditor, a waiter, a craftsperson or even (!) a consultant.
All you have to do is attach the photo to an email sent tothis address. I won't be able to respond or to read any notes attached, sorry. (Here it is if you have gmail: time10they@photos.flickr.com.)
Fine print: please don't send pictures of dogs, cats or iguanas. No family members, either, we know you can't live without them. No guarantee of inclusion. Close cover before striking. By sending the photo, you acknowledge that you have the right to share it and you're giving me permission to use it. Thanks.

Critics that matter,"If you invent or launch or market (and you're human) it's likely that you have the voice of the critic in the back of your head. It's natural to fear what they'll say, and if you're not careful, you'll end up redesigning your product to please them before you even launch it.
Imagine the restaurant chef who changes the interior of the restaurant to please the Michelin critic (they insist on a certain quality of cutlery in order to award a three star review). It might be your boss who is the critic. Or consider the B2B manufacturer who alters the product specs in order to meet the standards of the GAO so he can sell to the US Government…
Some critics matter. (Your biggest customer, for example). Some are merely loud. Others are just difficult.
Janet Maslin at theNew York Timesis a cranky hack. She reviews popular fiction and non-fiction, and as best I can tell, she likes neither very much. She's taken authors to task for questionable copy editing and devoted entire reviews to pointless rants about trivia. Here's the thing:she doesn't matter.Janet's reviews appear to have no impact at all on whether or not a book sells. Her voice is not in my head.
Robert Morris, on the other hand, is a useful guide for people in search of good books. He's reviewed nearly 2,000 books and received almost 25,000 helpful votes for his reviews on Amazon. If he likes your book, you're going to sell more copies–not because he liked it, but because his thorough review lets other people decide if they want to buy it or not.
The challenge is in figuring out which kind of critic is worth paying attention to as you create your product or service. In a business to business setting, pleasing the gatekeeper and the bill payer is essential. On the other hand, pleasing an angry blogger might not matter at all.
In our desire to please everyone, it's very easy to end up being invisible or mediocre. Far better to please the right people.","August 13, 2009","Critics, Product Development, Audience Insight"
Lessons from very tiny businesses,"1. Go where your customers are.
Jacquelyne runs a tiny juice company calledChakwave. I met her in Los Angeles, standing next to an organic lunchtruck. Like the little birds that clean the teeth of the hippo, there's synergy here. The kind of person that visits the truck for lunch is the sort of person that would happily pay for something as wonderfully weird as her juice. And the truck owners benefit from the rolling festival farmer's market feel that comes from having a synergistic partner set up on a bridge table right next door.
2. Be micro-focused and the search engines will find you.
My friend Patti Jo is an extraordinary teacher and tutor. Her new business,The Scarsdale Tutordoesn't need many clients in order to be successful. This permits her to focus obsessively and that gets rewarded with front page results on Google. Not because she's tried to manipulate the seo (she hasn't) but because this is exactly the page you'd hope to find if you typed ""scarsdale tutor"" into a search engine. Could she do this nationwide? Of course not. But she doesn't want to or need to. Living on the long tail can be profitable.
3. Outlast the competition.
I was amazed at all the empty storefronts I saw in LA on my last visit. On one particular block, three or four of the ten lunch places were shut down. And the others? Doing great. That's because the remaining office workers who used to eat lunch at the shuttered places had to eat somewhere, and so the survivors watched their businessgrow. A war of attrition is never pretty, but if you're smart about overhead and scale, you'll win it.
4. Leverage.
Rick Toone runs a tiny guitar-making operation. His lack of scale makes it easy for him toshare. When others start using his designs, he doesn't suffer (he can't make any more guitars than he already is) he benefits, because as the originator of the design, his originals become more coveted, not less valuable. He leverages his insight and shares it as a free marketing device.
5. Respond.
This is the single biggest advantage you have over the big guys. Not only are you in charge, you also answer the phone and read your email and man the desk and set the prices.
So, don't pretend you have a policy. Just be human.","August 12, 2009","tiny businesses, customer engagement, competition strategies"
The scientific method,"In most interactions, we take a defensive posture. We try to defend thebrand, or our turf or our job. The problem with defense is that it'sstatic. The best way to get smarter, to embrace and to cause change and to triumph in times of market turmoil is to adopt the scientific method.
Ask yourself, ""what do I believe that's wrong? How can I change the way I do things? What works? What doesn't?""
If you enter a conversation looking for something to test, measure and ultimately change, it's likely you'll find it. That change makes you more competitive, and you continue to cycle past your competitors. On the other hand, if you enter a conversation concerned about maintaining the status quo, it's likely that this is exactly what you're going to do.
Some people read business books looking for confirmation. I read them in search of disquiet. Confirmation is cheap, easy and ineffective. Restlessness and the scientific method, on the other hand, create a culture of testing and inquiry that can't help but push you forward.","August 11, 2009","scientific method, change, inquiry"
Who spreads your word?,"In order for an idea to spread, someone has to do the spreading.
In the dark ages (ten years ago), the only way to spread your idea on a large scale was to do it yourself. Lots and lots of ads.
Today, marketers get all sweaty thinking about how this happensmagically, virally, for free. If it were only that easy.
What's interesting to me is that different products and ideas are spread by different groups of people.There isn't just one professional association of idea spreaders, with everyone else being passive.
If your authentic little Welsh restaurant gets hot, it's going to be because the chowhounds, the folks who love to talk about the next great place, are buzzing about it. On the other hand, if your blog gets a lot of traffic, it might just be because a few of the digerati are going on about it, spreading the idea.
This is obvious, of course.
But what you are you doing about it? Have you figured out which portion of your user base are the talkers? Is it possible to focus your development efforts on actually making something that they like? Or, are you confusing the people who talk about your competition or about other industries with the people you need to reach? Might not be the same tribe…
The #1 cause of an idea that's not spreading or a business that's not growing is that they don't have a committed group of people spreading the word about them. If you treat everyone the same, you're not increasing the odds that some people will step up on your behalf.
This is the first question to ask someone who is frustrated at the rate their idea is spreading. ""Who are you hoping will talk about you?"" If you don't know, it's unlikely to happen all by itself. On the other hand, if a marketer is smart about finding, courting and delighting the group most likely to spread the idea, it's time well spent.","August 10, 2009","idea spreading, word of mouth, target audience"
The danger of vague claims,"The sign the broker posted in front of the house listed her name and then said, ""#1 in Westchester, Top 10 Nationwide.""
What does that mean, exactly? That this real estate broker is the most successful broker in the whole county and one of the top ten in the country? I don't think so. Not if she's selling this house. She'd have to sell a thousand houses like this to catch up with someone in a fancier neighborhood who only sells ten.
I think it means that the firm she works for is really big. So what? Is that a qualification for anything? Is the 11th biggest real estate firm way less good than the ninth?

When tactics drown out strategy,"New media creates a blizzard of tactical opportunities for marketers, and many of them cost nothing but time, which means you don't need as much approval and support to launch them.
As a result, marketers are like kids at Rita's candy shoppe, gazing at all the pretty opportunities.
Most of us are afraid of strategy, because we don't feel confident outlining one unless we're sure it's going to work. And the 'work' part is all tactical, so we focus on that. (Tactics are easy to outline, because we say, ""I'm going to post this."" If we post it, we succeed. Strategy is scary to outline, because we describe results, not actions, and that means opportunity for failure.)
""Building a permission asset so we can grow our influence with our best customers over time"" is a strategy. Using email, twitter or RSS along with newsletters, contests and a human voice are all tactics.In my experience, people get obsessed about tactical detail before they embrace a strategy…and as a result, when a tactic fails, they begin to question the strategy that they never really embraced in the first place.
The next time you find yourself spending 8 hours on tactics and five minutes refining your strategy, you'll understand what's going on.","August 7, 2009","strategy, tactics, marketing"
Are we solving the same problem?,"This is the biggest disconnect I know of.
It happens all the time in B2B sales, in service marketing, in getting along with your boss and even in hiring someone.
One side thinks they have figured out a solution. They spend a long time talking about the solution, architecting it, refining it, pricing it, pitching it, delivering it. The other side ends up not liking what they get. The disconnect: the first side says, ""this solution is exactly as we described it!"" the other side says, ""it doesn't work right.""
The disconnect is caused because people focus on the solution instead of the problem you were given to solve. It's a lot easier to talk about features and hours spent and someone's resume and a lot more difficult to dig into the problem itself.
This is where the obligating question becomes so critical. ""If we can deliver a dam that stops the water flow, will you be delighted?"" ""If I can hire someone who can answer ten calls an hour and keep customers coming back, will that work?"" ""If this book cover receives an award for best design, will that be a win?""
The difficult conversation about the problem is far more useful than the endless effort on solutions. The reason is that people don't tell themselves (or you) about the problem they're actually solving. Sure, they'd like an employee that does x, y or z, but you know what, they'd also like that person to be really good looking and willing to do our bidding, waiting on us hand and foot. Sure, we'd like a personal computer with a lot of computing power, but we'd also like it to be light and sexy and covetable…

The bandwidth-sync correlation that’s worth thinking about,"Check this out. Every once in a while a cool graph pops into my head.
Here are a dozen or so forms of communication, arranged on two axes.
On the horizontal, they rank from asynchronous (meaning the creator and the responder are separated in time–like a letter) and synchronous (meaning the creator and the responder are in real time proximity to each other–like a phone call).
Up and down, I've charted the quality of the medium. Quality in terms of density of information exchanged. The 140 characters in Twitter is about as low density as you can get other than a stop light. A movie, on the other hand, is loud and bright and two hours long and there's audience reaction and it is edited and designed to evoke a response.
To be clear, then: movies take a long time to make, but they're high impact. Twitter takes a second to do, but there's not a lot of info there. One on one coaching is high enough bandwidth that it can change your life and make you cry, in real time, and the Mona Lisa, while less bits per second than a TV show, has enough emotional bandwidth to matter, even if it's 400 years old.
So, what can you learn here?

Bear shaving,"Global warming a problem? Just shave the bears.
Let's define ""bear shaving"" as the efforts we go to do deal with the symptoms of a problem instead of addressing the cause of the problem. A rare Japanese PSA (now long lost to the copyright gods) showed a girl shaving a bear so it could deal with global warming (here's a lesserone)…
Example: putting a sophisticated queue management system into the Department of Motor Vehicles so that people waiting in line feel like it's less of a mob. This is bear shaving. The productive approach would be to redefine what actually happens in that building so the line itself disappears.
Example: iPhones come locked so they can't be used with other carriers, so people spend hours and plenty of money to 'unlock' them. That's bear shaving. Better to figure out an easy way to pay AT&T their tribute so they can be truly unlocked…
Example: You have emotional issues associated with eating. You shave the bear by getting bariatric surgery instead of dealing with the issue that caused the problem in the first place.
Example: You have a leaky roof and you shave the bear by buying buckets.

Fidelity vs. Convenience,"Kevin Maney has abookout in September about the trade off between delivering extraordinary experiences (which he calls fidelity) and doing it in a way that's cheap and easy (convenience). The book takes this simple idea and supports it with dozens of examples.
The simplest example is movies. You pay to go to a theatre when you want the fidelity of the big screen and the crowd and the speakers. You stay home when you want the convenience of Netflix and the pause button. Vinyl records and live concerts offer fidelity, MP3 on your iPod is convenient.
In the words of Bill Gross, in order to win with a new product, you need to be on one axis or another, andten times betterthan what you're aiming to replace. Which means ten times more high impact or ten times cheaper and easier.
A refrigerator is ten times more convenient than an icebox. A cell phone is ten times more convenient than a pay phone. A private jet is ten times more joyful/fidelity than first class for the executive that can afford it. A backstage pass at a Cat Power concert is ten times higher fidelity than a ripped MP3.
There are interesting ways to define 'fidelity'. Wikipedia is certainly more convenient, and the presence of a million articles that aren't even in the Brittanica makes it higher fidelity as well. At the start, though, they were neither. It took a (relatively) tiny group of passionate people to create enough content and enough quality that they could be high enough fidelity to be considered an alternative to the printed encyclopedia. It's interesting to watch Luddite teachers refuse to accept it as a source, claiming that convenience shouldn't trump their definition of fidelity…
The mistake that's so easy to make is to be a little bit higher fidelity and a little bit more convenient. Incumbents fall into this trap all the time, assuming that you'll stick with what you've got because they're sorta both. And insurgents almost always fail because as geeky insiders they think that twice the convenience is enough to persuade anyone who cares. Not going to work.","August 1, 2009","Fidelity, Convenience, Trade-off"
There isn’t one bestseller list,"Corey showed me the list of themost popular Wikipedia articles.
It's insane. It makes no sense. It has rock stars, dead dictators and body parts on it.
Huh? If you look at the top music of December, 1971, they're all songs you probably like. Pop music appeals to the masses, and the bestseller list was a fairly accurate indicator of what we were humming. All of us.
The way to understand lists that aren't vintage pop music is this:it isn't one list.It's four or five, mushed together. You have the list of rock acts, overlaid with the list of comic book heroes, etc. There isn't one person (at least I hope not) who's interested in all of these articles.
Seen like that, you can understand it. Sure, Batman gets seen more than the Green Lantern. Sure, Michael Jackson got seen more than ? and the Mysterians. And when you combine the lists, you get a mash.
Brands fall into the trap of combining market desires all the time.

If Craigslist cost $1,"Some things are better when they're not free.
If Craigslist charged a dollar for every listing, what would happen?
Well, the number of bogus listings and repetitive listings would plummet, making the site far easier to use.
The number of scam artists using the site would go down, because it's more difficult to be anonymous when money changes hands.
The revenue of the site would soar, which means that the people running the site could get (far) richer, or fund digital journalism or change the economy of an emerging nation.
Money creates a sort of friction. In the digital economy, magical things can happen when there is no friction. You can scale to infinity. On the other hand, sometimes youwantfriction.

The problem with the transom,"It's not difficult to throw something over the transom. That's not the problem.
The problem is it's a waste.
The internet has made it so easy to wrap your idea/proposal around a brick and throw it that we forget sometimes that just because you can, it doesn't mean you should.
What sort of proposal should you write to be sure that someone who gets it over the transom will read it? You shouldn't.
Instead, spend the time earning the right to make the proposal. Spend the time building a presence that gets you an invitation, or, at the very least, earns you the credibility to walk in the front door. If you want to pitch a great business development idea to a big company you don't already work with, allocate three to six months of focused, patient effort to earn the right to make the presentation in the first place.
AND! If you are an organization that has a transom, how can you make it easier for great ideas to arrive? How about publishing your org chart so people can find the right person to contact? How about publishing a list of others you've worked with and what you've done with them so others can see what you're interested in? How about appointing someone (an agency? a bureau? an individual?) to act as a filter for you so you're not randomly fishing through the slush pile now and then?

Do marketers have assets?,"I gave a talk the other day, and at the end a woman sheepishly asked, ""when you talk about an asset, what do you mean?""
It's a fair question.
For a marketer, an asset is a tool or a platform, something you can use over and over without using it up. In fact, it's something that gets better the more you invest.
Running an ad is an expense. Building a brand people trust is an asset.
Buying a trade show booth is an expense. Having a permission marketing list of people who want to get anticipated, personal and relevant emails from you is an asset.
What are Amazon's assets? Well, they have a few warehouses and some fancy software, but they primarily have two: a brand that people trust, and a one-click shopping relationship with 50 million people. On top of that, they have an archive of information about those people, what they like and what they don't, that makes it hard for someone to switch to another store easily. All those assets together comprise most of what Amazon has built over the last decade or two.
If you're an unknown freelancer, you don't have much in the way of marketing assets. If you're Harley Davidson, you've got plenty.
The challenge in growing a business is in building assets daily, and doing it for less money than those assets end up being worth. Your expenses should generate assets.","September 26, 2009","Marketing assets, brand trust, business growth"
Adjusting as we go,"Two days ago, I posted aboutBrands in Public.
The response from the brands we've shared it with has been terrific, but other people didn't like elements of it. And they were direct in letting me know.
The goal of the program is to invite brands into the conversation that's already going on around the web, to make it easy for them to do it on their terms. I talked with a brand manager yesterday who explained that this is exactly what he's been trying to do for his company, but the corporate website systems make that difficult for him. We want to open the door and to permit large brands a way to get started without having to roll their own solution.
One way we tried to encourage that was to build 200 sample pages, pages brands could adopt. Alas, some people felt that this was inappropriate, so we've recalibrated and we'll take those pages down before the end of the day.
When a brand wants a page, we'll build it, they'll run it and we'll both have achieved our goals.
Part of the magic of the web is that you can adjust as you go, particularly if you're willing to listen.
I apologize if anyone was confused by my original post, and we're looking forward to having major brands and non-profits using this tool the way we intended–to join in to the conversation that's already happening all around us.

Cultural Wisdom,"It's very easy to underrate the value of cultural wisdom, otherwise known as sophistication.
Walk into a doctor's office and the paneling is wrong, the carpeting is wrong and it feels dated. Instant lack of trust.
Meet a salesperson in your office. She doesn't shake hands, she's fumbling with an old Filofax, she mispronounces Steve Jobs' name and doesn't make eye contact.
Visit a website for a vendor and it looks like one of those long-letter opportunity seeker type sites.
In each case, the reason you wrote someone off had nothing to do with their product and everything to do with their lack of cultural wisdom.
We place a high value on sophistication, because we've been trained to seek it out as a cue for what lies ahead. We figure that if someone is too clueless to understand our norms, they probably don't understand how to make us a product or service that we'll like.
This is even more interesting because different cultures have different norms, so there isn't one right answer. It's an ever changing, complex task. Cultural wisdom is important precisely because it's difficult.
And yet…
Who's in charge of cultural norms at your organization? Does someone hire or train or review to make sure you and your people are getting it right? At Vogue magazine, of course, that's all they do. If they lost it, even for a minute, they'd be toast.
It's funny that we assume that all sorts of complex but ultimately unimportant elements need experts and committees and review, but the most important element of marketing–demonstrating cultural wisdom–shouldn't even be discussed.",,"Cultural Wisdom, Sophistication, Marketing"
The platform vs. the eyeballs,"This might be the most subtle yet important shift that marketers face as they deal with the reality of new media. Marketers aren't renters, now they own.
For generations, marketers were trained to buy (actually rent) eyeballs.
A media company assembled a large amount of attention. A TV network or a magazine or even a billboard company found a place you can put an ad, and they sold you a shot at reaching their audience.
You, the marketer, don't care about the long-term value of this audience. It's like a rental car. You want it to be clean and shiny when you get it, you want to avoid getting in trouble when you return it, but hey, it's a rental.
And so when we buy ads, we ask, ""how big an audience"" and then we design an ad with our brand in mind, not with the well-being of the media company or its audience in mind. And if we get a .1% or even a 1% response rate, we celebrate.
A trade show booth is an example of eyeball thinking. The trade show organizer assembles attendees and your job at the booth is to grab as many as you can.
Old media was not the same as old branding. Media companies built audiences and then brands rented those audiences.
Suddenly the new media comes along and the rules are different. You're not renting an audience, you're building one. You're not exhibiting at a trade show, you're starting your own trade show.
If you still ask, ""how much traffic is there,"" or ""what's the CPM?"" you're not getting it. Are you buying momentary attention or are you investing in a long term asset?
Now, when you buy something (that thing you used to call 'media'), you're not paying for eyeballs, you're paying for a platform. A platform you can use to build your own audience, one that you can nurture, educate and ultimately convert. You'll take care of this audience differently, measure them differently and have a different sales cycle. This isn't natural, but it works.
Two steps: buy a platform and then fill it with people. Some examples:
Authors have traditionally relied on publishers to bring them readers. The author gives up the majority of the income and the publisher brings them the readers. But then you see someone like Frank atPost Secretwho builds his own audience for his (sometimes nsfw) content. He owns a platform, it's not something he rents. Now, using a publisher is a choice, not a necessity. Just about every successful author going forward (except for the lucky exceptions like Dan Brown) will own her own media channel. Not just authors, of course…
Consider the local real estate agent. She can spend to run ads every week in the local paper, or she can use the same money to start a legitimate media channel, a digital magazine, say, one that cheers on the school and gives the local paper a run for its money. And oh yes, the only houses listed for sale are hers. It might take a lot of work and even some money. But what does she get? A platform forever.
Traditionally, a clothing brand has to give up income and control to a retailer, since the retailer has the eyeballs. The web allows a brand likeLittle Miss Matchedto build their own platform, their own audience and thus bypass all those gatekeepers. They invested in a product that told a story instead of investing in giving Walmart a cut. Boring products can't do this.
Or consider the local chiropractor. He can spend money on a yellow pages ad or he can invest in a platform, creating a local running club and doing coaching for its members.
(Compare these examples with McDonald's, a company that continues to rent eyeballs for a high price and has no real platform to speak of.)
Or consider the acquisition of Omniture by Adobe. What did Adobe pay for? I'd argue it was direct access to the right people at the leading advertisers and websites around the world. Technology isn't so hard to copy. Permission to connect is almost impossible to achieve.
Compared to the cost of renting eyeballs, buying a platform is cheap. Filling it with people eager to hear from you… that's the expensive part. But if you don't invest in the platform, you'll be at a disadvantage, now and forever. The smart way to build a brand today is to invest in the elements of the platform… the product, the technology, the websites (plural) and the systems you need to make it easy for people to show up at your very own trade show.

Everyone gets paid on commission,"The Washington Post recently laid off a columnist because his blog posts didn't get enough web traffic.
Of course, in the old days, the newspaper had no real way to tell which columns got read and which ones didn't. So journalists were lulled into the sense that it didn't really matter. The TimesquotesJay Rosen, a journalism professor at NYU,  “It’s an unusual public rationale for serious newspaper people, that’s for sure.”
Wrong tense. It's not going to be unusual for long.
In fact, in a digital world where everything can be measured, we all work on commission. And why not? If you do great work and it works, you should get rewarded. And if you don't, it's hard to see why a rational organization would keep you on.
You don't have to like the coming era of hyper-measurement, but that doesn't mean it's not here.","September 23, 2009","commission, hyper-measurement, journalism"
Launching Brands in Public,"I was talking with a senior marketer at one of the most famous brands in the world last week. She said, ""executives keep coming to me with stuff they find on the internet, stuff they find on YouTube about us, and say, 'take it down!' Of course, I have to explain that I can't take it down. No one can.""
If your brand has any traction at all, people are talking about you. Of course, they've always talked about you, but now they're doing it in writing, in video and in public.
Today, Squidoo (a company I founded) is launching Brands in Public. It's a neat idea and I wanted to give you an overview and a first look.
You can't control what people are saying about you.What you can do isorganizethat speech. You can organize it by highlighting the good stuff and rationally responding to the not-so-good stuff. You can organize it by embracing the people who love your brand and challenging them to speak up and share the good word. And you can respond to it in a thoughtful way, leaving a trail that stands up over time.
But how?
Over the last few months, we've seen big brands (like Amazon and Maytag) get caught in a twitterstorm. An idea (one that's negative to the brand) starts and spreads, and absent a response, it just spirals. Of course, Amazon can't respond on their home page (they're busy running a store) and they don't have an active corporate blog that I could find, so where? How?
EnterBrands In Public.
[see update at the bottom] Squidoo has built several hundred pages, each one about a major brand. More are on the way. We'll keep going until we have thousands of important brands, each on its own page (and we'll happily add one for you if you like). Each page collects tweets, blog posts, news stories, images, videos and comments about a brand. All of these feeds are algorithmic… the good and the bad show up, all collated and easy to find.
Of course, these comments and conversations are already going on, all over the web. What we've done is bring them together in one place. And then we've made it easy for the brand to chime in.
If your brand wants to be in charge of developing this page, it will cost you $400 a month. And once [we build] the page, the left hand column belongs to you. You can post responses, highlight blog posts, run contests or quizzes. You can publicly have your say right next to the constant stream of information about your brand (information that's currently all over the web–and information you can't ""take down"" or censor). You can respond, lead and organize. If a crisis hits, your page will be there, ready for you to speak up. If your fans are delighted, your page makes it easy for them to chime in and speak up on sites around the web.
If you have the tools and wherewithal to build a page like this on your own site, you should consider that. The challenge is getting it done, regardless of where the page lives.
There are already monitoring tools online (likeRadian6) that allow big brands to watch from behind the scenes. That's great, but what are you doing infrontof your audience? Is there a low-cost, easy way to let one of your non-technical marketing people lead and engage with people who are already in the conversation?
We have beta-testers likeAllstateandMolsonandHome Depotthat see the value of showing up where the conversation is happening. My guess is that other significant brands will discover that they can't just rely on a static home page, nor is it sufficient to post an ephemeral response in a feed somewhere. Brands in Public isn't the first, nor will it be the last place brands need to be to coordinate and organize the conversation. People (your customers) will find these pages, point to them, link to them and talk about them, creating a new circle of interest online. If you know a brand that needs to hear about this, there's a short ebook (download) about the project.
It's worth saying that we care a lot about keeping this simple for your organization.  A Brands in Public page for your brand requires no development team, no ad buys and no deep pockets. While you control the left-hand column and can pepper it with good stuff, it's still part of a larger site, not ""your"" page. That means that the number of meetings you need to go to for approvals and permissions is going to decrease. It means that it's not behind your firewall and not something that has to fit into the larger über-corporate strategy. More like a tradeshow and less like your home page. It's in public. It's simply a place for your brand to see and be seen, to organize and to respond.
I'm guessing that big brands are going to need to be in dozens of places like this going forward, because media has shifted from top down, ""here's what we say, we're putting on a show, watch us!"" to, ""oh, you're here, you're talking, hi.""
The first 100 brands that sign up will benefit from a share of the $500,000 in house ads Squidoo will run across the site promoting the service and the first partnering brands. Sales are handled by BzzAgent, so you'll be in good hands–please give them a call if you have any questions about the service. If you've got a brand that people are talking about, I hopeyou'll give it a try.
[UPDATE: We're now offering free pages to chosen charities. If your non-profit organization is interested, please fill out thisform. We'll choose a bunch each month, set them up and then the page belongs to you.]
[UPDATE: Our intent in building sample pages and letting brands seethem in action was misunderstood by many people, and I can understandwhy. As a result, to clear the air, we're going to be taking these 200sample pages down today. The only pages that we'll be posting are thosefrom our sponsors, we won't be building any others. Thanks to thosethat let me know about their concerns, and I'm sorry for the confusion.]","September 23, 2009","Brands in Public, brand management, social media response"
"Win the fight, lose the customer","Does it really matter if you're right?
Given the choice between acknowledging that your customer is upset or proving to her that she is wrong, which will you choose?
You can be right or you can have empathy.
You can't do both.
It's not the nature of capitalism to need to teach people a lesson, it's the nature of being a human, we just blame it on capitalism. In fact, smart marketers understand that the word 'right' in ""The customer is always right"" doesn't mean that they'd win in court or a debate. It means, ""If you want the customer to remain a customer, you need to permit him to believe he's right.""
If someone thinks they're unhappy, then you know what? They are.
Trying say this to yourself:I have no problem acknowledging that you're unhappy, upset or even angry. Next time, I'd prefer to organize our interaction so you don't end up feeling that way, and I probably could have done it this time, too. You have my attention and my empathy and I value you. Thanks for being here.
If you can't be happy with that, then sure, go ahead and fire the customer, cause they're going to leave anyway.","September 22, 2009","empathy, customer service, conflict resolution"
Understanding business development,"Business Developmentis a mysterious title for a little discussed function or department in most larger companies. It’s also a great way for an entrepreneur or small business to have fun, create value and make money.
Good business development allows businesses to profit by doing something that is tangential to their core mission. Sometimes the profit is so good, it becomes part of their core mission, other times it supports the brand and sometimes it just makes money. And often it’s a little guy who can be flexible enough to make things happen.
Examples:
You don’t see business development from the outside, particularly all the potential deals that fail along the way. Many companies, though, spend millions of dollars a year looking for deals and then discovering that they pay off many times over. Others, particularly smaller competitors, are so focused on their core business that it never occurs to them to consider partnerships, licensing, publishing, acquisition and other arrangements that might change everything. Harley Davidson probably makes more money on business development than they make on motorcycles.
The thing that makes business development fascinating is thatthe best deals have never been done before.There’s no template, no cookie cutter grind it out approach to making it work. This is why most organizations are so astonishingly bad at it. They don’t have the confidence to make decisions or believe they have the ability to make mistakes.
Think about theApple Nikepartnership on making a device that integrates your iPod with your sneakers. This took years and cost millions of dollars to develop. Most companies would just flee, giving up long before a deal was done and a product was shipped.
Here are some tactical tips on how to do business development better:","September 21, 2009","Business Development, Partnerships, Entrepreneurship"
If TV ads were free,"If ads had been free, then the way people would have learned how to do TV advertising would have been by running ads. If they were free, why not? Why talk about it if you could do it? Why guess what would work if you could actually find out for yourself? Running ads would have been cheaper than focus groups. But ads weren't free in 1964, so people talked and pontificated instead of actually running every ad they came up with.
You guessed it: new media is largely free. So why teach it in school as if it were a scary theory? Why encourage people to be afraid? Just do it. Build your own platform. Appear in the places that seem productive or interesting or challenging or fun. Experiment quietly, figure out what works, do it more. No need to be a dilettante, and certainly you shouldn't spread yourself too thin or quit at the first sign of failure… but… quit waiting for the right answer.

The priority list,"What should you do next?
Is it better to email an existing customer, send a brochure to a prospect or improve your product a bit? Should you tweet or post a new blog post? Should you have a meeting to coordinate your team or spend ten minutes returning phone calls instead?
This is an unheralded skill, something successful people do really well and others struggle with.
How do you decide what to do next?
One of the challenges we have in reducing carbon emissions is that (as far as I know) there's no priority list. Which is worse: leaving your computer on all night or not having the windows weatherstripped? Which is worse: driving a car to Boston or going by plane with 200 other people? Is it worth driving across town to buy a pint of organic strawberries or should I get the ones from the nearby store that came from California? If you have a thousand dollars to invest in making a reduction in greenhouse gasses, should you buy new tires, switch to local foods or perhaps send $900 to help a factory in China switch away from coal and then use the other hundred to have a massage?
Without a list, you can see how making intelligent decisions is impossible, so we resort to confusing activity with productivity.
Back to your office: do you have a list? Have you figured out which metric you're trying to improve? Can you measure the impact of the choices you make all day?
I see this mistake in business development all the time. Assume for a moment that the goal of someone in this department is to maximize profit. Why then would this group spend most of its time tweaking existing deals (looking for a 3% improvement in yield) instead of spending the same time and effort doing new, game-changing deals?","September 19, 2009","Prioritization, Decision-making, Business Development"
Things to ask before you redo your website,"I don't do any consulting, but that doesn't stop people from asking me questions. The most common question people ask me when they want a new website is, ""If you were in charge of this, who are the 2 or 3 people you’d want to be sure to talk to – to help think through the issues, help us figure out who should do the work, etc.?""
The second most common question people ask me,  ""In addition to Apple’s site, are there 2 or 3 that you think are really appealing and work well for their business?""
I think these are perhaps the tenth and eleventh questions you should ask, not the first two. Here's my list of difficult and important questions you have to answer before you spend a nickel:

Chai Wallah,"It's so tempting to do a little bit of everything. All the tools are there, a click away. You can be the designer, the copywriter, the head of customer service. Hey, you can even do the manufacturing or easily outsource it to a commodity producer. One benefit of diversification is that you can average out your risk.
Or you can be a wallah. Someone who does only that one thing.
An old colleague of mine calls himself achai wallah. Perhaps he loves spiced tea, but I'd prefer to believe it's a reminder that his success lives and dies on the performance of just one task.

Friction,"Stamps (remember those?) make direct mail work. Because it costs money to send a piece of junk mail, you'll think two or three times before you mail something to a million people.
Email, of course, is free.
Except it's not. The friction that slows down sending email to everyone all the time is the cost of all the people you'll lose. You might lose them because they unsubscribe, or more likely, you'll train them to ignore you. Worse still, you might just make them annoyed enough to badmouth you.
Drugstore.com made two mistakes with their relationship with me. First, they bought the lie that opt out is a productive strategy. They unilaterally decided that I'd be delighted to get regular emails from them, merely because I bought some shaving cream.
The second mistake? They didn't bother to be selective about what they sent.
I've never purchased diapers online, since my diaper purchases predate online diaper shopping. And my hope is that I won't be buying Depends for another fifty years or so. Drugstore.com should know this. And yet, because it's apparently free to email me, some lame brand manager says, ""sure, do it!""
Except then I unsubscribe and an asset that is worth ten or a hundred or a thousand dollars disappears, probably forever.

The problem with non,"Non as innon-profit.
The first issue is the way you describe yourself. I know what you’renotbut what are you?
Did you start or join this non-profit because of the non part? I doubt it. It's because you want to make change. The way the world is just isn't right or good enough for you… there's an emergency or an injustice or an opportunity and you want to make change.
These organizations exist solely to make change. That's why you joined, isn't it?
The problem facing your group, ironically, is the resistance to the very thing you are setting out to do. Non-profits, in my experience, abhor change.
Take a look at thetop 100twitter users in terms of followers. Remember, this is a free tool, one that people use to focus attention and galvanize action. What?Noneof them are non-profits. Not one as far as I can tell. Is the work you're doing not important enough to follow, or is it (and I'm betting it is) paralysis in decision making in the face of change? Is there too much bureaucracy or too much fear to tell a compelling story in a transparent way?
Beth has a greatpostabout the feeling of vertigo that non-profits get when they move from the firm ground of the tried and true to the anti-gravity that comes from leaping into change.
Where are the big charities, the urgent charities, the famous charities that face such timely needs and are in a hurry to make change? Very few of them have bothered to show up in a big way. The problem is same as the twitter resistance: The internet represents a change. It's easy to buy more stamps and do moredirect mail, scary to use a new technique.
Of course, some folks, likecharity: waterare stepping into the void and raising millions of dollars as a result. They're not necessarily a better cause, they're just more passionate about making change.
A few years ago I met with two (very famous) non-profits to discuss permission marketing and online fundraising and how they might have an impact. Each time, the president of the group was in the room. After about forty five minutes, the meetings devolved into endless lists of why any change at all in the way things were was absolutely impossible. Everyone looked to the president of the group for leadership, and when he didn't say anything, they dissembled, stalled and evaded. Every barrier was insurmountable, every element of the status quo was cast in stone.  The president of the group was (he thought) helpless.
When was the last time you had an interaction with a non-profit (there's that word again) that blew you away?
Please don't tell me it's about a lack of resources. The opportunities online are basically free, and if you don't have a ton of volunteers happy to help you, then you're not working on something important enough. The only reason not to turn this over to hordes of crowds eager to help you is that it means giving up total control and bureaucracy. Which is scary because it leads to change.
If you spend any time reading marketing blogs, you'll find thousands of case studies of small (and large)  innovative businesses that are shaking things up and making things happen. And not enough of these stories are about non-profits.If your non-profit isn't acting with as much energy and guts as it takes to get funded in Silicon Valley or featured on Digg, then you're failing in your duty to make change.
The marketing world has changed completely. So has the environment for philanthropic giving. So have the attitudes of a new generation of philanthropists. But if you look at the biggest charities in the country, you couldn't tell. Because they're 'non' first, change second.
Sorry if I sound upset, but I am. The work these groups do is too important (and the people who work for them are too talented) to waste this opportunity because you are paralyzed in fear.","September 15, 2009","non-profit, change, resistance"
The hierarchy of success,"I think it looks like this:
We spend all our time on execution. Usethisword instead ofthatone. This web host. That color. This material or that frequency of mailing.
Big news: No one ever succeeded because of execution tactics learned from aDummiesbook.
Tactics tell you what to execute. They're important, but dwarfed by strategy. Strategy determines which tactics might work.
But what's the point of a strategy if your goals aren't clear, or contradict?
Which leads the first two, the two we almost never hear about.
Approach determines how you look at the project (or your career). Do you read a lot of books? Ask a lot of questions? Use science and testing or go with your hunches? Are you imperious? A lifehacker? When was the last time you admitted an error and made a dramatic course correction? Most everyone has a style, and if you pick the wrong one, then all the strategy, tactics and execution in the world won't work nearly as well.
As far as I'm concerned, the most important of all, the top of the hierarchy is attitude. Why are you doing this at all? What's your bias in dealing with people and problems?
Some more questions:
Sure, you can start at the bottom by focusing on execution and credentials. Reading a typical blog (or going to a typical school for 16 years), it seems like that's what you're supposed to do. What a waste.
Isn't it odd that these six questions are so important and yet we almost never talk or write about them?
If the top of the hierarchy is messed up, no amount of brilliant tactics or execution is going to help you at all.","September 14, 2009","success hierarchy, strategy, attitude"
The end of dumb software,"In the age of rapid cycles and connected data, how long are we going to have to settle for dumb software?
Here's the detail screen from iCal. If I write a long text to go with an appointment, the only way to see the whole thing is to hit ""edit.""  But I don't want to edit it, I just want to see it.
If I try to schedule an appointment for 2 pm, it requires me to not only hit the 2, but also select pm. I have never once had a meeting at 2 am. Shouldn't it know that?
When I type in someone's name, how come it doesn't know that this is someone I know, correspond with and meet with often? Why isn't it connected?
I have tens of thousands of people in my address book. Some of these folks were put there ten years ago and, alas, are dead or long gone. Do I really have to go through and delete people manually? Why isn't my address book smart enough to sort the list in reverse order of use, so I can see records I haven't encountered in seven years first and start from there? Or, better, why doesn't this address book hook up with other address books of trusted peers and automatically correct and update?
The people who make desktop software are making themselves obsolete. When you start developing on the web, your default is to be smart, to interact and to be open (with other software and with your users).

Flipping abundance and scarcity,"I think it's dangerous and often fatal to put free on top of an existing business model. Things fall apart.
People look at the free revolution and say, ""oh, that could never work. If I gave x, y or z away for free, I'd fail."" They're right. They will fail…If they keep the model the same and just give away stuff for free.
The way you win is by reinventing the model itself. So, for example,lululemondoing giant free yoga classes in New York. The more people come, the more clothes they'll sell… it'll become a movement. Or Crossfit, publishing their insane work outs online. The more people do them, the better the scarce part (private coaching, etc.) does.
We spent a generation believing certain parts of our business needed to be scarce and that advertising and other interruption should be abundant. Part of the pitch of free is that when advertising goes away, you need to make something else abundant in order to gain attention. Then, and only then, will you be able to sell something that's naturally scarce.
This is an uncomfortable flip to make, because the stuff you've been charging for feels like it should be charged for, and the new scarcity is often difficult to find. But, especially in the digital world, this is happening, and faster than ever.","September 12, 2009","business model, abundance, scarcity"
Taking the time to teach,"What we do in the long run, over time, drip by drip, affects the market so much more than an angry reaction or urgent event.
Smoking a pack a day for twenty years is a great way to be sure you'll die early. Far more likely, in fact, than getting hit by a car. And yet it's so easy to talk to our kids about cars…
Delivering out of the box remarkability day after day counts for far more than one hit or one misstep. When we teach people about our story or our industry or about making connections, the teaching lasts.
Teaching people not only impacts the market, it changes the world. Teaching about connection and community and science, a little bit at a time, can heal our world in the long run. It doesn't happen as fast as we might like, but it works. Emergencies fade, and in the long run our teaching lasts.

The big drop off,"We try so hard to build the first circle.
This is the circle of followers, friends, subscribers, customers, media outlets and others willing to hear our pitch. This is the group we tell about our new product, our new record, our upcoming big sale. We want more of their attention and more people on the list.
Which takes our attention away from the circle that matters, which is the second circle.
The second circle are the people who hear about us from the first circle.
If the first circle is excited about what we do and it's remarkable enough to talk about, they'll tell two or six or ten friends each. And if we're really good, the second circle, the people we don't even know–they'll tell the third circle. And it's the third circle that makes you a hit, gets you elected and tips your idea.
The big drop off is the natural state of affairs. The big drop off is the huge decline that occurs between our enthusiasm (HEY! BUY THIS!) and the tepid actions of the first circle (yawn). Great marketers don't spend their time making the first circle bigger. They spend all their time crafting services, products and stories that don't drop off.","September 10, 2009","circles, marketing, audience"
Righteous indignation,"This is a default response for many people–irked customers, angry bosses, disappointed colleagues. It's easy to go into high dudgeon (in fact, low dudgeon isn't even in the dictionary, it's always 'high').
The thing is: it doesn't work. It rarely succeeds in accomplishing much, and it makes you unhappy at the same time.
What if you took it out of your toolbox of responses?
What if, just like becoming a cannibal or painting your face green, you eliminated righteous indignation as an option in your list of responses to various situations, no matter how unfair?

Clout,"The web knows something, but it's not telling us, at least not yet.
The web knows how many followers you have on Twitter, how many friends you have on Facebook, how many people read your blog.
It also knows how often those people retweet, amplify and spread your ideas.
It also knows how many followers your followers have…
So, what if, Google-style, someone took all this data and figured out who has clout. Which of your readers is the one capable of making an idea break through the noise and spread? Bloggers don't have impact because they have a lot of readers, they have a lot of impact because of who their readers are (my readers, of course, are the most sophisticated and cloutful on the entire web).
If you knew which of your followers had clout, you could invest more time and energy in personal attention. If we knew where big ideas were starting, that would be neat, and even more useful would be understanding who the key people were in bringing those new ideas to the rest of the world.
Back in the old days, we had no idea, so we defaulted to big newspapers, or magazines or the TV networks. But now we know. We just need to surface the data in a way that is useful.","September 7, 2009","Clout, Influence, Data Analysis"
Pay for stuff,"As a bootstrapping entrepreneur, my instinct has always been to work before spend. If there was a way to spread the word virally instead of buying ads, I would. If there was a way to change the project so I could do it myself, I would. If I could trade or whittle my way into getting an asset on the come, I would. That's the mantra of the bootstrapper.
It turns out that paying for stuff works too.
Ads that pay for themselves are worth buying. Employees and freelancers that produce more than they cost are worth hiring. Office rents that generate productivity, foot traffic or revenue are probably worth paying.
In the free media world in which we're living now, it's so easy to get stuck on not investing, on avoiding outlays at all cost. Frugal is an admirable trait, but being a miser is dumb.","September 6, 2009","bootstrapping, investment, productivity"
Square one is underrated,"Perhaps the worst outcome most people can imagine when a project stutters is having to go, ""all the way back to square one.""
Apparently, square one is an unhappy place, and far away, too.
Hey, if you're lost, if you've gone down the wrong road, it doesn't make sense to speed up and keep racing down the wrong road. Instead, the smart thing is to go back to the last spot you were in where you had a chance to find the right road and start from there.

The problem with positive thinking,"All the evidence I've seen shows that positive thinking and confidence improves performance. In anything.
Give someone an easy math problem, watch them get it right and then they'll do better on the ensuing standardized test than someone who just failed a difficult practice test.
No, positive thinking doesn't allow you to do anything, but it's been shown over and over again that it improves performance over negative thinking.
Key question then: why do smart people engage in negative thinking? Are they actually stupid?
The reason, I think, is that negative thinking feels good. In its own way, we believe that negative thinking works. Negative thinking feels realistic, or soothes our pain, or eases our embarrassment. Negative thinking protects us and lowers expectations.
In many ways, negative thinking is a lot more fun than positive thinking. So we do it.
If positive thinking was easy, we'd do it all the time. Compounding this difficulty is our belief that the easy thing (negative thinking) is actually appropriate, it actually works for us. The data is irrelevant. We're the exception, so we say.

Organizing customers,"The local youth theatre troupe recently put on a performance ofGrease. It was a high-spirited outing, with terrific performances and it was a great way for them to spend a month or two over the summer. I was amazed to discover, though, that the budget for the rights to the play were $3,000. That's pretty steep for a high school production of an old, not particularly wonderful musical script that was only going to be seen by the local community. Should it really cost $7 for every person who watches the play?
The reason fees for licensing plays are so high is that almost all plays and musicals are licensed by just a few firms and the purchasers have no power whatsoever. The sellers have signalled each other and created an artificially high pricing floor. ""Take it or leave it"" is their motto.
Here's the opportunity that the net provides (in this case and so many others): someone should organize thecustomersand negotiate on their behalf.
Imagine contacting 3,000 high schools and finding 500 willing to join together and agree to act as a buying cartel. Now, the organizer can poll the directors at these schools and find thirty plays they'd be willing to put on next year. Go to the rights holders of these plays and say, ""We're going to pick six of these plays. Each of the six will get a huge number of customers as a result, perhaps twenty times as many as you usually get. But to be among the six, you need to lower your price by a factor of ten.""
Now, if you're the rights holder, you have a dilemma (but not a huge one). You can agree to lower your price and thus double your annual revenue on this dusty old play, or you can stay where you are and make zero.
Hmmmm.
Over time, the cartel will only grow more powerful. Word of mouth will spread, because news that joining this cartel cuts the cost of renting a play or musical by 90% is noteworthy. More will join. The benefits to the rights holders who agree to play along will go up because they'll have the play reach more audiences. The only losers will be those that are stuck on the old model of taking advantage of independent communities with no purchasing power.
While this has been tried in markets where it's very difficult to make it work (like consumer electronics where the margins are small) I think it can thrive in business to business, service and intellectual property markets where market share can easily make up for lowered profits. Universities can join up to push down the price of textbooks by agreeing to adopt the one of the six acceptable ones that's the cheapest–and all the others get zero. The key is frequent communication and solidarity as you go through the dip that will happen when providers resist your initial offers. That's why the net (and free online coordination and messaging) are so critical.
Think of all the tiny vertical markets where this can really pay off.
And of course, the organizer deserves (and gets) a piece of the savings.",,"Organizing customers, licensing fees, buying cartel"
Enormity,"Enormity doesn't meanreally enormous.It meansincredibly horrible.The problem with enormity in marketing is that it doesn't work. Enormity should pull at our heartstrings, but it usually shuts us down.
Show us too many sick kids, unfair imprisonments or burned bodies and you won't get a bigger donation, you'll just get averted eyes.
If you've got a small, fixable problem, people will rush to help, because people like to be on the winning side, take credit and do something that worked.

"Magic beans, TV and the web","New media isn't the perfect marketing medium, and it won't be until we find the magic beans.
TV had magic beans for forty years. For forty years, anyone, even a complete moron, could make a lot of money using TV ads. Buy enough ads, don't screw up, you're rich.
The hard part was buying enough ads, but once you did that, victory could be declared.
On the web, there are countless marketers just standing around waiting for someone to hand them the magic beans. And that's the problem.
Marketing online takes too much measurement, patience, creativity, technical knowledge, flexibility, speed and authenticity. It requires too much thinking and not enough going out for dinner with clients.
Perhaps there will never be magic beans again. Perhaps marketing is about to transition to a new kind of profession, one that requires insight, dedication and smarts.
Or maybe someone will find some magic beans.","September 1, 2009","marketing, new media, creativity"
Why celebrate Halloween?,"Because everyone else does.
Why believe that people once put razor blades into apples and you should only eat wrapped candies? Because everyone else believes it (it's an urban legend).
Most of what we believe is not a result of direct experience (ever seen an electron?) but is rather part of our collection of truth because everyone (or at least the people we respect) around us seems to believe it as well.
We not only believe that some brands are better than others, we believe in social constructs, no shirt, no shoes, no service. We believe things about changing our names when we get married or what's an appropriate gift for a baby shower.
This groupthink is the soil that marketing grows in. It's frustrating for someone who is hyper-fact-based or launching a new brand to come to the conclusion that people believe what they believe, not that people are fact-centered data processing organisms.
Sure, it would be great to have an organization that enjoys the advantage ofeveryonebelieving. Getting from here, to there, though, requires stories, emotion and ideas that spread.

Opt in and opt out,"Every year, tens of thousands of people die because organ donor status in the US is opt in. If you want to be an organ donor when you're dead, you need to go through steps now to opt in. The default is ""no.""
Press releases, sent by the billions, seem to have become opt out. If you don't want the barrage of nonsense, PR firms appear to believe that one by one you must alert each and every publicist in the world of your desire to not hear from them.
401 (k) plans tend to be opt in. If you do nothing, you get nothing.
Talking to the police after getting arrested is strictly opt out. Nothing to sign, you just talk.
Cheese on your pasta used to be opt out, but now it appears to be becoming opt in.
Bacon should never be opt out. Sorry, but that's just the way I feel.
I think there are a few general principles that could save us time and money and hassle:
So, I'd make organ donation opt out, public religious observance opt in, newsletters opt in and smart financial choices opt out. Anything that tricks a consumer into paying for something ought to be double opt in. And without a doubt, email (and commercial transactions of all kinds) are opt in. Smart for both sides.

"Dunbar’s Number isn’t just a number, it’s the law","Dunbar's number is 150.
And he's not compromising, no matter how much you whine about it.
Dunbar postulated that the typical human being can only have 150 friends. One hundred fifty people in the tribe. After that, we just aren't cognitively organized to handle and track new people easily. That's why, without external forces, human tribes tend to split in two after they reach this size. It's why WL Gore limits the size of their offices to 150 (when they grow, they build a whole new building).
Facebook and Twitter and blogs fly in the face of Dunbar's number. They put hundreds or thousands of friendlies in front of us, people we would have lost touch with (why? because of Dunbar!) except that they keep digitally reappearing.
Reunions are a great example of Dunbar's number at work. You might like a dozen people you meet at that reunion, but you can't keep up, because you're full.
Some people online are trying to flout Dunbar's number, to become connected and actual friends with tens of thousands of people at once. And guess what? It doesn't scale. You might be able to stretch to 200 or 400, but no, you can't effectively engage at a tribal level with a thousand people. You get the politician's glassy-eyed gaze or the celebrity's empty stare.

What's the point of agreeing to anything begrudgingly? Does it get your partner to do his best work? Does it increase the chances that you'll get to win next time?
If you're going to do something, do it. Go all in. Doing it half in makes no sense at all to me.

The joy of quitting,"The governor of New York faces an interesting choice.
He can do the natural thing, the thing with momentum, the thing he's been trained to do his entire life: run for a full term. That involves raising a lot of money, living on the road, compromising a lot to gain support and almost certainly losing, probably in the primary.
Or, he can quit. He can win the embrace of his party, of power brokers and his family by quitting now, as opposed to losing later.
It's hard to see a better illustration of the Dip. In elections, you win or you lose. He's almost certain to lose. The dip is deep and long and essentially unsurvivable. If he quits now, anoints an electable successor, acts as a power broker and walks away while he can, he gets to choose his next life. If he runs and wins, that's terrific. But if he runs and loses… not so good.
I can understand why it's hard for him to quit. It's unnatural. But that doesn't mean that he (and the rest of us) can't profit from deciding in advance when to quit (before the market decides for us).

Empathy,"I have no idea what it's like to be pregnant.
And for most of us, we have no idea what it's like to have $3 to spend on a day's food, or $4,000,000 to spend on a jet. We have no idea what it feels like to be lost in a big city, no idea how confusing it is to go online for the first time, no idea what it's like to own four houses.
Marketers and pundits and writers and bloggers and bosses pretend they are empathetic, but we never can be. Sure, we can try, we can be open to cues and sensitive to clues, but no, we don't really know.
Being certain about how someone else feels or what motivates them is foolish. Don't declare that you know exactly why someone made a choice or predict what someone is going to do next, and why. It's a great parlor trick, but you're probably going to be wrong. (I think the one universal exception is fear. We all know what it means to be afraid, and fear doesn't change based on income or gender. The causes change, but the fear remains the same.)
Empathy is a hugely powerful marketing tool if we use it gently, being sure to leave lots of room for error. When we say, ""oh, you did that to make a quick buck or you did that because you hate that guy or you did that because you're a man…"" we've closed the door to actually allowing people to write their own story and you make it difficult to learn what actually makes them tick.","October 20, 2009","Empathy, Understanding, Marketing"
True believers (and the truth),"The internet has amplified the volume of the true believers, the defenders of any faith.
If you're into high end stereo, it's far easier to find strident voices in defense of $100,000 stereos than ever before. If you have strong views on health care (either side) it's not hard to find the orthodox and articulate believers. It's not just specialty magazines or conferences any longer. The true believers are in our faces every day.
When you lead a tribe, the volume and accessibility of the true believers is a good thing. They're easy to find and they maintain order and create a culture for the group you're leading.
The problem is that these loud voices may be loud, but they might not be right.
If you want them to write glowingly about your company's new stereo, you'll make one that's so obscure and expensive you won't sell very many. If you want them to adore your new restaurant, it might be so edgy and cutting edge that not enough people will actually come and you'll go under.
Go check out the track record of the loudest believers in your industry. They're wrong far more than they are right. In fact, when they love a new tech product or candidate, it might just be the jinx that guarantees failure.
The truth of the market is that the market you sell to isn't filled with true believers. It's filled with human beings who make compromises, who tell stories, who have competing objectives. And as a result, the truth of the market is that the products and services that win (if win means you can make a good living and make positive change) are rarely the products and services that are beloved without reservation by the true believers.","October 19, 2009","true believers, market dynamics, product success"
Fear of apples,"At the farmer's market the other day, not one but three people (perfect strangers) asked me what sort of apple to buy. What do I look like, some sort of apple expert? Apparently.
In our industrialized world, people are now afraid of apples. Afraid of buying the wrong kind. Afraid of making a purchasing mistake or some sort of pie mistake.
And they're afraid of your product and your service. Whatever you sell, there are two big reasons people aren't buying it:
1. They don't know about it.
2. They're afraid of it.
If you can get over those two, then you get the chance to prove that they need it and it's a good value. But as long as people are afraid of what you sell, you're stuck.

The Rule of High School,"Any sufficiently overheated industry will eventually resemble high school. High school is filled with insecurity, social climbing, backbiting, false friends, faux achievements, high drama and not much content. Much of this insecurity comes from a market that doesn't make good judgments, that doesn't understand how to reliably choose between alternatives. So it turns into a popularity contest.
As Tom Hanks reportedly said, ""Hollywood is like high school, but with money.""
Or the fashion magazine industry, which is high school but with more makeup.
Add to that the Internet, which is like high school but with a modem.
Or Twitter, which is high school but only 140 characters at a time.
As in high school, the winners are the ones who don't take it too seriously and understand what they're trying to accomplish. Get stuck in the never ending drama (worrying about what irrelevant people think) and you'll never get anything done.

Cable news thinking has nothing to do with fires or with politics. Instead, it amplifies the worst elements of emotional reaction:

Technologists often tell me, ""this product is very hard to build, that will insulate us from competition and protect our pricing."" It might. For a while. But once you're successful, the competition will figure out a way. They always do.

Apparent risk and actual risk,"There are people who I will never encounter in a restaurant.
That's because when these people go out for dinner, they go to chain restaurants. These are the tourists in New York who seek out the familiar Olive Garden instead of walking down the street toPure.
That's fine. It's a personal choice.
But it got me thinking about the difference between apparent and actual risk, and how that choice affects just about everything we do.
The concierge at a fancy hotel spends her time helping tourists and business travelers avoidapparentrisk. She'll book the boring, defensible, consistent tour, not the crazy guy who's actually a trained architect and a dissident. She'll recommend the restaurant from Zagats, not from Chowhound.
Apparent risk is what keeps someone working at a big company, even if it's doing layoffs. It feels safer to stay there than to do the (apparently) insanely risky thing and start a new venture.
Apparent risk is what gets someone who is afraid of plane crashes to drive, even though driving is more dangerous.
Apparent risk is avoiding the chance that people will laugh at you and instead backing yourself into the very real possibility that you're going to become obsolete or irrelevant.
When things get interesting is when the apparently risky is demonstrably [less safe] than the actually risky.

Traction and friction,"A big car on a wet frozen lake goes nowhere. No traction, no motion.

There's not enough traction online. Too many choices, too few boundaries. It's easy to get stuck because there's nothing to push off of, no box to think outside of.
There's too much friction in stuck industries. The walls have been expanded for so long, you just can't get over them.
The power of online platforms is that they create traction. No, you can't write more than 140 characters, no you can't design any layout you want, no you can't spam everyone with your inane sales pitch. You have something to leverage against, but it's that thing, the friction, that makes it work.

Sales speaks for itself. If you can sell enough to cover what you cost and then some, there will always be someone waiting to hire you.

The tacky techie conundrum,"
[click picture to enlarge]
Our Culture (high and popular) is usually created by people who are happy with the systems the world has given them. Magazine editors don't spend a lot of time wishing for better technology. Opera singers focus more on their singing than on microphone technologies. Novelists proudly use typewriters.
Sure, there are exceptions like Les Paul (who developed the electric guitar) and Mitch Miller (who invented reverb) but these exceptions prove the rule: often, culture is invented by people who are too busy to seek out new technology.
(The bottom left corner of the grid shows the tech-phobic culture-phobic contingent. Not relevant to this discussion so much, but scary nonetheless).
If you take a look at this chart, you can see the danger anyone who introduces new technology faces. While you'll attract Les Paul and the 37Signals guys, you're more likely to attract spammers, scammers, opportunity seekers and others that will bring our culture down as easily as they'll bring it up.
The challenge is in designing structures and transparency that will attract the good guys while burying or repelling those that seek the new technology (because they can't find anywhere else to go). In other words, you either need to move the top left to the top right (not easy, but possible*), or educate the bottom left of the grid in how to contribute to the culture (really difficult indeed). The best new media (like blogs and possibly twitter) open doors to people who didn't used to have a voice. The worst ones (like blogs and possibly twitter) merely create new venues for scams and senseless yelling.

Sometimes, we define a golden age in a market as a time of stability, when one or a few giants capture all of our attention. AT&T telephones, Superman comics, Beatles records, IBM computers, The New York Times… and now Google. Choices are easy, the market grows without a lot of effort and we marvel over the ease of success. Ironically, the success of these winners attracts quixotic entrepreneurs, people who set out to challenge the few who are winning. While we might root for these underdogs, it turns out that they're not the ones who usually change everything. The powerful are still too powerful.

You might buy anasal irrigatorand use it twice a day. It's super weird, and it costs $100, and it works.Really.
And you could (I know, it's horrible) drink two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar every day.
This post is totally off topic, but if I can help a few of you make it through a long winter, it was worth it.
(Actually, to bring it back on topic, the question is: why didn't you know about this stuff already? The answer is that people don't like to talk about it. They don't like recommending a book about health because what if you don't like it or it backfires? And they certainly don't like talking about nasal irrigation. Who would? At a dinner party? At a golf game? When, exactly, does it come up in conversation? It turns out that word of mouth is a complex beast. Certain ideas spread merely because they'refun to talk about. Others, even if they're good ideas, languish. Not a lot you can do about this, unless you can hook your product or service to an idea that's naturally viral, as opposed to insisting that the market do the right thing.)","October 3, 2009","Sinusitis, Relief, Health Tips"
Building books that sell in the digital age,"Jeff sent overthis video, which I didn’t know was online. It’s almost two years old, and more informal (and a lot more self-focused) than my usual talks.
In my presentations, I don’t often go into detail about the tactics I’ve used on books I’ve marketed, so if that’s something you’re interested in, here you go. I hope the lessons from the book business work for you, whatever you sell.

Sell like you buy,"Here are the two most common pleas I hear from marketers,
""Our product is as remarkable as we can make it, and we're trying really hard and it's very important to us that people buy it, but despite our hard work, it's not selling!"" (Hint: calling it a purple cow doesn't make it one).
and
""Our business is built around the status quo, and it's not fair that the market wants something else now.""
In both cases, the marketing pitch is focused around the seller, not the buyer. You wouldn't (and don't) buy from someone who says you ought to choose them even though there's a cooler, more remarkable, cheaper, better product. You don't seek out or talk about status quo brands merely because the marketer is trying really hard.

"“Hop in, I’ll drive.”","Just because someone offers you a lift, doesn't mean you have to take it.
In a joint venture or possible business arrangement, it's reassuring when the other person offers to drive. ""Leave it to me,"" they might say, or, ""I'm socializing this through the organization… be patient, I've done this before and we need to do it this way.""
Often, this is true. It's the honest appraisal of a generous insider, someone who wants both of you to succeed.
But, just as you should never get in a car with a drunk driver, understand that the minute you let the other person drive, you've bought into their process. Spending three months or three years following someone off a cliff is nuts.
I'd rather disappoint you today and refuse your offer of a lift than end up with both of us having wasted hours and hours of time somewhere further down the road. No, you can't pitch this to your husband, that's my job. No, I won't stand by and watch you mangle this before the board.

Watch the money,"""How much life insurance do you have?""
Zig Ziglar liked to say that with that one question, you could tell if someone was a successful life insurance agent. If they're not willing to buy it with their own money, how can they honestly persuade someone else to do so?
If you're in the music business but you never buy tickets or downloads, can you really empathize with the people you're selling to?
My favorite: if you work for a non-profit and you don't give money to charity, what exactly are you doing in this job? I've met some incredibly generous people in the charitable world, but I can also report that a huge number of people—even on the fundraising side—would happily cross the street and risk a beating in order to avoid giving $100 to a cause that's not their own. And the shame of it is that this inaction on their part keeps them from experiencing the very emotion that they try so hard to sell.
Money is more than a transfer of value. It's a statement of belief. An ad agency that won't buy ads, a consultant who won't buy consulting, and a waiter who doesn't tip big—it's a sign, and not a good one.","November 30, 2009","Life Insurance, Empathy, Generosity"

Boundary makers,"Some artists continually seek to tear down boundaries, to find new powder, new territory, new worlds to explore. They're the ones that hop the fence to get to places no one has ever been.
Other artists understand that they need to see the edges of the box if they're going to create work that lasts. No fence, no art.
Can't do both at the same time.
My guess is that you're already one kind of person or the other. When people present you with an opportunity/problem, what's your first reaction? Some people immediately start looking for loopholes or weak boundaries. ""You didn't say we couldn't do xxx"". For these people, the best and most obvious solution is to completely demolish the problem and play by different rules.
Other people, some just as successful, take a hard look at the boundaries and create something that plays within, that follows the rules, but that is likely to win because of this.
In my experience, either can work, but only by someone willing to push harder than most in their push to be remarkable. Going with the flow is a euphemism for failing.","November 28, 2009","boundaries, creativity, problem-solving"

What sort of accent do you have?,"Not only the way you speak—but the way you write and act. More than geography, accents now represent a choice of attitude.
Let's define an accent as the way someone speaks (writes, acts) that's different from the way I do it. So, if I'm from Liverpool and you're from Texas, you have an accent, I don't.
Occasionally, an accent is a marketing advantage. Sounding like Sean Connery might be seen as charming in a New York singles' bar, or sounding like a Harvard man might help a neurologist in Miami Beach. Generally, though, if I think you've got an accent, it's more difficult to trust you.
Can your writing have an accent? Of course it can. Not just grammar errors, but sentence length, exclamation marks and your vocabulary all tag you. And the fonts, colors, pictures and layouts you choose are part of your accent as well. Most of us have no trouble at all telling where an ad or a brochure came from (shyster, NY ad firm, home business, church flyer… you get the idea). This blog has an accent, but I've discovered that it's one that most of the people who read it can live with.
And your actions have a grammar as well. When your little mom-and-pop Middle Eastern restaurant has a policy (no substitutions!) even when the place is empty, you're speaking with an accent, aren't you? There's no right accent, no perfect set of rules or actions for you to follow. The choice of accent is directly related to the worldview of the people you're choosing to connect with.

The magic rule of seven (and the banality of alphabetical order),"If you approve or create online forms or deal with consumer interactions, I hope you'll think about the following:
1. If you have more than seven items in a pull down list, you have failed.
Human beings have no trouble keeping seven ideas in their head (hence the seven digit phone number). So, if asked you, ""what's your favorite kind of music among: polka, reggae, ska, jazz and country"" you can probably juggle those ideas in your head all at once. But if I asked you to pick among 25 movies in a list, it's a lot harder, because you have to keep going back and forth to see if you've got it straight.
So, for example, don't give me a list of possible job descriptions and ask what I do. If it's got 60 items on it and there is no direct match (well, I'm sort of in management and sort a writer and sort of in car repair) then my brain freezes over.
Computers are smarter than people. Don't use long lists of multiple choice when a simple fill in the blank will suffice. This is why asking for my state in a pull down list is inane. Just let me type in the two letters. (Hint: that's why Google works. It's fill in the blank, not multiple choice).
2. For non-complete lists, alphabetical order makes no sense
Sure, if you want to list a group in which I'm sure to find what I'm looking for (all the authors on Amazon, say) then alpha is smart. But if you're showing me, for example, a menu of items for dinner, or the names of your kids, then surely there's a sensible way to index them that actually adds value. ""Here are the appetizers,"" makes more sense than putting avocado salad next to almond pudding.
You could, for example, list your items by price, or by popularity. But putting the ""Melissa"" model slightly above the ""Sherwood"" is just wasteful.","November 22, 2009","user interface, decision-making, organization"
Benefit of the doubt,"It's almost impossible to communicate something clearly and succinctly to everyone, all the time.
So misunderstandings occur.
We misunderstand a comment or a gesture or a policy or a contract.
And then what happens?
Well, if we're engaged with someone we like or trust, we give them the benefit of the doubt. We either assume that what they actually meant was the thing we expected from someone like them, or we ask about it.
If we're engaged with a stranger or someone we don't trust, we assume the worst.
The challenge, then, is to earn the benefit of the doubt. How many of your customers, prospects, vendors, regulators and colleagues give you the benefit of the doubt?
If you worked at it, could you make that number increase?","November 21, 2009","benefit of the doubt, trust, communication"
The amateur scientist (that’s us),"Many people buy a car (probably their single biggest discretionary purchase) based on slamming a door, kicking a tire and judging the handshake of a salesperson.
We choose a surgeon based on the carpeting in his office and a politician by his hair cut.
During the first week of swine flu vaccines in New York, most parents (more than half!) chose to keep their kids out of the program.
Interviewed parents said things like, ""I'm not sure it's safe,"" and ""I wanted to see if it affected other kids…""
No mention of longitudinal studies or long-term side effects. No science at all, really, just rumors and hunches and gut instincts.
This gut-instinct approach served people well for hundreds of thousands of years, but it's pretty clear that it doesn't work in a complex world. Eating salmon at a wedding feels 'safe' because we always have, but of course any professional scientist will tell you that farmed salmon is an ecological disaster. You can't see the problem, so you ignore it.
Audiophiles spend thousands of dollars rewiring the electrical lines in their house with .99999% pure copper, ignoring the fact that the power from the street is in the same old cables. Adding decimal points to our irrationality doesn't change much.
The problem with being an amateur scientist is precisely the reason that marketers relish the opportunity to sell to us, the amateurs: we make stupid decisions, easily manipulated by those who might choose to do the manipulation (on their behalf or on ours).
The news here is not that people are irrational, giving too much credence to the dramatic and the local and the short-term (that's not news), but that people have added a veneer of scientific rationality to their irrational decisions. Armed with Zagats or internet data or some rumor off Snopes, we act as though now we're supremely rational choicemakers.
This is one of the problems with breast cancer screening. It appears to give information, really good information, but in practice, it doesn't. Since the information is vivid, we give it too much credence.
The challenge for people trying to market vaccines or highlight long-term side effects of various consumer choices is that it's much easier to spread a story about exploding cars or hair falling out than it is to spread a story of 'nothing bad happens' or 'no one got the swine flu and died' or 'three years from now, this section of ocean will be dead.' We prefer the vivid anecdote to the dry and statistically useful fact, which in a complex world, is to our detriment.
PS if I was marketing the swine flu vaccine, I'd name it after a kid who died last season and put her picture on the release form. Alas, teaching amateurs like us to be real scientists is going to take a while.","November 20, 2009","irrationality, amateur science, decision-making"
Embracing lifetime value,"If you walk into a company-owned cell phone store to sign up for a contract, what are you worth?
Given the huge gross margins at AT&T and Verizon and the standard two-year contract, I think it's easy to figure on more than $2000 in lifetime value.
If you ran a business where a customer represented an additional $2,000 in profit, how would you staff? How long would you make someone wait? If staff costs $25 an hour, how long would that extra person take to pay off?
Few businesses understand (really understand) just how much a customer is worth. Add to this the additional profit you get from a delighted customer spreading the word–it can easily double or triple the lifetime value.
So, a chiropractor might see a new patient being worth $2,500, easily. And yet… how much is she spending on courting, catering to and seducing that new customer? My guess is that $50 feels like a lot to the doc. Instead of comparing what you invest to the benefit you receive from the first bill, the first visit, the first transaction, it's important to not only recognize but embrace the true lifetime value of one more customer.
Write it down. Post it on the wall. What would happen if you spent 100% of that amount on each of your next ten new customers? That's more money than you have to spend right now, I know that, but what would happen? Imagine how fast you would grow, how quickly the word would spread.
Here's how you'll know when you've really embraced this–a good customer at your podiatry practice (or supermarket or tax firm) walks out the door in a huff and you turn to your partner and say, ""There goes $74,000.""","November 19, 2009","lifetime value, customer satisfaction, business strategy"

You can create a breakthrough. A promotion so powerful that people can't help but engage. An innovation so remarkable, people can't help but talk about it. A pricing strategy or ad campaign that breaks the mold and is worthy of attention. This takes huge guts and substantial investment.
Or you can win with consistent benefits, delivered over time. You win by incrementally earning share, attention and trust. This might take years.

"Debt, equity and a third thing that might work better","If your business needs money, it seems as though you have two choices:
Banks are everywhere, so the idea that they can loan us money seems obvious. And venture capitalists and the companies they fund are in the news all the time… and making a billion dollars sounds like fun.
Here's the thing: for most businesses, most of the time, neither is a realistic option.
Banks aren't in the business of taking risk. Which means that they make boring loans to boring companies for boring purposes. They do everything they can to be riskless. Which means you need to guarantee the loan with your house or with assets worth far more than the loan. Which means that a good idea is not a sufficiently good reason for a loan.
And equity? Well there are two problems. The first is that the number of investments that professional VCs can make is microscopically small compared to the number of businesses that want them. A bigger reason is that if there's no obvious and reliable exit strategy (like going public or selling to a huge public company) then there's no rational reason for someone to make an equity loan. The entire upside comes when you sell, and if you can't easily sell (which is most businesses–they're even harder to sell at a profit than a used car) then there's no VC investment to be had.
But that doesn't mean you're stuck. I'd like you to consider the idea of selling part of your income.
It works like this: you have an idea, a fledgling business or a new market to enter. You find an amateur investor (a wealthy dentist, a retired executive) and raise the money to bring it to market. And in return? The investor gets $xx for every unit you sell. From the first one until forever.
No fancy bookkeeping, no board meetings, no worrying about the accounting. Instead, you pay a royalty on income. The rest is up to you.
Of course, this is exactly how the math of book publishing works. The publisher puts up money and keeps 80 or 90 percent of the income. You get the rest.
It could even run on a sliding scale, with early royalties to the investor being lower, or with a buyout once a certain amount was earned back… If you needed $5,000 for some tooling, perhaps you could offer an investor $100 for every unit you sell until you've paid her $10,000, then $40 a unit forever after that. (typos fixed, sorry).
Need to raise money for a restaurant? It's hard for an investor to figure out how to win by owning equity (because it's so easy for the owner of the restaurant to manipulate profit). But if the investor gets 4% of every check paid, that's money back starting on the first day.
Investors are as irrational as the rest of us. They buy a story and expectation about risk. They buy the excitement of upside. They buy an opportunity to turn one thing into another. Banks want a boring story. Other investors might like this alternative story quite a bit.
My general bias for entrepreneurs starting out is to bootstrap their business, because raising money is so hard and so distracting. But if you've set out to do something that needs cash you can't raise any other way, this is worth exploring. Tell a story to an investor that wants to hear it, and create a cash-flow scenario that makes the investment worth it for both of you.","November 16, 2009","debt, equity, alternative financing"
Learning by analogy,"Some people are way better at this than others.
The other day, I was talking to someone about a complex and specialized issue. It's quite possible that this was the first and only time in the history of the world that this precise set of circumstances had ever occurred. He said, ""do you have an example of how this has worked before for you?""
I was puzzled. I mean, not only hadn't I ever had this precise problem, but no one in the world had.

Teaching the market a lesson,"Some book publishers don't like the Kindle. Either they're afraid of it or they've crunched the numbers and they don't like what they see.

Worried about the medium, they hold back, delay or even refuse to support it.
Which is fine if you have market power, but you likely don't. No publisher does, certainly. The Beatles couldn't stop iTunes from changing the record business by sitting out the platform, and there's no book publisher who can stop the Kindle alone.
It's tempting to look at a high-momentum market innovation, something that brings efficiency but leaves change in its wake, and try to stop it single-handedly. Tempting, but not so smart, I think.The market waits for no one.
The alternative to joining in is to sit out the gameloudly. Don't just hold back your support, organize your peers. Create a (sometimes illegal) coordinated effort to stop innovation. I'm not going to bet much on your efforts, but it will certainly outperform a solo effort.

Hammer time,"So, if it's true that to a person with a hammer, every problem looks like a nail, the really useful question is, ""what sort of hammer do you have?""
At big TV networks, they have a TV hammer. At a surgeon's office, they have the scalpel hammer. A drug counselor has the talk hammer, while a judge probably has the jail hammer.
Maybe it's time for a new hammer…
One study found that when confronted with a patient with back pain, surgeons prescribed surgery, physical therapists thought that therapy was indicated and yes, acupuncturists were sure needles were the answer. Across the entire universe of patients, the single largest indicator of treatment wasn't symptoms or patient background, it was the background of the doctor.
When the market changes, you may be seeing all the new opportunities and problems the wrong way because of the solutions you're used to. The reason so many organizations have trouble using social media is that they are using precisely the wrong hammer.And odds are, they will continue to do so until their organization fails.PR firms try to use the new tools to send press releases, because, you guessed it, that's their hammer.
It's not just about new vs. old. Inveterate community-focused social media mavens often bring that particular hammer to other venues. So they crowdsource keynote speeches or restaurants or board meetings and can't figure out why they don't have the impact others do.

"A new cover, a new foreword, but the same book","
Somehow, I persuaded the publisher to change the cover of this book, and that new cover hit the streets today. The book is the same as before, but there’s a new foreword. Here it is, so you don’t have to buy a second copy. (Old cover is on the left, new cover is on the right).
More than almost any book I’ve written, this is the one that comes up in conversation when I talk to people about getting their ideas out into the world.
This book is about worldviews—the biases and expectations and shortcuts we use to get through the world. Here’s a punchline:when you try to change someone’s worldview forcibly, they get a headache.People become defensive in the face of a frontal assault on their worldview. Cunning is far more effective. And of course, I ignored my own advice by challenging the worldview of my reader right there in the title.
New Foreword
You believe things that aren’t true.
Let me say that a different way: many things that are true are true because you believe them.
The ideas in this book have elected a president, grown non-profit causes, created billionaires and fueled movements. They’ve also led to great jobs, fun dates and more than a few interactions that mattered.
I’ve seen this book in campaign headquarters and carried around at evangelical conferences. I’ve also gotten email from people who have used it in Japan and the UK and yes, Akron, Ohio. The ideas here work, because they are simple tools to understand what human beings do when they encounter you and your organization.
Here’s the first half of the simple summary: We believe what we want to believe, and once we believe something, it becomes a self-fulfilling truth. (Jump ahead a few paragraphs to read the critical second part of this summary)
If you think that (more expensive) wine is better, then it is. If you think your new boss is going to be more effective, then she will be. If you love the way a car handles, then you’re going to enjoy driving it.
That sounds so obvious, but if it is, why is it so ignored? Ignored by marketers, ignored by ordinarily rational consumers and ignored by our leaders.
Once we move beyond the simple satisfaction of needs, we move into the complex satisfaction of wants. And wants are hard to measure and difficult to understand. Which makes marketing the fascinating exercise it is.
Here’s the second part of the summary: When you are busy telling stories to people who want to hear them, you’ll be tempted to tell stories that just don’t hold up. Lies. Deceptions.
This sort of storytelling used to work pretty well. Joe McCarthy became famous while lying about the “Communist threat.” Bottled water companies made billions while lying about the purity of their product compared to tap water in the developed world.
The thing is, lying doesn’t pay off any more. That’s because when you fabricate a story that just doesn’t hold up to scrutiny, you get caught. Fast.
So, it’s tempting to put up a demagogue for Vice President, but it doesn’t take long for the reality to catch up with the story. It’s tempting to spin a tall tale about a piece of technology or a customer service policy, but once we see it in the wild, we talk about it and you whither away.
That’s why I think this book is one of the most important I’ve ever written. It talks about two sides of a universal truth, one that has built every successful brand, organization and candidate, and one that we rarely have the words to describe.
Here are the questions I hope you’ll ask (your boss, your colleagues, your clients) after you’ve read this book:
“What’s your story?”“Will the people who need to hear this story believe it?”“Is it true?”
Every day, we see mammoth technology brands fail because they failed to ask and answer these questions. We see worthy candidates gain little attention, and flawed ones bite the dust. There are small businesses that are so focused on what they do that they forget to take the time to describe the story of why they do it. And on and on.
If what you’re doing matters, really matters, then I hope you’ll take the time to tell a story. A story that resonates and a story that can become true.
The irony is that I did a lousy job of telling a story about this book. The original cover seemed to be about lying and seemed to imply that my readers (marketers) were bad people. For people who bothered to read the book, they could see that this wasn’t true, but by the time they opened the cover, it was too late. A story was already told. I had failed.
You don’t get a second chance in publishing very often, and I’m thrilled that my publisher let me try a new cover, and triply thrilled that it worked. After all, you’re reading this.
So, go tell a story. If it doesn’t resonate, tell a different one. When you find a story that works, live that story, make it true, authentic and subject to scrutiny. All marketers are storytellers, only the losers are liars.

Your customers define what you make, how you make it, where you sell it, what you charge, who you hire and even how you fund your business. If your customer base changes over time but you fail to make changes in the rest of your organization, stress and failure will follow.
Sell to angry cheapskates and your business will reflect that. On the other hand, when you find great customers, they will eagerly co-create with you. They will engage and invent and spread the word.
It takes vision and guts to turn someone down and focus on a different segment, on people who might be more difficult to sell at first, but will lead you where you want to go over time.",,"Customer selection, business strategy, target market"
The why imperative,"Successful organizations spend a lot of time saying, ""that's not what we do.""
It's a requirement, because if you do everything, in every way, you're sunk. You got to where you are by standing for something, by approaching markets and situations in a certain way. Sure, Nike could make money in the short run by licensing their name to a line of wines and spirits, but that's not what they do.
""That's not what we do,"" is the backbone of strategy, it determines who you are and where you're going.
Except in times of change. Except when opportunities come along. Except when people in the organization forget to ask, ""why?""
If the only reason you don't do something is because you never did, that's not a good reason. If the environment has changed dramatically and you are feeling pain because of it, this is a great reason to question yourself, to ask why.
The why factor is really clear online. Simon and Schuster or the Encyclopedia Britannica could have become Google (organizing the world's information) but they didn't build a search engine because that's not what they do. Struggling newspapers could have become thriving networks of long tail content, but they chose not to, because that's not what they do.
Why?
That's the key question, one that organizations large and small need to ask a lot more often now that the economy is officially playing by new rules.","November 10, 2009","strategy, adaptability, questioning"
Upside vs. downside,"How much of time, staffing and money does your organization spend on creating incredible experiences (vs. avoiding bad outcomes)?
At the hospital, it's probably 5% on the upside (the doctor who puts in the stitches, say) and 95% on the downside (all the avoidance of infection or lawsuits, records to keep, forms to sign). Most of the people you interact with in a hospital aren't there to help you get what you came for (to get better) they're there to help you avoid getting worse. At an avant garde art show, on the other hand, perhaps 95% of the effort goes into creating and presenting shocking ideas, with just 5% devoted to keeping the place warm or avoiding falls and spills as you walk in.
Which is probably as it should be.
But what about you and your organization? As you get bigger and older, are you busy ensuring that a bad thing won't happen that might upset your day, or are you aggressively investing in having a remarkable thing happen that will delight or move a customer?
A new restaurant might rely on fresh vegetables and whatever they can get at the market. The bigger, more established fast-food chain starts shipping in processed canned food. One is less reliable with bigger upside, the other—more dependable with less downside.
Here's a rule that's so inevitable that it's almost a law:As an organization grows and succeeds, it sows the seeds of its own demise by getting boring.With more to lose and more people to lose it, meetings and policies become more about avoiding risk than providing joy.","November 9, 2009","organizational risk, customer experience, resource allocation"
Fabulous,"This is so cool: because we only look at things we want to look at, only talk about things worth talking about, the amount of fabulous in the world continues to rise exponentially.
Even though we're at the tail end of the great recession, think about all the cool stuff in your life. Not just stuff you can buy, but experiences, works of art, innovations of all kinds… the bar has been raised for what you need to do to be noticed, and the market is responding.
Not only do I notice more fabulous, but it sure seems as though the creators of it are more engaged, dedicated and yes, joyful, than I can remember. If there was ever a moment to follow your passion and do work that matters, this is it. You can't say, ""but I need to make a fortune instead,"" because that's not happening right now. So you might as well join the people who can say, ""I love doing this.""","November 8, 2009","fabulous, passion, creativity"
Take what you can get (?),"When you're just starting out or when your organization is struggling or when the economy isn't hot, it's very tempting to take what you can get.
You just graduated from law school and you have a lot of debt and the best job you can get is doing collections work. Should you take it?
Your consulting firm is organized around providing high-value work for large corporations, but the only gigs you can get in the consideration set for are small, struggling companies looking to spend a few hundred dollars a day. Should you take them?
The list goes on and on.
There are two things worth remembering here:
Surviving is succeeding, no doubt about it. Doing the work is better than not doing the work. Waiting for perfect is never as smart as making progress. But, and it's a huge but, you define yourself by the work you do, and perhaps you need to redefine what you're willing to take and where you're looking for it.","November 7, 2009","career choices, survival, redefining values"
Everyone is clueless,"The problem with ""everyone"" is that in order to reach everyone or teach everyone or sell to everyone, you need to so water down what you've got you end up with almost nothing.
Everyone doesn't go to the chiropractor, everyone doesn't give to charity, everyone has never been to Starbucks. Everyone, in fact, lives a decade behind the times and needs hundreds of impressions and lots of direct experience before they realize something is going on.
You don't want everyone. You want the right someone.
Someone who cares about what you do. Someone who will make a contribution that matters. Someone who will spread the word.
As soon as you start focusing on finding the right someone, things get better, fast. That's because you can ignore everyone and settle in and focus on the people you actually want.
Here's avideothat David sent over. I am thrilled at how much this guy loves his job, and I'm inspired by his story of how he turned down Pepsi as a vendor.He turned them down. But everyone wants Pepsi! Exactly. Once he decided he wanted someone, not everyone, his life got a lot better.","November 6, 2009","target audience, focus, quality over quantity"
The unclicking 84%,"Mark points us to thisgreat set of stats.
Basically, all of the clicks for all the ads online come from only 16% of the surfers, and most of them come from just 4% of all internet users.
So, if you optimize your ads for clicks, it means you're ignoring a huge population.
If your business is built around the kind of person who clicks, you win. If it isn't, you either need to not buy ads online or buy ads optimized for attention and familiarity, not clicks.
Imagine that only left-handed people clicked on ads (it's about the same percent). What are you going to do if you make a product for the right-handed portion of the population?
It's okay to make an ad that isn't easy to measure. If it works, that's enough.","November 5, 2009","ad optimization, online advertising, user engagement"
When data and decisions collide,"Until recently, most of the decisions we were called on to make were based on hunches, insight and a little bit of data. Occasionally, a field like direct marketing would develop into something quite data-driven (""I don't care if you like mailer one, Smythe, mailer #2 did three times, better! Number 2 it is."") but not often.
It tookIgnaz Semmelweismore than twenty years (he died before it happened, actually) to persuade doctors that washing their hands could save the lives of mothers giving birth. He had the data, he had the proof, but that wasn't enough to change minds.
Data mining and the proximity of the internet to most of what we do is changing the proximity of proof to decision. Now, you don't need to do a lot of research, the data is just a click away.
What are you going to do when your hunches don't match the data that's now pouring in?
The data shows, for example, that texting while driving is moredangerousthan driving drunk. It doesn't feel that way, of course, but will you respect the data and stop, cold turkey?
The data shows that the vast majority of wine drinkers can't tell the difference between a $20 bottle and a $100 bottle. Will that keep you from buying the fancy wine? How much is the placebo effect worth?
The data shows that famous colleges underperform many cheaper, friendlier,smallercolleges. How much is your neighbor's envy worth?
These are just a few of the millions of examples of counter-intuitive data-driven findings. It took Galileo decades to persuade people the light objects fell as fast as heavy ones… even though he was busy dropping them off buildings for all to see. I wonder how long it will take us to get our arms around this avalanche of insight. Probably longer than most of us think, and marketers that jump too quickly to data are going to be disappointed (while lifehackers that use the data are going to continue to have a huge advantage).","November 4, 2009","Data-driven decisions, counter-intuitive findings, decision-making challenges"
Limited edition boxed set available today SOLD OUT!,"[We ended up selling more than three a minute. You guys are so cool. We had a few counter problems, but it didn't effect the number we sold…they're all gone, 800 in total, and I won't be able to sell any more. Thank you for the energy and support!]
It seems as though the Apple tablet is unlikely to be ready in time for the holidays… what to get?
How about a boxed (a wooden box) set of five of my books? Very limited (only 800 will be sold, ever). Sold at a discount from retail, with cool packaging, assembled by elves, delivered by Martians, blessed by enlightened goats.
My goal was to make a rare item, even if it doesn’t make any money. More and more, I’m thinking of books as artifacts and souvenirs, as convenient and collectible packages for ideas that spread. I’m hoping that for a few hundred people, thisboxed setwill be an example of that.
The set includesTribes,The DipandMeatball Sundae. Also included is the fancy newPurple Cow(new because it includes twenty more pages of user-suggested purple cows) and the extra-fancy newAll Marketers are Liars(new because it has a new cover–a better cover, actually, more on that later–and a new foreword).
If you want to buy any of the books individually (no box), use the links you can findhere.If you’ve read some or all of these before, even better! What would make a happier gift for the clueless marketer in your life?The details arehere, so be sure to read the fine print.
I’m sorry if they sell out before you get there, but first come first served seemed like a fair way to handle it. Remember,one per customer!If you pay for more than one, we'll donate extra payments to charity.

Ms. In-between,"The either-or world continues to decay, confronted by a shifting economy and the tools of the net.
It used to be easy to tell if someone was a journalist. Either you were or your weren't. So giving special privileges to journalists was easy. Parking permits, press badges, first amendment protections… no problem, you're a journalist. Everyone else? No way.
It used to be easy to tell if someone was an entrepreneur. Either you had a full-time job or you ran a business. So we could treat employees the same (health insurance, no moonlighting) and assume that the few that didn't have jobs were full-time freelancers or entrepreneurs.
It used to be easy to figure out who did the buying at an organization. The purchasing department did. So we knew who to call on.
Now, of course, it's all jumbled up. Everyone is a journalist, of course, but just a few do it for a living. Everyone is a freelancer, or, at the very least, always looking for the next gig. Everyone with a credit card can do the purchasing, they just expense it.
Society hates this. It means we need to make up new rules, FTC disclosures, legal principles, safety nets and more.
Marketers love this, because it means change and that means opportunity.

Help your customers avoid taking responsibility,"It's interesting to see that people are much better at putting up with things that happen to them than they are at living with the consequences of a bad choice.
When you can blame someone else (or the gods of spite, chance and bad luck) it's emotionally safer than it is to acknowledge you made a lousy choice.
If the weather is freakishly bad on your vacation, you can embrace pity from your friends, and spend your angst cursing the storms.
On the other hand, if you book a trip in the middle of hurricane season, you've got no one to blame but yourself.
This is a great opportunity for marketers and others that want to engage with the public. If you can figure out how to communicate, ""it's not your fault,"" then people will be grateful, and they'll return. It might not be right, it might not be mature and it might not be the behavior society wants to advance, but it works.
Even better, figure out how to teach your customers to enjoy taking responsibility. It's the long term solution that builds a healthy relationship between customer and vendor… you coach them on good choices and they embrace what happens after they make them.","November 2, 2009","customer responsibility, blame, marketing strategies"
Attention lust and Olympic craziness,"For many organizations and individuals, attention is the most precious resource. The pursuit of attention for our ads, or our city or our careers dominates all else.
How else to explain thesilly maththat is used to justify Olympic hoopla? Can imagine how little patience people would have for the IOC and their internal politics if they didn't have a show that so many people wanted to watch?
Almost every city that has hosted an Olympics regrets it financially. The TV networks spend billions. The advertisers pay for it. The hoopla is vast and loud.
For what?
For the attention. It's the attention that gets cities to put up with the ridiculous system for choosing host cities and gets the TV networks to ship camera crews half way around the world. It's the attention that turns the Olympic committee into vigilant trademark and copyright police. It's easy to cut countries or companies willing to bankrupt themselves for pride or attention a little slack. After all, the Olympics is a magical event.
Except it's not. The same craving for attention happens every day in every organization in search of just one more pair of eyeballs. As marketers discover that more eyeballs does not equal better, the quixotic quest for attention will start to abate.
The formula is simple but depressing: marketers have been lousy at harvesting attention because there was just so much of it. So it was more like strip mining than careful, efficient use of a natural resource. Now that attention is harder to get, people are overpaying for it and the Olympics is just one example. The alternative is to create focused, intense networks that ignore the masses. For most marketers, that's exactly what we need.","November 1, 2009","Attention, Olympics, Marketing"
Seven years gone,"A friend worried out loud to me the other day, ""I spent the last seven months doing this [job] and I have nothing to show for it. If I had known I would have spent seven months and gotten nothing, you can bet I would have done something a lot more fun.""
Ten years ago inFast Company,I wrote this postabout the decade that ends today.
The oughts (the ""uh-ohs""?) were a tough decade on a macro level. Front page news events will give the textbooks plenty to write about in the years to come.
But on a micro level, on a personal level, this was a decade filled with opportunity. The internet transformed our lives forever. Opportunities were created (and many were taken advantage of). And, like every decade,just about everyone missed it.Just about everyone hunkered down and did their job or did what they were told or did what they thought they were supposed to, and just about everyone got very little as a result.
Maybe ten years is too long a period of time to plan for. So how about seven?
Seven years from now, what will you have to show for what you're doing right now?
If your answer is, ""not much,"" perhaps you should consider a new plan, one that might generate a different answer, or, at the very least, be a more fun way to waste seven years.","December 31, 2009","opportunity, reflection, decade"
Cheapest reliable alternative,"For most products and services, most of the time, people sign up for the Cheapest Reliable Alternative Plan.
If everything appears to be the same, then of course they're going to pick the cheapest one that's good enough.
In the face of this understandable strategy, you have a few choices:
You can be cheapest (difficult to sustain).
You can be more reliable (great if you can figure this out).
You can redefine the playing the field to be the only one (most preferred).
Buying a new microphone or lights for your DJ business doesn't do any of these three to your competitive status, it merely makes you feel good. Same with re-organizing your office, painting the parking spaces or buying a new laptop. They merely keep you where you were.
The scalable, profitable strategy is to change the game, not to become the most average.","December 30, 2009","Cheapest, Reliable, Competitive Strategy"
Put a name on it,"Here's a positive step to avoid the faceless bureaucracy that wants to take over your organization:
Every new rule needs to be associated with one and only one person who is willing to stand up for it and explain it (to your people and to the public).
""No swimming until 45 minutes after eating."" Really? Why? Who made this rule up? Why?
I think most international travelers would like to know who made the rule that bans wifi from international flights. Or the name of the other person who made the rule that you can't have a blanket covering your legs during the last hour of a flight. If we knew the bureaucrat's name, could we lobby to have them fired for being ridiculous actors in security theater?
Organizations thrive on their ability to allow individuals to remain faceless. It permits them to act badly, not in the interest of their customers.
One of the reasons I so enjoy buying from small companies is that you know exactly who has their name on each and every policy. It builds a more responsive organization and it's good marketing.","December 29, 2009","accountability, bureaucracy, transparency"
It’s not the rats you need to worry about,"If you want to know if a ship is going to sink, watch what the richest passengers do.
iTunes and file sharing killed Tower Records. The key symptom: the best customers switched. Of course people who were buying 200 records a year would switch. They had the most incentive. The alternatives were cheaper and faster mostly for the heavy users.
Amazon and the Kindle have killed the bookstore. Why? Because people who buy 100 or 300 books a year are gone forever. The typical American buys just one book a year for pleasure. Those people are meaningless to a bookstore. It's the heavy users that matter, and now officially, as 2009 ends, they have abandoned the bookstore. It's over.
When law firms started switching to fax machines, Fedex realized that the cash cow part of their business (100 or 1000 or more envelopes per firm per day) was over and switched fast to packages. Good for them.

How far away is your future?,"Let's try a thought experiment:
A flying saucer comes to Earth, destroys a major city to get our attention, then announces that in 10,000 years it is coming back to destroy the Earth. In order to eliminate any doubt, it then blows up Mars.

Represent,"The great brands of our time are not about what they are. They are about what they represent.
Apple, Sarah Palin, Harley Davidson, Tom's Shoes… In each case, the reality of the product means far less than what the brand represents.
The facts of iPod battery life, knowledge of world affairs, gas mileage and foot comfort are almost irrelevant. What matters is the Jungian rush these brands connote, their ability to allow us to identify ourselves and fellow tribe members, the sense of belonging and labeling and the journey we're on (or not, our choice).
Great brands represent something bigger than themselves. You can create this accidentally if you're lucky, but you can create it on purpose if you try.",,"brand identity, representation, belonging"
Learning from bad graphs and weak analysis,"Yesterday's Times features ablog postabout the Kindle. There's a lot wrong with the post (which hopefully has been corrected by the time you read this) and I thought I'd point out two useful lessons. Nick Bilton, the author of the post, also did the graphs, and as a former newspaper art director, he has no one else to blame for the way the graphs appear or are interpreted. [Nick changed his post before my post went live this morning, and he dropped me a line indicating that his graphs weren't supposed to be deceptive, they were merely mislabeled. I think the points in my post below still stand.]
As you can see from the graph to the right, [it appears that] he's trying to make the case that lots and lots of Kindle owners are really unhappy (the large gold wedges).
Problem 1: The [original pie charts Nick used, at right, are incorrect]. The corrected one is below. 7% is a much smaller number than you see to the right.
Problem 2: Many of the reviews are from people who don't own the device.
Problem 3: Amazon reviews never reflect the product, they reflect the passion people have for the product. As Jeff Bezos has pointed out again and again, most great products get 5 star and 1 star reviews. That makes sense… why would you be passionate enough about something that's sort of 'meh' to bother writing a three star review?
Problem 4: This is a useful insight for anyone who markets anything–the people who buy the first generation of a product are more likely to be enthusiasts. They are more forgiving. Theylikenew things. Bilton has tried to invent a trend by lining the items up in chronological order, but this is deceptive, both because of the number of reviews, but mostly because the people reviewing the new ones have a different agenda.
The Kindle has managed to offend exactly the right people in exactly the right ways. It's not as boring as it could be, it excites passions and it has created a cadre of insanely loyal evangelists who are buying them by the handful to give as gifts.
I think the lessons here are: Ignore graphs intended to deceive and understand the value of the negative review.
PS, as a bonus, here's the same analysis of the reviews ofCatcher in the Rye, a book that has sold more than 20,000,000 copies (and changed many lives)–and the author doesn't even have a blog.","December 26, 2009","bad graphs, analysis, Amazon reviews"

The difference between hiring and recruiting,"Bob wonders if there's a difference. I'm pretty sure there is.
Hiring is what you do when you let the world know that you're accepting applications from people looking for a job.
Recruiting is the act of finding the very best person for a job and persuading them to stop doing what they're doing and come join you.
Hiring is easy and fast and is basically a retail operation.
Recruiting is artful and slow and is essentially a direct marketing effort.
Recruiting raises the bar because it demands you have a job worth quitting for. The recruiter doesn't solve an urgent problem for the person being recruited, in fact, they create one. That person already has a job (hence no problem). The problem being created is that until they change over to your job, they'll be unhappy. That's a huge hurdle for a job to overcome, which leads to this key question:
Is your job opening so good you could recruit great people for it?
If not, perhaps you need to work on that.","December 24, 2009","Hiring, Recruiting, Job Quality"
"First, organize 1,000","Kevin Kelly really changed our thinking withhis post about 1,000 true fans.
But what if you're not an artist or a musician? Is there a business case for this?
I think the ability to find and organize 1,000 people is a breakthrough opportunity. One thousand people coordinating their actions is enough to change your world (and make a living.)
1,000 people each spending $1,000 on a special interest cruise equals a million dollars.
1,000 people willing to spend $250 to attend a day-long seminar gives you the leverage to invite just about anyone you can imagine to fly in and speak.
1,000 people voting as a bloc can change local politics forever.
1,000 people willing to try a new restaurant you find for them gives you the ability to make an entrepreneur successful and change the landscape of your town.
Even better, coordinating the learning and connections of this tribe of 1,000 is not just profitable, it's rewarding. If you can take them where they want to go, you become indispensable (and respected).
What's difficult? What's difficult is changing your attitude. Instead of speed dating your way to interruption, instead of yelling at strangers all day trying to make a living, coordinating a tribe of 1,000 requires patience, consistency and a focus on long-term relationships and life time value.

Apparently, a computer is now not a computer, it's an opportunity to upsell you.
First, the setup insisted (for my own safety) that I sign up for an eternal subscription to Norton. Then it defaulted (opt out) to sending me promotional emails.

Fear of bad ideas,"A few people are afraid of good ideas, ideas that make a difference or contribute in some way. Good ideas bring change, that's frightening.
But many people are petrified of bad ideas. Ideas that make us look stupid or waste time or money or create some sort of backlash.
The problem is that you can't have good ideas unless you're willing to generate a lot of bad ones.
Painters, musicians, entrepreneurs, writers, chiropractors, accountants–we all fail far more than we succeed. We fail at closing a sale or playing a note. We fail at an idea for a series of paintings or the theme for a trade show booth.
But we succeed far more often than people who have no ideas at all.
Someone asked me where I get all my good ideas, explaining that it takes him a month or two to come up with one and I seem to have more than that. I asked him how many bad ideas he has every month. He paused and said, ""none.""

In search of customer intimacy,"Many brands want deep and long-lasting relationships with their customers.
Social media makes these interactions even more likely, because it encourages customers to speak up and to connect.

Instead, the goal should be to get your customers to share their dreams, not their peeves.","December 20, 2009","Customer intimacy, social media, relationships"
You don’t have the power,"A friend is building a skating rink. Unfortunately, he started with uneven ground and the water keeps ending up on one side of the rink. Water's like that, and you need a lot of time and power and money if you want to change it. One person, working as hard as he can, has little chance of persuading water to change.
Consider this quote from a high-rankingbook publisherwho should know better, ""We must do everything in our power to uphold the value of our content against the downward pressures exerted by the marketplace and the perception that 'digital' means 'cheap.' …""
Hello?
You don't have the power. Maybe if every person who has ever published a book or is ever considering publishing a book got together and made a pact, then they'd have enough power to fight the market. But solo? Exhort all you want, it's not going to do anything but make you hoarse.
Movie execs thought they had the power to fight TV. Record execs thought they had the power to fight iTunes. Magazine execs thought they had the power to fight the web. Newspaper execs thought they had the power to fight Craigslist.
Here's a way to think about it, inspired by Merlin Mann: Imagine that next year your company is going to make 10 million dollars instead of a hundred million dollars in profit. What would you do knowing that your profits were going to be far less than they are today? Because that's exactly what the upstart with nothing to lose is going to do. Ten million in profit is a lot to someone starting with zero and trying to gain share. They don't care that you made a hundred million last year from the old model.
If I'm an upstart publisher or a little-known author, you can bet I'm happy to sell my work at $5 and earn seventy cents a copy if I can sell a million.
Smart businesspeople focus on the things they have the power to change, not whining about the things they don't.
Existing publishers have the power to change the form of what they do, increase the value, increase the speed, segment the audience, create communities, lead tribes, generate breakthroughs that make us gasp. They don't have the power to demand that we pay more for the same stuff that others will sell for much less.

"Think like me, agree with me","When you're trying to sell your idea, it's natural to assume that the people you're selling to think the way you do. If you can only show them the facts and stories that led you to believe what you believe, then of course they'll end up where you are… believing.
The problem, of course, is that people don't always think like you.
Go watch some videos of people of different political ideologies talking about why they support a candidate other than your candidate. These people are stupid! They can't conjugate an idea, they have no factual basis for their beliefs, they are clueless, they are ideologues, they are parroting a talking head who knows even less than they do! (And those epithets apply to anyone you disagree with, of course). In fact, they're saying the same thing about you.
Same goes for diehard fans of the other brand, or worse, the clueless who should be using your solution, but don't even care enough to use your competitor's product.
If they only thought like you, of course, and knew what you know, then there wouldn't be a problem.
The challenge doesn't lie in getting them to know what you know. It won't help. The challenge lies in helping them see your idea through their lens, not yours. If you study the way religions and political movements spread, you can see that this is exactly how it works. Marketers of successful ideas rarely market the facts. Instead, they market stories that match the worldview of the people being marketed to.
[There's an alternative, one that you might want to think hard about: perhaps you should only market your idea to people who already think the way you do. After all, you're not running for president, you don't need a majority. Screen people by their behavior (what they read, what they buy, how they act) and only tell your story to the people who will embrace it. That's a lot easier to do that than it's ever been before.]","December 18, 2009","perspective, marketing strategies, beliefs"
Different kinds of work,"If your boss asks you to move a box from point a to point b, it's probably not okay to say, ""I don't feel like it right now.""
If you work on the chain gang and it's time to dig a ditch, you don't get a reprieve if you roll your eyes and say, ""that's not what they pay me for.""
And if you're a dishwasher, you don't get a chance to say, ""I guess I'm just not the kind of person who's good at putting his hands into really hot soapy water all day.""
And yet.
And yet when we ask you to look people in the eye, be creative, brainstorm, be generous, find a way to satisfy an angry customer, work with a bully, learn a new skill or bring joy to work, suddenly the excuses pile up. Is this a different sort of work? Is raising your hand in class too much to ask of you?

Dancing with entropy,"It's far easier to mix up a Rubik's cube than to solve one.
People are often paid to enforce compliance. The job is to ensure that everything is in its place, that errors are zero, that things are delivered on time and as expected. The random event is a problem, something to be feared and extinguished.
A few people (not many) get paid to create a ruckus, to insert the random, to yell 'fire' and to shake things up.
Most people, though, the ones with great jobs, are in the business of dancing with entropy, not creating it. Take what comes, sort it, leverage it, improvise and make something worthwhile out of it.
The secret of dancing is that you must respect and admire your partner. Thus, entropy isn't the enemy, and the goal isn't for ""everything to be all right.""
Without random events, there is no dance.
There is no good, there is no bad, there's just what happened. Dance with it.",,"entropy, randomness, improvisation"

define: Brand,"Here’s my definition:A brand is the set of expectations, memories, stories and relationships that, taken together, account for a consumer’s decision to choose one product or service over another.If the consumer (whether it’s a business, a buyer, a voter or a donor) doesn’t pay a premium, make a selection or spread the word, then no brand value exists for that consumer.
A brand’s value is merely the sum total of how much extra people will pay, or how often they choose, the expectations, memories, stories and relationships of one brand over the alternatives.
A brand used to be something else. It used to be a logo or a design or a wrapper. Today, that’s a shadow of the brand, something that might mark the brand’s existence. But just as it takes more than a hat to be a cowboy, it takes more than a designer prattling on about texture to make a brand. If you’ve never heard of it, if you wouldn’t choose it, if you don’t recommend it, then there is no brand, at least not for you.
If you hear a designer say this (believe it or not, I didn’t make this quote up), “A TCHO Chocolate bar, with its algorithmic guilloche patterns, looks like a modern form of currency. “Modern” was always part of the brand brief — no faux traditionalism, but resolutely forward-looking for a new generation of chocolate enthusiasts…” then I wonder if there’s a vocabulary disconnect.
Design is essential but design is not brand.

This data is far more accurate than the charts Alexa offers, because most of the sites being measured cooperate. I'm pretty proud of Squidoo hitting thetop 100sites in the US.
You can see the referrals and traffic to an individual bitly twitter URL by copying the URL and adding + sign to it. For example, if you see something like this in a tweet:http://bit.ly/870Ry9just copy it and paste it with the plus and you'll seehttp://bit.ly/870Ry9+.I think that's pretty neat.

Who controls your media?,"1966: NBC, CBS and ABC decided what I did every night at 8 pm.
Today: are you still ceding control to others?
It's easy to allow 'them' to dictate how (and how often) you friend or post or follow or tweet…
Shouldn't you be the one who decides?
If your Facebook circle is draining your energy and not pushing you forward, why, precisely, is it there? If you are spending more than a few minutes a day on Twitter, is it because you can't stop or because stopping will cost you your goals?

The magic of dynamic pricing,"Status quo seekers in publishing are now talking aboutdelayingKindle and other ebook editions of their new books. The idea would be to come out with a hardcover, then a few months later an ebook, then a year later a paperback.
This is lame-brained thinking on many levels, one involvingteaching the market a lesson. Leaving that aside, it ignores the magic of dynamic pricing.
When you produce a physical good like a book, it's really hard to change the price over time, especially if there are retail stores involved. But changing the price on an electronic good is trivially easy.
So, for example, you could charge $24 for the Kindle edition for the first two weeks, then $15 for the next two weeks and then $9 for the year after that. Once it's a backlist classic, it could cost $2…
Or, thinking about how you might create launch excitement, you could reverse it. $2 the first day, $5 the first week, then $9 later. Better hurry!
Or, to get more sophisticated, you could reward the market for getting excited. What if the price for everyone drops if enough people pre-order it?
This isn't just about books, of course. It's about anything where you have the ability to change pricing based on time or demand… tolls, music, phone calls, consulting… We need to stop assuming that digital goods are just like physical goods, but shinier.
Technology puts a lot more pressure on your imagination and creativity, even in pricing.","December 10, 2009","dynamic pricing, ebook editions, market strategy"
The reason social media is so difficult for most organizations,"It's a process, not an event.
Dating is a process. So is losing weight, being a public company and building a brand.
On the other hand, putting up a trade show booth is an event. So are going public and having surgery.
Events are easier to manage, pay for and get excited about. Processes build results for the long haul.",,"social media, process, branding"
Lead with your glass jaw,"Here's one way businesses can profit from a social media presence:
Make it easy to get hurt.
If you're in a low trust industry (like car sales), a social media presence dramatically increases the opportunity people have to call you out, beat you up, tattle on you and flame you in public. If you have a Facebook page and people can YELL at you there, for all to see, it makes you vulnerable. Do you really think that a Chris or a Guy or Gary is going to risk ripping you off for consulting or wine? No way. Too easy for someone to post a comeback for all to see.
When your staff sees how much power you've given random consumers, they'll freak. And then, magically, they'll start treating customers differently, because maybe, just maybe, this customer is the one who's going to use the power. Suddenly, the answer to, ""do you know who I am!!"" is, ""yes sire, forgive me.""
It might not be comfortable, but you can bet it will build trust.","December 9, 2009","social media, trust, vulnerability"
Fallback for the 2%,"If you ask one hundred people to do a task (particularly one that involves following instructions or using a computer or both), figure that two of them will mess it up.
It doesn't matter if you use ALL CAPITAL LETTERS. It doesn't matter if your instructions are crystal clear. It doesn't matter if you ask them to sign a release. Two percent will mess it up. And it won't always be the same two percent either, so the idea of kicking the clueless out won't work.
Which means you only have two choices:
Technologists hate this choice, but it's true. We have to plan for human failure and part of our job is to have the resources and back up to allow these people to remain in our tribe even though they're unable to follow a simple instruction.
[Can I just clarify that the first choice isn't the only choice. Plenty of successful designers (including Apple) gladly choose the second. Pleasing everyone isn't required. Making the choice intentionally is.]","December 8, 2009","human failure, instructions, design choices"
How to protect your ideas in the digital age,"If we're in the idea business, how to protect those ideas?
One way is to misusetrademarklaw. With the help of search engines, greedy lawyers who charge by the letter are busy sending claim letters to anyone who even comes close to using a word or phrase they believe their client 'owns'. News flash: trademark law is designed to make it clear whomakesa good or a service. It's a mark we put on something we create to indicate the source of the thing, not the inventor of a word or even a symbol. They didn't invent trademark law to prevent me from putting a picture of your cricket team's logo on my blog. They invented it to make it clear who was selling you something (a mark for trade = trademark).
I'm now officially trademarkingthank-you™. From now on, whenever you use this word, please be sure to send me a royalty check.
Another way to protect your ideas is to (mis)use copyright law. You might think that this is a federal law designed to allow you to sue people who steal your ideas. It's not. Ideas are free. Anyone can use them.Copyrightprotects theexpressionof ideas, the particular arrangement of words or sounds or images. Bob Marley's estate can't sue anyone who records a reggae song… only the people who use his precise expression of words or music. Sure, get very good at expressing yourself (like Dylan or Sarah Jones) and then no one can copy your expression. But your ideas? They're up for grabs, and its a good thing too.
The challenge for people who create content isn't to spend all the time looking for pirates. It's to build a platform for commerce, a way and a place to get paid for what they create. Without that, you've got no revenue stream and pirates are irrelevant anyway. Newspapers aren't in trouble because people are copying the news. They're in trouble because they forgot to build a scalable, profitable online model for commerce.
Patentsare an option except they're really expensive and do nothing but give you the right to sue. And they're best when used to protect a particular physical manifestation of an idea. It's a real crapshoot to spend tens of thousands of dollars to patent an idea you thought up in the shower one day.
So, how to protect your ideas in a world where ideas spread?
Don't.
Instead, spread them. Build a reputation as someone who creates great ideas, sometimes on demand. Or as someone who can manipulate or build on your ideas better than a copycat can. Or use your ideas to earn a permission asset so you can build a relationship with people who are interested. Focus on being the best tailor with the sharpest scissors, not the litigant who sues any tailor who deigns to use a pair of scissors.","December 7, 2009","idea protection, trademark law, copyright law"
What’s it like? (The sad story of the hot pepper),"Can you imagine how difficult it was to sell the jalapeño when it came over from the new world?
""What's it like?"" you'd be asked.
Well, it's like a pepper (of course, it wasn't. Black pepper is dried and tastes very different).
Well, it's hot (no, it's not. Hot is a temperature, spicy is a taste).
It's not like anything, actually. Capsicum is an experience unto itself, and forcing me to tell you what it's like does neither of us much of a service.
""What's it like,"" is actually shorthand for, ""I don't trust you enough to just try it, so you better explain in detail what category this item fits into so I can decide in advance how to understand it.""
""What's it like?"" is a huge impediment to growth and to the spread of new ideas, because forcing a marketer to pigeonhole an idea naturally limits it.
""What's it like?"" leads to sequels and high concepts and crossovers, but it doesn't get us 1966 Bob Dylan or even yoga class.
Great marketers take advantage of categories every day. Great marketers understand how to create books or services or products or technologies that are very much like something else, but better. You should do that whenever you can.
If you want a fast start and good sales, be ready to answer the question.
When you have something that's a breakthrough, though, perhaps you need to say instead, ""It's not like anything. You need to trust me and just taste it.""","December 6, 2009","jalapeño, marketing, innovation"
The first transaction,"Do you really expect that the first time we transact, it will involve me giving you money in exchange for a product or service?
Perhaps this is a good strategy for a pretzel vendor on the street, but is that the bestyoucan hope for?
Digital transactions are essentially free for you to provide. I can give you permission to teach me something. I can watch a video. I can engage in a conversation. We can connect, transfer knowledge, engage in a way that builds trust… all of these things make it more likely that I'll trust you enough to send you some money one day. I can contribute to a project you're building, ask you a difficult question, discover what others have already learned.
But send you money on the first date? No way.

""Sure, that sounds great [insert idea here… like Free, or social media or permission or ideaviruses or empowered consumers or treating people with respect, etc.]within reason.""
It's the last two words that make it a lie.
The last two words allow you to weasel your way into failure. Within reason means, ""without bothering the boss, without taking a big risk, without taking the blame if we fail, without alienating our current retailers… be reasonable!""

Get a review copy of my new book,"[UPDATE: Our goal was reached and exceeded in just 48 hours! The site is no longer accepting donations, but you can visitAcumen's siteand donate without getting a book.]
There used to be one hundred people who mattered.
That's true in a lot of industries, but particularly in books.
One hundred people who could make a book a hit. These were key buyers at bookstores, reviewers and editors at newspapers, the person who booked time at Oprah or the Today Show.
So publishers courted these people. If the one hundred loved it, the book launched as a hit. Of course the 100 all get free copies. Lots of free copies.
Today, of course, those one hundred people matter a lot less. And who matters more?You.
You, because you have a network. You blog. You tweet. You talk things up at meetings or recommend things to friends.
And there are a lot more than a hundred of you.
One solution is to giveeveryonea free copy. Publishers and authors could do this and try to make money doing something else. Another solution is to let the best of this group, the most committed, the most interested… let them stand up and identify themselves.
So, that's what we're experimenting with onLinchpin.For a select group of motivated readers, I want to send you a copy ofLinchpin(at my expense)three weeks before anyone else can buy one.My US publisher is not sending free review copies to magazines (the few that are left), newspaper editors, TV shows, any of the usual media suspects. Instead, we're allowing people like you to raise their hands and, if they like the book, asking them to tell the world about it in January.
How to choose? I can't afford to buy a book for everyone, so I needed to come up with a filter. Here it is: The first 3,000 people who make a donation to the Acumen Fund (at least $30) get one at my expense. The money you pay goes directly to Acumen, you get the fun of making a donation and get a tax deduction before the end of the year, and I figure out which of my readers most want a copy of my book.
If you're excited about getting a first look, I hope you'll [link removed]. And thanks for your support, every day. It means a lot to me.
Please hurry, since once they're gone, I probably won't be able to offer any more.

Shocking Tiger Woods video (exclusive),"You should be careful about headlines.
It's pretty easy to write a headline that will get someone to forgive your spam, and perhaps even to open your note (CyberMonday! 85% off…). It's pretty easy to write a headline that will get someone to click through on their RSS reader. It's even easy to write a tweet that will get a click through.
But is it better to get a click and then annoy someone, or better to only reach the people who care?
The mindset of the brazen copywriter is, ""Well, even if only 1% of the people I trick are actually interested in the content, that's worthwhile. After all, there are a lot of people out there, and offending 99 to get one subscriber or one sale is good math.""
The word I use for people like this is 'spammer'.
The mindset of the modern marketer is, ""I can build a reputation in everything I do. If I teach people to trust me, then over time, I'll conserve their attention and build permission. That's priceless, particularly in a world that's getting more skeptical by the minute.""
Of course, the best thing of all is to have content that deserves a great headline. If you can't do that, though, I think you should forgo the headline.

The ipod isn’t a pod,"But the iPad is a pad. Consistency matters.
The success of theiPhone confused the naming guys at Apple. iPhone means phone + iPod. Atlaunch, the part with obvious value was the phone (we knew that) andthe iPod apps were a bonus that ended up being really terrific. Success.
The formula doesn't work in naming the iPad. We already have the ""i"" part, and we don't value the Pad part.
And,just as Apple blew it with the word 'book' (Powerbook led to Macbookbecause they didn't own the word power–IBM made them change it when the processor was changed–which led others using netbook, whichthey don't own at all), they can't own the word Pad either.

Many marketers are evangelical, focused on strangers at all costs… they'd rather convert a new customer than revisit an old one. A cubicle worker, on the other hand, might focus on no one but the boss, at the expense of broadening her platform.

Quieting the lizard brain,"How can I explain the never-ending irrationality of human behavior?
We say we want one thing, then we do another. We say we want to be successful but we sabotage the job interview. We say we want a product to come to market, but we sandbag the shipping schedule. We say we want to be thin but we eat too much. We say we want to be smart but we skip class or don’t read that book the boss lent us.
The contradictions never end. When someone shows up and acts without contradiction, we’re amazed. When an athlete just does the sport, or when a writer just writes the words, we can’t help but watch, astonished at the purity of their actions. Why is it so difficult to do what we say we’re going to do?
The lizard brain.
Or asSteven Pressfielddescribes it, the resistance. The resistance is the voice in the back of our head telling us to back off, be careful, go slow, compromise. The resistance is writer’s block and putting jitters and every project that ever shipped late because people couldn’t stay on the same page long enough to get something out the door.
The resistance grows in strength as we get closer to shipping, as we get closer to an insight, as we get closer to the truth of what we really want. That’s because the lizard hates change and achievement and risk.
The lizard is a physical part of your brain, the pre-historic lump near the brain stem that is responsible for fear and rage and reproductive drive. Why did the chicken cross the road? Because her lizard brain told her to.
Want to know why so many companies can’t keep up with Apple? It’s because they compromise, have meetings, work to fit in, fear the critics and generally work to appease the lizard. Meetings are just one symptom of an organization run by the lizard brain. Late launches, middle of the road products and the rationalization that goes with them are others.
The amygdala isn’t going away. Your lizard brain is here to stay, and your job is to figure out how to quiet it and ignore it. This is so important, I wanted to put it on the cover of my newbook. We realized, though, that the lizard brain is freaked out by a picture of itself, and if you want to sell books to someone struggling with the resistance (that would be all of us) best to keep it a little more on the down low.
Now you’ve seen the icon and you know its name. What are you going to do about it?",,"Lizard brain, resistance, human behavior"
The difference between a bonus and free,"Free is something you get, no matter what.
A bonus is something you get as an add-on when you purchase something, or trade your attention.
The purpose of free is to spread the word, alert the universe and generate interest.
The purpose of a bonus is to reward immediate action and to sway the undecided.
Here are somefreethings we built forLinchpin:
In each case, you don't have to do a thing to get started but you might decide you like it enough to spread the word. In the old days, gifts like these would cost money to create and be hard to share. Today, the opposite is true. The goal of something that's free is to spread the idea.
On the other hand, somebonusthings we built forLinchpin:
Oh, wait, I can't show them to you because you have to buy something first.
Anyway, what we did was collect:
To get them, you need to answer a simple question to demonstrate that you've ordered the new book. That's because they are bonuses, not free. And yes, you qualify even if you got the book as a gift or received it a month ago. The bonus material will only be available for a few weeks.
We also did two special deals with 800 CEO READ (that's their phone number). If you hurry, you can get abonus hardcover copyofThe Blue Sweaterwith your purchase of two copies of LInchpin. Jacqueline's breakthrough is a brilliant book that will change the way you see the world.
Or, if you'd like one of the no-longer-soldboxed sets, there are a few left, available to anyone who buys a bulk box of 50 Linchpin copies from them.
KINDLE USERS!Also, if you have a Kindle, you'll automatically get a thirty-page original essay when you buy theKindle editionat Amazon. It magically shows up on your Kindle, you don't even have to click. This is the only place you can get it. The free bonus will only be available for the next five weeks.
The best bonuses are valuable and scarce, worthy of your attention. I hope we succeeded.
Whatever you sell, whatever idea you want to spread, it's now possible to create both freebies and bonuses. One spreads, the other induces.

Jumping the gun,"There's going to be a lot of hoopla this week, some of it on this very blog (three posts already today!).
I want to be the very first author to announce a new project for Apple's tablet.
Apple is announcing the device tomorrow (I wish they had waited a week), but I thought I'd let you know early that I've licensedVookthe rights toUnleashing the Ideavirusso they can convert it into a multimedia app. It should be finished before the tablet ships, so we intend to be ready when they are.

The 2.0 media tour,"[I'll be updating this post all day, just fyi,clickthrough to see the latest update]
You know by now that I haven't gone to any traditional media for the launch of my new book – no pitches to newspapers, magazines, or television. Instead, I went directly to my readers and the many intelligent voices online. I sent review copies by request to my readers – who were generous and creative in their reviews, and now we'll hear from the bloggers and other online denizens. This is the short head of the new long tail, the group of professional and semi-pro writers and journalists that are increasing in influence daily.
I spoke to over 40 different people from various industries and blogs aboutLinchpin. I was given a warm reception by artists, business blogs, marketing sites, brand innovation sites, and creative blogs. It was a blast. My interaction with them reminds me that the online world is quickly becoming even more human and connected everyday.The page summarizing all of the links isright here.
There are a lot of people on this list, and I respect every single one of them, for their insights, their generosity and for plugging away at a medium that's just getting started.
Here's what we talked about, organized by general theme and topic. There are some overlaps, but I figured rather than talking about my book on this blog, I'd letthemlead the conversation.

Why write a book?,"If you’ve never written a non-fiction book, there are a lot of reasons why you might want to. It organizes your thoughts. It’s a big project worthy of your attention.
Noted.
But once you’vewrittena book, it’s not clear that it’s a useful thing topublishone. After all, it takes a year. It involves a lot of people. You need to print a lot of copies, ship them everywhere, create a lot of hoopla and hope that people actually a) hear about it, b) decide it’s worth the effort to track it down and c) read it and spread it.
Wouldn’t it be easier to just blog it? Or to post a PDF online and watch it spread?
Some of my books have been short… one was under a hundred pages long. It could certainly have a been a series of blog posts. And the posts might even have reached more people than the book ultimately did. If my blog posts were counted on the same metrics as bestselling books, every single one would be a New York Times bestseller. Yours too, most likely. Books don’t sell that many copies.
The goal isn’t always to spread an idea. Sometimes the goal is to make change happen. A book is a physical souvenir, a concrete instantiation of your ideas in a physical object, something that gives your ideas substance and allowsthem to travel.
Out of context, a 140 character tweet cannot change someone’s life. A blog post might (I can think of a few that changed the way I think about business and even life). A movie can, but most big movies are inane entertainments designed to make a lot of money, not change people. But books?
The reason I wroteLinchpin:If you want to change people, you must create enough leverage to encourage the change to happen.
Books change lives every day. A book takes more than a few minutes to read. A book envelopes us, it is relentless in its voice and in its linearity. You start at the beginning and you either ride with the author to the end or you bail. And unlike just about any form of electronic media, you get to read the book at your own pace, absorbing it as you go.
I published a book today. My biggest and most important and most personal and most challenging book. A book that scared me.
It took me ten years to write this book. I’m hoping it changes a few people.
Thanks.

The ubiquity of competition,"Sure, there are playoffs in football, but competition is everywhere, we just forget to notice it.
There are three hundred photographers looking for work in a particular specialty. One puts a creative commons license on his shots in Flickr and they start showing up in many places, from presentations to brochures. Which of the 300 photographers has won the competition for attention? Which one of the three hundred has shared his ideas enough to be noticed?
There are twenty towns you can choose for your family's new home. One invests in its schools, has a focus on inquiry, AP courses and community, while the others are muddling through, arguing about their future. Which one commands a higher premium for its houses?
There are a hundred new kinds of snacks and energy bars at the checkout of the supermarket. One is a little bigger, a little more exciting and a little closer to eye level. Which one of the hundred wins the battle for your impulse buy?
There are fifty people applying for a job. Forty nine have great credentials and beautifully standard layouts on their resumes. One resume was hand delivered to the CEO by his best friend, together with a glowing recommendation about a project the applicant did for the friend's non-profit.  Who gets the interview?
There are ten great jobs for the superstar programmer who is looking for a new challenge. One offers offices not cubes, free lunch, great customer support and the freedom to work on interesting projects. Where does she choose to apply?
There are 30 places that sell bumper stickers. One shows up first in the Google ads when I do a search. Which one gets my business?
There are seventy houses for sale in town. One of them is represented by a broker who is a pillar of the community, a friend of many and a role model for the industry. Which one gets more people to its open house?
There are eighty million blogs to choose from. Thanks for picking mine to read today.

The false solace of vilification,"File this one under basic human emotions that marketers need to be aware of.
When a global slowdown, national tragedy or random event hits, people look for someone to blame. If there's no one to blame, sometimes they look for someone to hate, even if it is ultimately self-destructive.
A novice computer user downloads viruses, interacts with spyware and encounters a system crash. He calls tech support for the word processor he uses and lets them have it with both barrels.
A flood hits a town and innocent people die and buildings are destroyed. The widows and bereaved families take it out on the insurance adjuster or government official who has come to help.
The economic downturn hits a town hard and some residents attack, quite personally, the hard-working school board members who had nothing to do with the bad news and in fact represent one of the best ways to ultimately recover.
In each case, the person being hated on is precisely the person who can do the most to help. And yet sometimes, we can't help ourselves. It takes significant emotional maturity to separate the event from the people in proximity to the event, and any marketer or organization that deals with the public needs to embrace the fact that just because you're close to where the bad thing happened doesn't mean it's your fault.
That software tech rep, the one who didn't cause your viruses, she's the very best person to calmly explain how to get rid of them.
That insurance adjuster might be able to get you some money to help you start to rebuild your life.
And the school board? Well if the only asset of value you still own is your house, destroying the school that gives your house its true value to a buyer seems like a version of cutting off your nose to spite your face.
I've never once heard someone say, ""things are really lousy, but I got a chance to really devastate someone today, deliver some choice barbs, some personal attacks, some baseless innuendo and ruin their day, perhaps even their career. Boy, I feel great.""
People don't remember how you behave when everything is going great. They remember how you behave when you're under pressure, stressed out and at wits end.
Emotional maturity is underrated.
PS when confronted with misplaced rage, the proper response is not to point out the misplaced part. It's to acknowledge the rage part. One big reason that vilification occurs is that the angry person feels as though not enough attention or sympathy is being paid.
The long term solution for marketers (and those that believe in civil society) is to make it socially unacceptable to vent like this. Acknowledge the rage but cease to engage, whenever possible.","January 23, 2010","Vilification, emotional maturity, misplaced rage"
"No, everything is not going to be okay","It's natural to seek reassurance. Most of us want to believe that the choices we make will work out, that everything will be okay.
Artists and those that launch the untested, the new and the emotional (and I'd put marketers into all of these categories) wrestle with this need all the time. How can we proceed knowing that there's a good chance that our actions will fail, that things might get worse, that everything won't end up okay? In search of solace, we seek reassurance.
So people lie to us. So we lie to ourselves.
No, everything is not going to be okay. It never is. It isn't okay now. Change, by definition, changes things. It makes some things better and some things worse. But everything is never okay.
Finding the bravery to shun faux reassurance is a critical step in producing important change. Once you free yourself from the need for perfect acceptance, it's a lot easier to launch work that matters.","January 22, 2010","reassurance, change, bravery"
Too much data leads to not enough belief,"Business plans with too much detail, books with too much proof, politicians with too much granularity… it seems as though more data is a good thing, because data proves the case.
In my experience, data crowds out faith. And without faith, it's hard to believe in the data enough to make a leap. Big mergers, big VC investments, big political movements, large congregations… they don't usually turn out for a spreadsheet.
The problem is this: no spreadsheet, no bibliography and no list of resources is sufficient proof to someone who chooses not to believe. The skeptic will always find a reason, even if it's one the rest of us don't think is a good one. Relying too much on proof distracts you from the real mission–which is emotional connection.","January 21, 2010","data, belief, emotional connection"
In between frames,"Scott McCloud's classicbookon comics explains a lot more than comics.
A key part of his thesis is that comic books work because the action takes place between the frames. Our imagination fills in the gaps between what happened inthatframe andthisframe, which means that we're as much involved as the illustrator and author are in telling the story.
Marketing, it turns out, works precisely the same way.
Marketing is what happens in between the overt acts of the marketer. Yes you made a package and yes you designed a uniform and yes you ran an ad… but the consumer's take on what you did is driven by what happened out of the corner of her eye, in the dead spaces, in the moments when you let your guard down.
Marketing is what happens when you're not trying, when you're being transparent and when there's no script in place.
It's not marketing when everything goes right on the flight to Chicago. It's marketing when your people don't respond after losing the guitar that got checked.
It's not marketing when I use your product as intended. It's marketing when my friend and I are talking about how the thing we bought from you changed us.
It's not marketing when the smiling waitress appears with the soup. It's marketing when we hear two waiters muttering to each other behind the serving station.
Consumers are too smart for the frames. It's the in-between frame stuff that matters. And yet marketers spend 103% of our time on the frames.","January 20, 2010","Marketing, Imagination, Transparency"
Type tells a story,"If you write it down, we're going to judge it.
Not just the words, we're going to judge you even before we read the words. The typography you use, whether it's a handwritten note or a glossy brochure, sends a message.
Some typefaces are judged in a similar way by most people you're addressing (Times Roman in a Word document or Helvetica on a street sign or Myriad Pro on a website) but even when you choose something as simple as a typeface, be prepared for people to misunderstand you.
If you send me a flyer with dated,cheesyor overused type, it's like showing up in a leisure suit for a first date. If your website looks like Geocities or some scammy info marketer, I won't even stay long enough to read it.
Like a wardrobe, I think a few simple guidelines can save amateurs like us a lot of time:
1. Invest some time and money up front to come up with a house style that actually looks the way you want it to, one that tells the story you want to tell. Hire a designer, put in some effort. A headline font, a body font, one or two extras. That's your outfit, just like the four suits you rotate through your closet.
2. ""What does this remind you of?"" No need to be a pioneer (unless that's the story you want me remember). Find a combination of typefaces that remind your chosen audience of the sort of organization you want to remind them of. Hint: italic wedding invitation fonts in the body of your email remind me of nothing except other people who have wasted my time…
3. Be consistent. Don't change it when you get bored. Don't change it when your staff gets bored. Change it when the accountant and marketing guys tell you it's not working any longer.

Unrealized projects,"When I was at MOMA last week, I saw a list of director and artist Tim Burton's projects. Here's the guy who's responsible for some of the most breathtaking movies of his generation, and the real surprise is this: almost every year over the last thirty, he worked on one or more exciting projects that were never green lighted and produced.Every year, he spent an enormous amount of time on failed projects.
A few: Catwoman, Conversations With Vincent, Dinosaurs Attack!, The Fall of the House of Usher, Geek Love, Go Baby Go, Hawkline Monster, Lost in Oz, Mai the Psychic Girl, Mary Reilly, Superman Lives, X: The Man With X-Ray Eyes.
One key element of a successful artist: ship. Get it out the door. Make things happen.
The other: fail. Fail often. Dream big and don't make it. Not every time, anyway.
Tim got his ideas out the door, to the people who decided what to do with them. And more often than not, they shot down his ideas. That's okay. He shipped.

Multiple minds,"Most people grow up with one and only one voice in our heads. It's the one that talks when we talk to ourselves. (If you have more than one voice, time to check in with a doctor). It's easy, then, to assume that this is the mind, that we have just one, one brain, one voice, one thing going on at a time.
We can demonstrate that this isn't actually true. There's the mind that gets nostalgic or excited at a photo or a smell or a sound. There's the mind that keeps us breathing. There's the mind that suddenly announces, ""I'm hungry"" after seeing a TV commercial. And most important to marketers and those that would change the status quo, there's the lizard brain, the mind that worries, particularly about survival, reproduction and rage.
When the plane lurches in turbulence, it's not your constantly running verbal mind that freaks out. It's theamygdala, the prehistoric brain stem (and the surrounding parts of the brain) that kick in. That kick leads the verbal mind to start a frightening monologue, but it was your brain stem that started it.
Marketing to just the rational mind makes no sense, because the rational mind almost never decides anything by itself. And managing your career or your day based on your irrational fears makes even less sense. Which part of your mind makes decisions about credit cards, personal security, relationships, job prospects and creativity?
As our jobs (and lives) get more cerebral and less physical, our misunderstandings about the mind (and the self-defeating miscalculations each of us make every day) become ever more important. Watch yourself for a day and start keeping store of 'who' is doing the talking and whether that part of the brain is working in your best interests or not.","January 17, 2010","Multiple minds, decision-making, marketing"
"Why you, why now?","That's really the only questions between you and a sale.
Ifsomeone is going to buy from you, is it because you're the cheapest?That's a hard thing to maintain. There better be a more sustainable reason than that.
If they're going to by from youtoday, is it because you're in proximity, the closest, the one sourcethat can satisfy the itch they happen to have? It's a little like being apeanut vendor at the ball game. You need a big crowd and you have togive up a big share of your income in exchange for being in the rightplace at the right time.
The goal is to create an offering that can answer these two questions. Why from you and why right now…
Most businesses that struggle are unableto answer these two questions in a compelling fashion. They act as though they deserve that sale, or that they need to aggressively close so you'll buy today, instead of working to build in these very elements to the product itself.","January 16, 2010","sales strategy, customer motivation, business positioning"
What the industry wants,"It's easy to get trapped wondering what consumers want, and then being frustrated when you can't get what you cook up in front of the people who want to buy it.
It's easy to forget whatindustrywants.
Supermarkets don't want unbranded fruits and vegetables, because handling is expensive and it's hard to differentiate and charge extra. On the other hand, they love nationally advertised packaged goods, because they bring in shoppers, they have promotional support, they come with shelf allowances (money for shelf space) and new skus can create excitement.
Fashion stores don't want sensible clothes that don't change from year to year. Hard to make a living doing that. They like zingy designer names and ever-changing fashion and fads. That's how they make a living.
Governments don't like buying at retail. They prefer custom stuff from high-touch organizations that can bring them the mountain, instead of the other way around. They'd rather pay 10x for an office supply that's customized just for them, instead of modifying what they want to match what the market sells. It gives them something to do. And all those salespeople! The trips, the bribes, the attention…
Doctors don't like prescribing lifestyle changes or natural cures, because many patients demand a scrip and it's easily defended and it comes with a sales rep.
If the industry can't make money selling what you're selling, why will they help you?
You can view these things as ridiculous peccadilloes. Or you can see them as parts of the system as permanent and as important as the gatekeepers who rely on them.
On the other hand, fall in love with the system and you might forget the end user. And we know how poorly that works.","January 15, 2010","industry needs, consumer preferences, market dynamics"
Update on the early Linchpin citizen reviewers,"Last month, I offered readers who wanted to review my new book achanceto get an early copy. It was a pretty big risk, because it meant ignoring the tried and true process of talking to big media and tailoring a message for critics and reviewers. What happens when you go to your best customers with a product that's untested?
Five weeks later and I couldn't be more pleased or more grateful. We sent out thousands of books (your donations raised more than $100,000 for charity) and so far, the book has been well received  (if you're still expecting one, please be patient, especially Canadians, it should arrive soon – the postal service works in mysterious ways).

Maneuverability,"We often talk about speed when describing certain kinds of businesses. Some companies are bureaucratic, slow, dysfunctional… others are fast… fast to market, fast to ship you something.
Just like a car, though, there's an alternative to raw speed. Call it maneuverability. You might still take a long time to get up to perfect cruising speed, but you can initiate a turn on a dime. I'd put Ford in this category. Obviously, it's going to be a long time before a car company is fast. It can take a year or more to get a factory up and running… there are just too many resources to manage. But how fast can a leveraged person in the organization get a decision made? How much data needs to be collected, how much proof needs to be produced, how many meetings need to be held?
In my experience, the size of the company isn't always the driving factor in this metric. It's usually the guts of senior management that matters.

Amplifying complaints,"Here's a common human trick: before you state your complaint, wind yourself up with a preface that makes your complaint even more plaintive and more vivid.
""Do you know who I am!""
""I saved up for four years for this vacation and paid your top of the line rate…""
""I've told you a million times that the most important feature was this, and in fact the only reason I bought your product was…""
""I've worked my butt off for him for years, showing up even on holidays, and now…""
You've heard it, and perhaps you've done it.
It's interesting to trick yourself by doing precisely the opposite.
""In this economy, I'm lucky to have this job, and it's almost perfect. It would be even better if…""
or
""I love owning this device, it lets me manage my life and contacts, and the one thing that would make it even better is…""
It's important to leave out the word ""but.""

Career fairs…,"are neither.
Of course they don't exist to help you plan or execute acareer. Most of the organizations with booths are bottom fishing, looking for enough willing and able employees to fill established gaps in their companies. This is hiring on the hoof, wholesale filling of average jobs with people trying to be average. Planning a career at a career fair is a little like looking for a soulmate at a singles' bar.
Andfair? Hardly. Because there are no average people, right? There are average jobs, certainly, average in that they require people to fit in, do what they're told and follow the manual. I'll grant you that those jobs need to get done, but I'm not sure they have to get done by you.
By the time a job opening hits the career fair, it's a job you don't want. And by the time a job seeker is walking down the aisles, standardized resume in hand, it might be too late for her to find a job that's worthy of her.
Here's to a new, better sort of career fair, one that's selective, interactive, long-term and both career and fair.","January 12, 2010","career fairs, job searching, career planning"
The lesson from two lemonade stands,"The first stand is run by two kids. They use Countrytime lemonade, paper cups and a bridge table. It's a decent lemonade stand, one in the long tradition of standard lemonade stands. It costs a dollar to buy a cup, which is a pretty good price, considering you get both the lemonade and the satisfaction of knowing you supported two kids.
The other stand is different. The lemonade is free, but there's a big tip jar. When you pull up, the owner of the stand beams as only a proud eleven year old girl can beam. She takes her time and reaches into a pail filled with ice and lemons. She pulls out a lemon. Slices it. Then she squeezes it with a clever little hand juicer.
The whole time that's she's squeezing, she's also talking to you, sharing her insights (and yes, her joy) about the power of lemonade to change your day. It's a beautiful day and she's in no real hurry. Lemonade doesn't hurry, she says. It gets made the right way or not at all. Then she urges you to take a bit less sugar, because it tastes better that way.
While you're talking, a dozen people who might have become customers drive on by because it appears to take too long. You don't mind, though, because you're engaged, almost entranced. A few people pull over and wait in line behind you.
Finally, once she's done, you put $5 in the jar, because your free lemonade was worth at least twice that. Well, maybe the lemonade itself was worth $3, but you'd happily pay again for the transaction. It touched you. In fact, it changed you.

More librarians are telling me (unhappily) that the number one thing they deliver to their patrons is free DVD rentals. That's not a long-term strategy, nor is it particularly an uplifting use of our tax dollars.
Here's my proposal:train people to take intellectual initiative.
Once again, the net turns things upside down. The information is free now. No need to pool tax money to buy reference books. What we need to spend the money on are leaders, sherpas and teachers who will push everyone from kids to seniors to get very aggressive in finding and using information and in connecting with and leading others.","January 9, 2010","library relevance, digital age, intellectual initiative"

Why ask why?,"The secret to creativity is curiosity.
We often forget to teach kids to be curious. A student who has no perceived math ability, or illegible handwriting or the inability to sit still for five minutes gets immediate and escalating attention. The student with no curiosity, on the other hand, is no problem at all. Lumps are easily managed.
Same thing is true for most of the people we hire. We'd like them to follow instructions, not ask questions, not question the status quo.

What every mass marketer needs to learn from Groucho Marx,"Perhaps the most plaintive complaint I hear from organizations goes something like this, ""We worked really hard to get very good at xyz. We're well regarded, we're talented and now, all the market cares about is price. How can we get large groups of people to value our craft and buy from us again?""
Apparently, the bulk of your market no longer wants to buy your top of the line furniture, lawn care services, accounting services, tailoring services, consulting… all they want is the cheapest. The masses don't want a better PC laptop. They just want the one with the right specs at the right price. It's not because people are selfish (though they are) or shortsighted (though they are). It's because in this market, right now, they're not listening. They've been seduced into believing that all options are the same, and they're only seeing price. In terms of educating the masses to differentiate yourself, the market is broken.
Fixing this is almost always a losing battle. Just because you're good at something doesn't mean the market cares any longer.
The Marx Brothers were great at vaudeville. Live comedy in a theatre. And then the market for vaudeville was killed by the movies. Groucho didn't complain about this or argue that people should respect the hard work he and his brothers had put in. No, they went into the movies.
Then the market for movies like the Marx Brothers were making dried up. Groucho didn't start trying to fix the market. Instead, he saw a new medium and went there. His TV work was among his best (and certainly most lucrative).
It's extremely difficult to repair the market.
It's a lot easier to find a market that will respect and pay for the work you can do. Technology companies have been running this race for years. Now, all of us must.
If Wal-Mart or some cultural shift has turned what you do into a commodity, don't argue. Find a new place before the competition does. It's not easy or fair, but it's true. You bet your life.
[Please note that nothing I wrote above applies to niche businesses. In fact, exactly the opposite does. You can make a good living selling bespoke PC laptops or doing vaudeville today, even though the mass of the market couldn't care a bit.

When something is scarce, it's valuable and smart people try to make more of it. So, should we be trying to make more fear?

The reason you feel most comfortable with a job (unless, like me, you're in the minority–a job would destroy my psyche) is that you've been brainwashed by many years of school, socialization and practice.

Genius is misunderstood as a bolt of lightning,"Genius is the act of solving a problem in a way no one has solved it before. It has nothing to do with winning a Nobel prize in physics or certain levels of schooling. It's about using human insight and initiative to find original solutions that matter.
Genius is actually the eventual public recognition of dozens (or hundreds) of failed attempts at solving a problem. Sometimes we fail in public, often we fail in private, but people who are doing creative work are constantly failing.
When the lizard brain kicks in and the resistance slows you down, the only correct response is to push back again and again and again with one failure after another. Sooner or later, the lizard will get bored and give up.","February 27, 2010","Genius, Creativity, Failure"

Schools like teaching compliance. They're pretty good at it.
To top it off, until recently the customers of a school or training program (the companies that hire workers) were buying compliance by the bushel. Initiative was a red flag, not an asset.
Of course, now that's all changed. The economy has rewritten the rules, and smart organizations seek out intelligent problem solvers. Everything is different now. Except the part about how much easier it is to teach compliance.","February 26, 2010","compliance, initiative, education"

Once in a lifetime,"This is perhaps the greatest marketing strategy struggle of our time:
Should your product or service be very good, meet spec and be beyond reproach or…
should it be a remarkable, memorable, over the top, a tell-your-friends event?
The answer isn't obvious, and many organizations are really conflicted about this.
Delta Airlines isn't trying to make your day. They're trying to get you from Atlanta to Salt Lake City, close to on time, less expensive the other guy and hopefully without hassle. That's a win for them.
On the other hand, when I was growing up, we used to stop in a diner in Deposit, New York to break up the long drive from Buffalo to New York City. This diner had a really engaged staff and always one practical joke or another subtly present. (I still remember the little notice on the bulletin board once, ""Henway for sale, $45. Ask cashier."") It was enough reason to drive three miles out of our way, a few times a year. My guess is that a busy traveler wouldn't be happy with the extra six minutes it took to eat there.
Most of the consumer businesses (restaurants, services, etc.) and virtually all of the business to business ventures I encounter shoot for the first (meeting spec). They define spec and they work to achieve it. A few, from event organizers to investment advisors, work every single day to create over-the-top remarkable experiences. It's a lot of work, and it requires passion.
If you ran a spa at a ski resort, which would you shoot for?
Most of the people who come aren't regulars, and most of them just want a massage, a good one, one that makes the trip a little special. I don't think most people coming by expect anything more than that.
On the other hand, you could invest in staff and training and services that would be so connected to each other and the guests, so willing to engage and to change people that it might become the sort of transcendent experience that people talk about for months.
But you can't do both at the same time. That customer who came for the on-spec service isn't going to be happy with the over the top hoopla. And so you try to compromise and do both, to please everyone. Sorry, but you can't.","February 24, 2010","marketing strategy, customer experience, service quality"
"The doormat, the jerk and the lizard brain","The best reason to be a jerk at work is that of course no one will listen to you or support you or embrace your ideas–you're a jerk.
The best reason to be a doormat at work is that in your effort to get along, to be nice, and to go with the flow, of course you won't be expected to stand up and shout, ""follow me"" when your ideas might take you in a different direction.
Both extremes are the refuge of the lizard brain, the voice of the resistance. They reward the desire to fit in, not to stand out.
""It's not my job"" is a comforting refrain when you'd like to hide out. So is, ""they all hate me and won't do what I say.""
Fear is the driver here, it's fear that pushes people in either of these two directions. That's because in between the two extremes lies responsibility and opportunity and the requirement that you actually do work that matters.
The hard part, the part that gets you rewarded, is understanding that sometimes it is best to use common sense and toe the line, while other times you are facing fear that must be overcome.

Pennies and dollars,"""Watch the pennies and the dollars will take care of themselves.""
I'm not sure this is true. In fact, I'm pretty sure that if you watch the dollars, you don't have to worry so much about pennies.
Big brands don't sweat the small expenses. They don't hassle about a return, or a little coupon fraud or the last penny per square foot on the rent in a prime location. In fact, they understand that there's a powerful honest signal sent when you don't worry about the tiny expenses. It shows confidence.
My first business was running a ski club from my high school to a nearby ski area. Most of the other clubs rented expensive coach buses. I rented school buses. That one shift saved thousands of dollars. As a result, I had plenty of money to spend on snacks for the bus, no hassles about refunds if you broke your leg… it was easy to be generous because I'd saved so much on the bus.
So many small businesspeople are crippled by their relationship with money. I know… I used to window shop at restaurants and then go home and eat Spaghetti-Os. The thing is, if you run out of money you lose the game. That's a given. But what's the best strategy for not running out of money?
I don't think the answer is to worry insanely about little expenses (saving $20 on your blogging expenses in exchange for distracting ads, for example.) In fact, too much worrying about cash is the work of the lizard brain, it's a symptom of someone self-sabotaging the work.
The thing to do is invest in scary innovations, large leaps, significant savings. Instead of renting a skimpy booth at the big trade show and scrimping on all the extras, why not rent a limo and drive the key buyers around town, or sponsor the awards luncheon? When you skimp all the time, you signal that you're struggling.","February 22, 2010","money management, business strategy, confidence"

Your most vivid fears…,"are almost certainly not the most important ones.

Moving the line (the power of a zealot),"Extremists move the middle.
Compromise is everywhere. Most of us can't possibly be pure extremists or true fundamentalists, so we draw the line somewhere in the middle.
Consider the choice of what you eat (or don't eat). It ranges from the omnivore at one end to the fruitarian at the other:
Cannibal… chimps… dogs… cats… cows… pigs… foie gras… chickens… fish… unfertilized eggs… honey… yeast… cherries… dust
My guess is that few people care so little about their role in the food chain that they're willing to eat humans (one end of the spectrum), and there are very few strict fruitarians out there (but I've never met someone who wouldn't eat yeast). Most of us draw a line somewhere between the extremes. That means we're already compromising, we just argue about how much.
Consider government:
Karl Marx… Maoist… socialist… progressive… fiscal conservative… libertarian… Ayn Rand
Again, I don't think that many people would be happy at all living at either end of the spectrum above, so we each draw a line. It's ad hoc, it's based on our community, but we pick it and then magically, we stick with it. Not just stick with our ad hoc line, but argue about it, defend it and get angry about it.
Private jet… fried baby seals… SUV…'organic' dry cleaning… Prius… bicycle… localvore… burlap sacks… No impact man
It's interesting to note that an enormous amount of apparently principled argument goes on about relatively tiny movements in where the line is being drawn. In most cases, to paraphrase an old joke, ""we've already figured out what sort of girl you are, now we're just arguing about the price."" It's not the principle, in fact, it's just the degree of compromise we're comfortable with and content to argue over.
And so it's left to the zealots. The people at either end have little hope of moving the masses all the way to their end of the argument. Instead, what they do is make it feel safer to change the boundaries, safer to recalibrate the compromise. Over time, as the edges feel more palatable, the masses are more likely to be willing to edge their way closer to one edge or another. Successful zealots don't argue to win. They argue to move the goalposts and to make it appear sane to do so.","February 20, 2010","Compromise, Extremism, Zealotry"

How to use clichés,"I love this definition from Wikipedia:
In printing, a cliché was a printing plate cast from movabletype. This is also called a stereotype.When letters were set one at a time, it made sense to cast a phraseused repeatedly as a single slug of metal. ""Cliché"" came to mean such aready-made phrase. The French word “cliché” comes from the sound madewhen the matrix is dropped into molten metal tomake a printing plate.
To save time and money, then, printers took common phrases and re-used the type.
Along the way, they trained us to understand the image, the analogy, the story. Hear it often enough and you remember it. That training has a useful purpose. Now, you can say 'Festivus' or 'There is no I in team…"" or ""that took real courage"" when describing a golf shot, and we immediately get it. Monty Python took a cliché about theSpanish Inquisitionand made it funny by making it real. The comfy chair!
The effective way to use a cliché is to point to it and then do precisely the opposite.Juxtapose the cliché with the unexpected truth of what you have to offer. Apple does this all the time. They point out the cliché of a laptop or a desktop or an MP3 player and then they turn it upside down. Richard Branson takes the expected boredom of a CEO and turns it upside down by doing things you don't expect.

Viral growth trumps lots of faux followers,"Many brands and idea promoters are in a hurry to rack up as many Facebook fans and Twitter followers as they possibly can. Hundreds of thousands if possible.
A lot of these fans and followers are faux. Sunny day friends. In one experiment I did, 200,000 followers led to 25 clickthroughs. Ouch.
Check out the graph on the left. The curves represent different ideas and different starting points. If you start with 10,000 fans and have an idea that on average nets .8 new people per generation, that means that 10,000 people will pass it on to 8000 people, and then 6400 people, etc. That's yellow on the graph. Pretty soon, it dies out.
On the other hand, if you start with 100 people (99% less!) and the idea is twice as good (1.5 net passalong) it doesn't take long before you overtake the other plan.  (the green). That's not even including the compounding of new people getting you people.
But wait! If your idea is just a little more viral, a 1.7 passalong, wow, huge results. Infinity, here we come. That's the purple (of course.)

"The brand, the package, the story and the worldview","Madecassehas a lot going for it. It's delicious chocolate. It's made in Africa (the only imported chocolate made on the continent with local beans). The guys who make it are doing good work and are nice as well.
The question I asked them is, ""does your packaging do its job?""
I don't think the job of packaging is to please your boss. I think you must please the retailer, but most of all, attract and delight and sell to the browsing, uncommitted new customer.
Let me take you through the reasoning, because I think it applies to your packaging as well.
We start with this: if I've already purchased and liked your product, the packaging isn't nearly as important. I'm talking here about packaging as a sales tool for converting browsers into buyers. (If you're already a buyer, all I need to do is remind you what we look like). If word of mouth or other factors are at work, your package matters a lot less. But for a company this size, in this market, the package matters a lot.
Now, among people who haven't bought, but might, understand that every one of them starts with aworldview. What are the beliefs and expectations and biases they have about the world?
In this case, it's about someone in the market for high end chocolate. If your worldview is, ""Hershey's is the best, it reminds me of my childhood,"" then I'd argue that this $4 bar isn't for you no matter what they do with the package.
Perhaps you believe, ""All that matters is how it tastes, and great chocolate looks a certain way,""
or perhaps, ""I care about the origin of what I buy,""
or perhaps, ""I want something out of the ordinary, unlike anything I've had before,""
or perhaps, ""Chocolate is like wine. I am interested in vintages and varietals,""
or maybe, ""Chocolate should be fun. Enough with the seriousness.""
As you can see, no package can optimize for all of these people. You can compromise your packaging, try to appeal to everyone, muddy your brand promise and hide your story. I think that's sort of what the existing packaging does and I'm not sure it's smart.
The alternative is to focus not on ALL the people in the market, but just a few. Winning hands down with 25% is plenty in this market, and perhaps in your market too.
You could figure out how to tell thedeliciousstory, by referencing (copying the style of) other products in other categories that are already seen as delicious, at least by this audience.
You could tell the snobby varietal handmade story, and that's been done many times as well.
Or you could tell a story that is yours and yours alone.
For example, the Madecasse story aboutmade by Africans in Africais very powerful, at least as powerful as fair trade, if not more (they keep four times as much money in Africa by selling a bar as they would if they just sold beans to other companies).
If that's true, then why not put your workers on the label? Big beautiful pictures that would be an amazing juxtaposition against all the other abstract stuff in the store. Tell me the story of the worker on the back. Make each one different and compelling. Packaging as baseball card. I wouldn't put a word on the front, just the picture.  Now I not only eat something that tastes good, but I feel good. You've made it personal. The story on the back is about a real person, living a better life because I took the time to buy her chocolate instead of someone else's. When I share the chocolate, I have something to say. What do you say when you give someone a chocolate bar? This package gives you something to say.
Or be fun and funny. Make the product itself almost a bumper sticker, something worth buying and talking about.

The hidden power of a gift,"If I sell you something, we exchange items of value. You give me money, I give you stuff, or a service. The deal is done. We're even. Even steven, in fact.
That's fine, but it doesn't explain potlatch or the mystery of art or the power of a gift.
If I give you something, or way more than you paid for, an imbalance is created. That imbalance must be resolved.
Perhaps we resolve it, as the ancient Native Americans did, by acknowledging the power of the giver. In the Pacific Northwest a powerful chief would engage in potlatch, giving away everything he owned as a sign of his wealth and power. Since he had more to give away, and the power to get more, the gifts carried real power, and others had to accept his power in order to engage.
Or we resolve it by acknowledging the creativity and insight of the giver. Artists do this every time they put a painting in a museum or a song on the radio. We don't pay for the idea, but we acknowledge it. And then, if it's particularly powerful, it changes us enough that we become givers, contributing to someone else, passing it along.
Sometimes we resolve the imbalance by becoming closer to the brand or the provider. We like getting gifts, we like being close to people who have given us a gift and might do it again.
And sometimes, in the case of international aid, we resent the rich giver, the one with so much more power, and thus create a cycle of dependence that does neither side any good. This sort of gift isn't much of a gift at all.
When done properly, gifts work like nothing else. A gift gladly accepted changes everything. The imbalance creates motion, motion that pushes us to a new equilibrium, motion that creates connection.
The key is that the gift must be freely and gladly accepted. Sending someone a gift over the transom isn't a gift, it's marketing. Gifts have to be truly given, not given in anticipation of a repayment. True gifts are part of being in a community (willingly paying taxes for a school you will never again send your grown kids to) and part of being an artist (because the giving motivates you to do ever better work).
Plus, giving a gift feels good.","February 11, 2010","gift, imbalance, connection"

TEDthink,"Can you factor this?
If you're like most people, you get a little queasy at the thought. And when you were in tenth grade, you surely wondered why they were bothering you.
(the answer is (x-2) times (x-2), in case you were curious.)
It turns out that the real reason you needed to do this work was to be able toplay with numbers in your head.Abstract numerical thoughtis an important skill among educated people.
Which brings us toTED, a conference held every year in Long Beach. It's going on right now.
Watch a few TED videos and try to get ahead of the speaker. They have an idea…it's probably a conceptual tricky idea, one with a lot of moving parts. And there is a lot of shorthand and arm waving … basically, it's similar to a quadratic equation. If you need the other person to slow down and explain every little bit, you've missed the point. The point is to doabstractconceptualthought. To get in practice taking the accepted status quo and questioning it, at least for a little while, at least this or that part of it.
I think this is a skill, a rare one. The ability to be facile in the manipulation of ideas, both theoretical and established, is a valuable one, and I think the TED videos and art of reading books (at least the first ten minutes of each) are two great ways to getting better at manipulation of ideas. It takes practice, and it's worth it.
I sat in a meeting last week with someone who was 100% tactical. She couldn't let go of the urgency of the moment long enough to envision a different future, even for five minutes. The abstract conceptual part was missing from her part of the conversation.
The trick is to be able to leap to, ""if we did A and B, would that get us C? Would C be a good thing? Is it possible to do A and B if we really commit?"" and then move on to the next one. And that takes practice. Why wouldn't it?

"Frightened, clueless or uninformed?","In the face of significant change and opportunity, people are often one of the three. If you're going to be of assistance, it helps to know which one.
Uninformedpeople need information and insight in order to figure out what to do next. They are approaching the problem with optimism and calm, but they need to be taught. Uninformed is not a pejorative term, it's a temporary state.
Cluelesspeople don't know what to do and they don't know that they don't know what to do. They don't know the right questions to ask. Giving them instructions is insufficient. First, they need to be sold on what the platform even looks like.
Andfrightenedpeople will resist any help you can give them, and they will blame you for the stress the change is causing. Scared people like to shoot the messenger. Duck.
The worst kind of frightened person is one with power. Someone in a mob of other frightened people, someone with a gun, someone who is the CEO. When confronted with a scared CEO, time to run. Before someone can change, they have to learn, and before they learn, they have to cease being scared.
One reason so many big ideas come from small organizations is that there is far less fear of change at the top. One mistake board members and shareholders make is that they reward the scared but hyper-confident CEO, instead of calling him on the carpet as he rages at change.
When I first encountered surfing, I was scared of it. It looks cool, but an old guy like me can get hurt. A patient instructor allayed my fears until I was willing to get started. When you first start out, the things you think are important are actually irrelevant, and it's the stuff you don't know is important that gets you thrown into the ocean. Finally, and only then, was I smart enough to actually learn.
I'm bad at surfing now, but at least I know why.

iPad app of my dreams: the digital talking pad,"Here's the spec. If you build it and it's great, I'll use it and I'll blog it.
A while ago, I posted about thetalking padand amodern versionof it.
I think there's a killer app version of this for the iPad, and I hope someone will build it. The talking pad is an interactive presentation tool for smart people.
Overview
It's a very simple concept: a collection of pages (slides, images, type, let's call them pages) that are easy to navigate in a non-linear way. Along with the standard zoom features, I'd like to be able to write on any of them in real time using my finger. I can also call up, on demand, a calculator or a blank drawing pad.
Creation
I can create the talking pad files on my Mac or on the iPad using a builder app, and sync both ways. The builder is really simple, just the ability to organize pages I create in other apps, with simple navigation, scale and type tools.
Navigation
Instead of it being linear (like Powerpoint or Keynote), the pages are arranged in a grid or checkerboard. From any page, then, I can go back, forward, up or down, and the four diagonals as well. So depending on the conversation I'm having with my audience, my 'next' page can be any of 8.
In addition, the app supports an external monitor. When I'm hooked up to the projector or screen, I see twenty or thirty of my pages in thumbnails on my ipad screen, and I can click any of them to instantly bring that page up on the projector.
In essence, I want to be able to play a presentation the same way some people play jazz piano.
As a prompt, each corner and side of the page can have little keyword reminders, so I can easily remember, for example, that pressing the bottom left corner of the page about dogs will display the page about tigers.
So now, someone asks a question and I can just jump to the slide that answers that question. If I want to circle something or zoom in, I just put my finger on the screen and do that.
Bonuses:
1. the ability to have one of the pages be a web browser with address already loaded, so if I want, without leaving the talking pad app, I can jump to this.
2. the ability to embed links within the pages, so I can actually have a page that points to other pages (this is currently built into keynote and powerpoint, but people don't use it because those programs are so linear). In essence, a page becomes a piano keyboard with each key pointing to another page.
Reporting
The app can keep track of which pages I used the most, and for how long. This is useful in a corporate setting. Imagine that the sales manager dreams up a talking pad file and offers it to 100 salespeople. Every day, when they re-sync, we can see how often the pad was used and which slides got used the most often.
The Killer App
A killer app is a program that all by itself is good enough to justify the price of the hardware. The killer app for the PC was Lotus 1-2-3. The killer app for the iPod was iTunes. This is reason enough to pay $500, I think.

Hunters and Farmers,"10,000 years ago, civilization forked. Farming was invented and the way many people spent their time was changed forever.
Clearly, farming is a very different activity from hunting. Farmers spend time sweating the details, worrying about the weather, making smart choices about seeds and breeding and working hard to avoid a bad crop. Hunters, on the other hand, have long periods of distracted noticing interrupted by brief moments of frenzied panic.
It's not crazy to imagine that some people are better at one activity than another. There might even be a gulf between people who are good at each of the two skills. Thom Hartmann haswrittenextensively on this. He points out that medicating kids who might be better at hunting so that they can sit quietly in a school designed to teach farming doesn't make a lot of sense.
A kid who has innate hunting skills is easily distracted, because noticing small movements in the brush is exactly what you'd need to do if you were hunting. Scan and scan and pounce. That same kid is able to drop everything and focus like a laser–for a while–if it's urgent. The farming kid, on the other hand, is particularly good at tilling the fields of endless homework problems, each a bit like the other. Just don't ask him to change gears instantly.
Marketers confuse the two groups. Are you selling a product that helps farmers… and hoping that hunters will buy it? How do you expect that people will discover your product, or believe that it will help them? The woman who reads each issue of Vogue, hurrying through the pages then clicking over to Zappos to overnight order the latest styles–she's hunting. Contrast this to the CTO who spends six months issuing RFPs to buy a PBX that was last updated three years ago… she's farming.
Both groups are worthy, both groups are profitable. But each group is very different from the other, and I think we need to consider teaching, hiring and marketing to these groups in completely different ways. I'm not sure if there's a genetic component or if this is merely a convenient grouping of people's personas. All I know is that it often explains a lot about behavior (including mine).

Who will save us?,"Who will save book publishing?

What means 'save'?
If by save you mean, ""what will keep things just as they are?"" then the answer isnothing will.It's over.
If by save you mean, ""who will keep the jobs of the pressmen and the delivery guys and the squadrons of accountants and box makers and transshippers and bookstore buyers and assistant editors and coffee boys,"" then the answer is stillnothing will.Not the Kindle, not the iPad, not an act of Congress.
We need to get past this idea of saving, because the status quo is leaving the building, and quickly. Not just in print of course, but in your industry too.
If you want to know who will save the joy of reading something funny, or the leverage of acting on fresh news or the importance of allowing yourself to be changed by something in a book, then don't worry. It doesn't need saving. In fact, this is the moment when we can figure out how to increase those benefits by a factor of ten, precisely because we don't have to spend a lot of resources on the saving part.

Modern procrastination,"The lizard brain adores a deadline that slips, an item that doesn't ship and most of all, busywork.
These represent safety, because if you don't challenge the status quo, you can't be made fun of, can't fail, can't be laughed at. And so the resistance looks for ways to appear busy while not actually doing anything.
I'd like to posit that for idea workers, misusing Twitter, Facebook and various forms of digital networking are the ultimate expression of procrastination. You can be busy, very busy, forever. The more you do, the longer the queue gets. The bigger your circle, the more connections are available.
Laziness in a white collar job has nothing to do with avoiding hardphysical labor. “Who wants to help me move this box!” Instead, it hasto do with avoiding difficult (and apparently risky) intellectuallabor.
""Honey, how was your day?""
""Oh, I was busy, incredibly busy.""
""I get that you were busy. But did you do anything important?""
Busy does not equal important. Measured doesn't mean mattered.
When the resistance pushes you to do the quick reaction, the instant message, the 'ping-are-you-still-there', perhaps it pays to push in precisely the opposite direction.

Self-help,"If you read a book that tries to change you for the better and it fails or doesn't resonate, then it's a self-help book.
If you read a book that actually succeeds in changing you for the better, then the label changes from self-help book to great book.
We don't like books that fail, because they waste our time, they offend us, they speak a different language or they make us feel out of sorts. Self-help books are a bane.
On the other hand, a book that resonates with us, whether it'sCatcher in the Rye, The War of ArtorZen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenanceearns a place of trust and we revere it and tell others.
A store clerk who tries to sell you something and fails is a high-pressure salesperson.
If she succeeds in selling you something, she's helpful.
The difference between the two categories isn't one of intent. They're all ultimately trying for the same thing. The difference is in success. So, go ahead and denigrate self-help books and salespeople and the rest. Just be clear with yourself that what you're unhappy with are the ones that fail.

"The reality of digital content (lose the cookie, lose the fortune?)","A magazine with a million subscribers might spend more than a million dollars to deliver a single issue to its subscribers. A million dollars spent on postage, printing, subscription sales, fulfillment, ad sales, sub rights and more. I wouldn't be surprised if the freelance budget for the writers and photographers (the real reason people read the magazine) is less than 15% of the cost, perhaps a lot less.
The economics of this business are interesting. Millions spent, millions earned, and almost all of it goes to pay for the paper and the friction it brings.
Now, we fast forward to a world, our world, where the cost of delivery is zero and so we've removed 95% of the costs.
What happens to the writers and photographers? Where do they get their money now?
Without fortune cookies, are there fortunes?
See,Gourmetmagazine or the frontlist at a midlist publisher were mostly wrapper. They were 95% fluff and overhead and only a sliver spent for the actual content. And now thewrapper, the cookie is gone.
The bad news:Conde Nast and Simon & Schuster and the other usual suspects are no longer going to pay decent wages to average writers. And average photographers aren't going to make a living shooting weddings when the guests can do almost as well and all the photos are going on flickr anyway.
The good news:There's a new job, but this job hasn't been filled yet. It's not stable enough for a publisher type to grab it. It's not boring enough for a bureaucrat. Instead, it's a job for someone with a writer's sensibility and awareness, but it requires entrepreneurship and organization.
What happens when the people with great ideas start organizing for themselves, start leading online tribes, start creating micro products and seminars and interactions that people are actually willing to pay for? It's possible that someone like (nsfw) writerSusie Brightis never again going to make a good livingjustwriting. Instead, she could make a great living coordinating, organizing, introducing and leading a thousand or ten thousand true fans. Each of them will gladly pay for the privilege, because the connections and insights and benefits she brings are worth it. She didn't wake up this morning thinking of herself as a coach or a tour leader or a concierge or a leader, but that's the niche available to her.

The problem isn't the consultant, it's the fact that if you have to search for a brand essence, you're unlikely to find one.Standing for something means giving up a lot of other things, and opening yourself to criticism. Most people in the financial services industry (or any industry, actually) aren't willing to do that, which is why there are so few Charles Schwabs in the world.First, decide it's okay to fail and to make a ruckus while failing.

Fear of philanthropy (avert your eyes),"Peter Singeris famous for posing a stunningly difficult question,paraphrased as, ""If you are walking by a pond and you see a childdrowning, do you save her? What if it means ruining a very fancy pair ofItalian shoes?"" Okay, if we assume the answer is yes, then why notspend the cost of those shoes to save 20 kids who are starving to deathacross town or the world? There's really no difference. Or by, extension, invest in research or development that solves a problem forever… The issues are proximity and attention.
My take is that most people wouldinstantly save the kid, but given the choice, probably wouldn't take theroad by the pond again any time soon. We like to avoid these situations,because these situations make us uncomfortable.
Avert your eyes.
The reporter tells you, I'm going to show you a video of the meat you're going to eat for dinner being slaughtered. Avert your eyes. Or the fundraiser says I'm going to tell you about easily avoidable suffering in the developing world. Avert your eyes…
It boils down to a simple question, ""how much is enough?"" She knows that one iPod is all she needs, but she wonders how much philanthropy is enough?  And this is a key marketing question for anyone seeking donors.
Do I have to use upallmy Italian shoes? How much is my share? …and at some point, will we end up avoiding Singer's question altogether?
If you don't giveanythingto good causes, then you define enough as zero and you have no worries about achieving 'enough'. A sad but effective strategy.
If you give money to emergencies, friends with the guts to ask and the occasional feel good moment, you've also defined 'enough' in an easily achievable way. Your gift is a reaction to inputs.
What about people who make substantial, anonymous donations to long-term causes? How do they know what's enough? How do they decide that now it's okay to go out for a fancy dinner and not send the money to the worthy cause instead? If the solution isn't clear, if it's limitless, how do they avoid the temptation of avoiding the problem by doing nothing?
Marketers at good causes have a real challenge as they try to raise money from people who aren't billionaires. As they approach people with $10,000 or $100,000 in the bank, this fear of not seeing a limit is very real, and if it's not confronted, they will fail at both raising the money and generating satisfaction for the donor.
The Mormon Church says, ""tithe"". Loosely paraphrased, they say, ""10% is a lot, and 10% is enough."" This is actually very smart, because they've created a difficult but achievable standard, a way to be a member of good standing in their tribe.
When my dad ran the local United Way drive as a volunteer, he pushed for one percent. ""One percent isn't a lot, but it's enough.""
What's enough? I don't think good cause marketers need to worry so much about which number or figure they choose, but I think they need to dream hard about whether giving people comfort with a ceiling will bring in a new class of significant donors. Too many people still avert their eyes.
PS this same thinking works for marketers trying to persuade people to join a gym, learn an instrument or go on a diet… if people can't figure out what 'enough' is, where the end lies, they may decide it's not worth starting. Sad but true.","March 26, 2010","philanthropy, enough, donor motivation"

Telling a story on the label,"Here's a $20 bottle of soap. Functionally identical to a $3 bottle, so what's the $17 for?
Let's assume the people buying it aren't stupid. What are they paying $17 for? A story. A feeling. A souvenir of a shopping expedition or perhaps just a little bit of joy in the shower every morning. Let's dissect:
1. The hang tag. It's special because most soap doesn't have a hang tag. Hang tags come on things that are a little more special than soap. And hang tags beg to be read. This one says a lot (and nothing, at the same time.) It reminds us that it doesn't contain SLS. What's SLS? Is it as bad as SLES?
2. This isn't soap. It'smineral botanic.Both words are meaningless, which means the purchaser can attach whatever feelings they choose to them. In this case, the marketer is hoping for old-time, genuine, down-to-earth and real.
3. It's not made by a soap company. It's made in a Dead Sea Laboratory. Laboratories, of course, are where scientists work, and the Dead Sea is biblical, spiritual and really salty. The company has a name (Ahava) that is onomatopoeic and reminds you of breathing. Breathe deep and find calm. [Even better, I'm told it means 'love' in Hebrew].
4. My favorite part is that it's made from bamboo and pansy. At least a little. Bamboo because it's fast growing and Asian and gentle and wood and grass at the same time. And pansy… well… pansy is for girls.
5. Two really good things here. First, it's forverydry skin. This is brilliant. If your skin is dry, you don't want to hear that it's sort of dry, kind of dry, not as dry as that guy over there… No, you want to hear that it's extremely dry, really dry, so dry it's like sand. That kind of dry. This bottle understands how very dry your skin is, and it's here to help.
Also, it's in French! I love that there's the language of love and sophistication and diplomacy right here on the bottle. I can imagine that models for Chanel are using it on the Rive Gauche as we speak.

I'm limiting the program to people at non-profits doing important work (or for-profits that leave a significantly positive impact on their communities). I know this is subjective, but I've found that people who are doing work that they're proud of have already made an important choice.
Applications are open from now until March 31st at noon EST.Late applications will be deleted unread.
For those of you that can't get to New York or want a digital version, I'm afraid that there won't be one. Most of my work is digitally available, but this is an intimate exchange of learning and ideas.
Just because it's free doesn't mean it will be easy, and just because it's short doesn't mean the lessons won't last. I truly want to help people who are doing work that matters, and this feels like a good way to do that. If this is for you, I hope you'll apply. If you can run a program like this, I hope you will. And if neither is possible, I hope you'll find some books and blog posts that help you achieve your goals.","March 22, 2010","nano-MBA, non-profit, intensive program"

Do you make slush?,"A few months ago, theJournalwrote a piece about the demise of the slush pile, that undifferentiated mass of unsolicited ideas from authors and screenwriters in search of a publisher or studio.
They missed the point.
In the words ofMichael Brooke, ""I'm not interested in creating slush.""
If you have something good, really good, what's it doing in the slush pile?
Bring it to the world directly, make your own video, write your own ebook, post your own blog, record your own music.
Or find an agent, a great agent, a selective agent, one that's almost impossible to get through to, one that commands respect and acts as a filter because after all, that's what you're seeking, a filtered, amplified way to spread your idea.

When a freelancer changes the game,"Often, businesses hire freelancers (writers, photographers, process consultants, trainers) to solve a specific problem for the lowest possible cost. And a good freelancer at the right price is often the right approach.
Sometimes, though, you spend more and get somethinggreat. You seek out and find a linchpin who combines inspiration and professionalism and initiative and pushes back on your quest for average. When you interact with someone like that, you might pay more but you get far more than you paid.
I recently did aphoto shootwith my friend Brian, and from the moment I walked into the studio, I discovered that he and his lighting guru were relentlessly pushing to change my perception of what was possible at the same time they were focused on overdelivering on the project. They had little interest in settling on merely doing a good job.
There's a lot of pressure for freelancers to fit in, conform and comply. It seems easier to generate new business that way. That's not really true. It's easier to become an easily-described commodity that way, but the person who's willing to push themselves out to an edge that matters is on the only path that actually leads to success.
And then it's up to the client to care enough about the project and in making a difference to have the guts to hire you.","March 20, 2010","freelancers, value, innovation"
First and never,"I met a new addition to the family the other day. She was eleven days old.
It was the warmest day of her whole life the day I was there. And she had just eaten her biggest meal ever.
Firstsare fun and exciting and it's neat to keep topping ourselves.
I've also come to grips with the fact that I'm never going to eat tuna ever again, and that I'm never going to be able to easily walk onto a shuttle flight at the last minute and just show up in Boston.Neveris a lot harder than first, but I guess you get used to it.
The internet is like Ice 9. It changes what it touches, probably forever. We keep discovering firsts, the biggest viral video ever, the most twitter followers ever, the fastest bestseller ever… And we constantly discover nevers as well. There's never going to be a mass market TV show that rivals the ones that came before. There's never going to be a worldwide brand built by advertising ever again either. And Michael Jackson's record deal is the last one of its kind… And there may never be a job like that job you used to have either.
Revolutions are like that. They invent and destroy and they only go one way. It's like watching a confused person in a revolving door for the first time. They push backwards, try to slow it down, fight the rotation… and then they embrace the process and just walk and it works.","March 19, 2010","Firsts, Nevers, Change"

Driveby culture and the endless search for wow,"The net has spawned two new ways to create and consume culture.
The first is the wide-open door for amateurs to create. This is blogging and online art, wikipedia and the maker movement. These guys get a lot of press, and deservedly so, because they're changing everything.
The second, though, is distracting and ultimately a waste. We're creating a culture of clickers, stumblers and jaded spectators who decide in the space of a moment whether to watch and participate (or not).
Imagine if people went to the theatre or the movies and stood up and walked out after the first six seconds. Imagine if people went to the senior prom and bailed on their date three seconds after the car pulled away from the curb.
The majority of people who sign up for a new online service rarely or never use it. The majority of YouTube videos are watched for just a few seconds. Chatroulette institutionalizes the glance and click mentality. I'm guessing that more than half the people who started reading this post never finished it.
This is all easy to measure. And it drives people with something to accomplish crazy, because they want visits to go up, clicks to go up, eyeballs to go up.
Should I write blog posts that increase my traffic or that help change the way (a few) people think?
Should a charity focus on instant donations by texting from a million people or is it better to seek dedicated attention and support from a few who understand the mission and are there for the long haul?
More and more often, we're seeing products and services coming to market designed to appeal to the momentary attention of the clickers. The Huffington Post has downgraded itself, pushing thoughtful storiesdown the page in exchange for linkbait and sensational celebrity riffs.This strategy gets page views, but does it generate thought or change?
If you create (or market) should you be chasing the people who click and leave? Or is it like trying to turn a cheetah into a house pet? Is manipulating the high-voltage attention stream of millions of caffeinated web surfers a viable long-term strategy?
Mass marketing used to be able to have it both ways. Money bought you audience. Now, all that buys you a mass market is wow and speed. Wow keeps getting harder and dives for the lowest common denominator at the same time.
Timemagazine started manipulating the cover and then the contents in order to boost newsstand sales. They may have found a short-term solution, but the magazine is doomed precisely because the people they are pandering to don't really pay attention and aren't attractive to advertisers.
My fear is that the endless search for wow further coarsens our culture at the same time it encourages marketers to get ever more shallow. That's where the first trend comes in… the artists, idea merchants and marketers that are having the most success are ignoring those that would rubberneck and drive on, focusing instead on cadres of fans that matter. Fans that will give permission, fans that will return tomorrow, fans that will spread the word to others that can also take action.
Culture has been getting faster and shallower for hundreds of years, and I'm not the first crusty pundit to decry the demise of thoughtful inquiry and deep experiences. The interesting question here, though, is not how fast is too fast, butwhat works?What works to change mindsets, to spread important ideas and to create an audience for work that matters? What's worth your effort and investment as a marketer or creator?
The difference this time is that driveby culture is both fastandfree. When there's no commitment of money or time in the interaction, can change or commerce really happen? Just because you can measure eyeballs and pageviews doesn't mean you should.
In the race between 'who' and 'how many',whousually wins–if action is your goal. Find the right people, those that are willing to listen to what you have to say, and ignore the masses that are just going to race on, unchanged.","March 16, 2010","Driveby culture, attention economy, meaningful engagement"
But it’s better than TV,"At the local health food store lunch buffet, they offer stir fried tempeh.

We can do it,"Too often, it seems, this attitude is missing from teams, organizations or the community.
It's missing because people are quick to opt out of the 'we' part. ""What do you mean, we?"" they ask. It's so easy to not be part of we, so easy to make it someone else's problem, so easy to not to take responsibility as a member of whatever tribe you're part of.
Sometimes it's missing because people disagree about what 'it' is. If you don't know what you're after, it's unlikely you're going to find it.
And it's missing because people confuse cynicism with realism, and are afraid to say ""can"". They'd rather say 'might' or even 'probably won't'.
Just about everything worth doing is worth doing because it's important and because the odds are against you. If they weren't, then anyone could do it, so don't bother.
Product launches, innovations and initiatives by any organization work better when the key people agree on the goal, believe that they can achieve it and that the plan will work.
Do we have a cynicism shortage? Unlikely.

Helping spread the word,"SinceLinchpinwas published six weeks ago, I've gotten some terrific email. Most of it is about individuals who used the ideas in the book to instigate a process of self-reinvention or validation. Some of the best mail, though, has come from managers and leaders who are using the book to inspire others. One company bought 800 copies for its management, while another reader told me how two copies helped change the way her organization coped with change.
When I find a book that moves me, I spread it to everyone who's willing to listen. I hope you feel the same way.
It's ever more clear to me that an author has very little chance of writing a book that goesdirectlyto a large number of new readers who become book buyers. There's not enough time or money or leverage to get in front of a stranger and say, ""here, read this!""
On the other hand, that's exactly what someone like you can do. ""Here, read this, and then let's discuss it…"" In fact, I'd argue that just about every book that has made an impact has spread in exactly that way.
Given that truth, here are two ways I'd like to support you if you think the ideas inLinchpinare worth spreading:
Plan 1: FIVE PACK WITH A READER'S GUIDE

We're working with800 CEO Readto offer the following: buy five copies of Linchpin and we'll send you adigital ten-page reader's guide. Packed with questions and ideas dreamed up by fellow readers that you can use to inspire or guide group conversations.
Buy five, give them away, have a conversation, make change. (PDF will be sent by email to arrive before your books do). I think you'll be delighted at the impact five books can have on the people you work with or teach.
Plan 2: LEADERSHIP TRAINING
I'm going to do alive session in New Yorkon April 16, 2010. Instead of charging my usual fee for tickets, I'm offering seats only to people interested and able to train lots of others. If you're a manager, a coach, a teacher, the leader of an organization or someone who has the desire to teach a group about the ideas in Linchpin, I'd love to have you come.
The entire session will be focused on how to talk about and spread the ideas in the book. Because it's a small group, seats are limited and are reserved for people who can buy fifty or more copies of the book from the retailer of your choice.All the details are here.We'll accept applications until all the seats are allocated, so hurry.
Thanks to each of you who have read the book and hugs to those of you touched enough by it to want to share it with others. I appreciate it. Your support made it aNY Timesbestseller, #1 in theJournal, etc., but I'm far more satisfied that it has helped people do something that they've always wanted to do.Thanks for making something happen.","March 11, 2010","Linchpin, self-reinvention, leadership training"

The Wordperfect Axiom,"When the platform changes, the leaders change.
Wordperfect had a virtual monopoly on word processing in big firms that used DOS. Then Windows arrived and the folks at Wordperfect didn't feel the need to hurry in porting themselves to the new platform. They had achieved lock-in after all, and why support Microsoft?
In less than a year, they were toast.
When the game machine platform of choice switches from Sony to xBox to Nintendo, etc., the list of bestelling games change and new companies become dominant.
When the platform for music shifted from record stores to iTunes, the power shifted too, and many labels were crushed.
Again and again the same rules apply. In fact, they always do. When the platform changes, the deck gets shuffled.
Think this only applies to software?
The platform for healthcare changed from independent doctor's offices and small practices to hospitals and hmos.
The platform for TV changed from airwaves to wires (so HBO and ESPN win, NBC loses).
The platform for cars is changing from gas engines to alternatives.
And the platform for books is changing (fast!) to e-books and readers. Just published today:the Vook multimedia production ofUnleashing the Ideavirus.The price will increase to $5 in two weeks, but right now it's 99 cents. It runs on the web and on youriphone[trythis linktoo] (and the iPad on April 3rd.)
Here's the thing: Vook abridged it, built it, filmed it and distributed it in less than ninety days. They have a software application that they can use again and again for other titles. They've organized themselves to be profitable at a profit margin that few big book publishers can match.
Once again, the platform changes. Insiders become outsiders and new opportunities abound.","March 10, 2010","platform shift, market dominance, disruption"
The factory in the center,"Old time factories had a linear layout, because there was just one steam engine driving one drive shaft. Every machine in the shop had to line up under the shaft (connected by a pulley) in order to get power.
That metaphor extended to the people working in the factory. Each person was hired and trained and arranged to maximize output. The goal was to engage the factory, to feed it, maintain it and have it produce efficiently.
Distribution was designed in sync with the factory. You wanted to have the right number of trucks and drivers to handle whatever the factory produced and to get it where it needed to go.
Marketing was driven by the factory as well. The goal of marketing was to sell whatever the factory could produce in a given month, for as much money and as little overhead as possible.
And things like customer service and community relations were expenses, things you did in order to keep the factory out of trouble.
So…
What happens when the factory goes away?
What if the organization has no engine in the center that makes something. What if that's outsourced? What if you produce a service or traffic in ideas? What happens when the revolution comes along (the post-industrial revolution) and now all the value lies in the stuff you used to do because you had to, not because you wanted to?
Now it doesn't matter where you sit. Now it doesn't matter whether or not you're adding to the efficiency or productivity of the machine. Now you don't market to sell what you made, you make to satisfy the market. Now, the market and the consumer and idea trump the system.
Suddenly, the power is in a different place, and the organization must change or else the donut collapses.

Five minutes to write a blog post that changes everything, or five minutes to deliver an act of generosity that changes someone.

Most organizations now have it backwards. The factory, the infrastructure, the systems, the patents, the process, the manual… that's king. In fact, shareholders demand it.

Mystery novelists stick to the center of the road, because that's where the road is. Movies are written and released in order to win an Oscar. Once there's a category, a ranking, a place to battle for supremacy, we run for it.
Do you go to trade shows or enter markets or submit RFPs or push for a GPA or even gross ratings points because there's a list of winners or because it's what you actually want to do? Most bestseller lists and prizes measure popularity, not effectiveness.

On self determination,"I posted this eight years ago (!) but a reader asked for an encore.
…are we stuck in High School?
I had two brushes with higher education this week.
The first was at a speech I gave in New York. There were severalHarvard Business School students there, invited because of theirinterest in marketing and exceptional promise (that's what I wastold… I think they came because they had heard that Maury Rubin wouldmake a great lunch!).
Anyway, they asked for my advice in finding marketing jobs. When Ishared my views (go to a small company, work for the CEO, get a jobwhere you actually get to make mistakes and do something) one womanprofessed to agree with me, but then explained, ""But those companiesdon't interview on campus.""
Those companies don't interview on campus. Hmmm. She has just spent$100,000 in cash and another $150,000 in opportunity cost to get anMBA, but…
The second occurred today at Yale. As I drove through the amazinglybeautiful campus, I passed the center for Asian Studies. It reminded meof my days as an undergrad (at a lesser school, natch), browsingthrough the catalog, realizing I could learn whatever I wanted. Thatnot only could I take classes but I could start a business, organize aprotest movement, live in a garret off campus, whatever. It was atremendous gift, this ability to choose.
Yet most of my classmates refused to choose. Instead, they treatedcollege like an extension of high school. They took the most mainstreamcourses, did the minimum amount they needed to get an A, tried not toget into ""trouble"" with the professor or face the uncertainty of theunknowable. They were the ones who spent six hours a day in thelibrary, reading their textbooks.
The best part of college is that you could become whatever youwanted to become, but most people just do what they think they must.
Is this a metaphor? Sure. But it's a worthwhile one. You have morefreedom at work than you think (hey, you're reading this on companytime!) but most people do nothing with that freedom but try to get anA.
Do you work with people who are still in high school? Job seekersonly willing to interview with the folks who come on campus? Executiveswho are trying to make their boss happy above all else? It's prettyclear that the thing that's wrong with this system is high school, notthe rest of the world.

Open buying and open selling,"If I can sell you something without a sales call or expensive ad campaign, I can sell it cheaper.
If you want to buy a business development relationship but you're not willing to negotiate, do contracts and invest a lot of time, you're going to get a lesser deal.
It seems like a paradox, but it's not.
Firefox is free, largely because it doesn't cost anything for them to 'sell' it to you. If they had to meet with your IT guys and build case studies and fly people out to conferences and take you to fancy dinners, you'd pay a lot for that friction.
When the customer does a lot of work for the seller, the seller can afford to sell it cheaper. If you drive to the customs warehouse and pick up that rug that just arrived, you can bet it's a lot cheaper.
Amazon offers affiliates a fairlylousy deal. The reason is simple: it's easy. Easy to sign up, easy to get paid, no real hoops or hassles. The openness of doing the deal is a benefit of signing up with them, and so you get paid less in exchange.
If you answer a classified about making money from home stuffing envelopes, is it any wonder you're not going to get paid much? If it's really easy to get a job, the job probably isn't worth much.
In every market, there's an opportunity to create a more open sales channel and lower your price as a way of making sales.
And in many markets, there's an opportunity to offer people a cheap way to affiliate with you and keep a bigger piece of the pie in exchange.

Which was great, except there were 1800 questions in a batch, which meant 18 wrong each time, which was totally and completely unacceptable. These were honest mistakes, made by smart people working as hard as they could.
No matter how hard we tried, we couldn't do better than 99%. So we switched our system completely and did it in a totally different way. Same number of people, same number of hours, 100% accuracy.

Many people are unable to put their finger on it, but this is a magnetic trait for many of us. We want our lawyer, dentist and waiter to demonstrate sprezzatura, but of course, not particularly try to. This is one of the secrets of Danny Meyer's top-rated restaurants in New York. It doesn't have to be flashy, it doesn't even have to be the very best there ever was, but sprezzatura is enough to get us to return.

David's eyes flashed, he turned his shoulders, muttered something and rushed away.
What did I say? What did I do? Why he is upset with me?
Of course, David Byrne isn't angry with me. David Byrne doesn't even remember who I am. In fact, David Byrne was busy, or late, or trying to figure out where he was supposed to go next. The last thing he wanted to do was patiently spend a few minutes figuring out who I was and then a few more minutes making promises he wouldn't be able to keep.

The coming melt-down in higher education (as seen by a marketer),"For 400 years, higher education in the US has been on a roll. From Harvard asking Galileo to be a guest professor in the 1600s to millions tuning in to watch a team of unpaid athletes play another team of unpaid athletes in some college sporting event, the amount of time and money and prestige in the college world has been climbing.
I'm afraid that's about to crash and burn. Here's how I'm looking at it.
1. Most colleges are organized to give an average education to average students.
Pick up any college brochure or catalog. Delete the brand names and the map. Can you tell which school it is? While there are outliers (likeSt. Johns,Deep SpringsorFull Sail) most schools aren't really outliers. They are mass marketers.
Stop for a second and consider the impact of that choice. By emphasizing mass and sameness and rankings, colleges have changed their mission.
This works great in an industrial economy where we can't churn out standardized students fast enough and where the demand is huge because the premium earned by a college grad dwarfs the cost. But…
2. College has gotten expensive far faster than wages have gone up.
As a result, there are millions of people in very serious debt, debt so big it might take decades to repay. Word gets around. Won't get fooled again…
This leads to a crop of potential college students that can (and will) no longer just blindly go to the 'best' school they get in to.
3. The definition of 'best' is under siege.
Why do colleges send millions (!) of undifferentiated pieces of junk mail to high school students now? We will waive the admission fee! We have a one page application! Apply! This is some of the most amateur and bland direct mail I've ever seen. Why do it?
Biggest reason: So the schools can reject more applicants. The more applicants they reject, the higher they rank in US News and other rankings. And thus the rush to game the rankings continues, which is a sign that the marketers in question (the colleges) are getting desperate for more than their fair share. Why bother making your education more useful if you can more easily make itappearto be more useful?
4. The correlation between a typical college degree and success is suspect.
College wasn't originally designed to merely be a continuation of high school (but with more binge drinking). In many places, though, that's what it has become. The data I'm seeing shows that a degree (from one of those famous schools, with or without a football team) doesn't translate into significantly better career opportunities, a better job or more happiness than a degree from a cheaper institution.
5. Accreditation isn't the solution, it's the problem.
A lot of these ills are the result of uniform accreditation programs that have pushed high-cost, low-reward policies on institutions and rewarded schools that churn out young wanna-be professors instead of experiences that turn out leaders and problem-solvers.
Just as we're watching the disintegration of old-school marketers with mass market products, I think we're about to see significant cracks in old-school schools with mass market degrees.
Back before the digital revolution, access to information was an issue. The size of the library mattered. One reason to go to college was to get access. Today, that access is worth a lot less. The valuable things people take away from college are interactions with great minds (usually professors who actually teach and actually care) and non-class activities that shape them as people. The question I'd ask: is the money that mass-marketing colleges are spending on marketing themselves and scaling themselves well spent? Are they organizing for changing lives or for ranking high? Does NYU have to get so much bigger? Why?
The solutions are obvious… there are tons of ways to get a cheap, liberal education, one that exposes you to the world, permits you to have significant interactions with people who matter and to learn to make a difference (starthere). Most of these ways, though, aren't heavily marketed nor do they involve going to a tradition-steeped two-hundred-year old institution with a wrestling team. Things like gap years, research internships and entrepreneurial or social ventures after high school are opening doors for students who are eager to discover the new.
The only people who haven't gotten the memo are anxious helicopter parents, mass marketing colleges and traditional employers. And all three are waking up and facing new circumstances.","April 29, 2010","higher education, college decline, educational reform"
Carrying capacity,"An organization with eight people in it might be happy, profitable and growing. The same business with twenty might be on the way to bankruptcy.
Ideas, markets, niches and causes have a natural scale. If you get it right, you can thrive for a long time. Overdo it and you stress the inputs.
The earth has a carrying capacity, certainly. It might change as a result of technology (we know how to grow food more efficiently than we did a century ago) but in any moment of time, there's a limit beyond which degradation kicks in. I don't think many would say that we currently have a people shortage. (Impossible to pull off, but worth considering: what if we skipped a growth cycle in the population and everyone in a generation had just two kids? Or even one…)
Your industry might have room for six or seven well-paid consultants, but when you try to scale up to 30 or 40 people on your team, you discover that it stresses the market's ability to pay.
Interesting note: there's also the common problem of under-staffing. More lawyers in a market might create more lawsuits. More effective ad vehicles certainly create more advertising. More lanes on the highway have been demonstrated to lead to more people commuting to work. Sometimes, adding capacity is exactly the right strategy if your goal is to add more revenue.
The next time you find your business struggling, take a minute to think about scale. More people (or fewer) might be the simplest way to solve your problem.","April 28, 2010","Carrying capacity, scale, business growth"
Transcript of the first Linchpin session,"[transcribed by: TTE Transcripts Worldwide, Ltd. www.ttetranscripts.com]

Sven was nice enough to transcribe this talk. The audio and other details arehere.

I was driving through a developing country in the Caribbeannear the water, and I passed a device I’d never seen before, which is agas-powered sugar cane juice extractor.And it looks like one of those things they put trees in after astorm.And they put sugar cane inand out the bottom comes sugar juice.

Sothe question is, if you‘re the only guy on the island who has one of thesemachines, who has the power?Obviously, you do.Thesugar cane growers have only two choices: grow sugar cane, or don’t grow sugarcane.But if they grow sugar cane,they have to sell it to you because there’s nobody else who has the machine,which means that you will pay them as little as you can as long as they keepgrowing it.And you will extractall the profit from selling that to the people who need it.

Now,what happens when three new machines come to the island?And now there are four people who havethe sugar cane processing machine.Who has the power?Thepower has shifted, hasn’t it?Youhave very little power.You are acommodity processor.The sugarcane growers still don’t have that much power because their choices are onlygrow it or don’t grow it, but the price they’re going to get is going to go upa bit, because other people can bid for it.

Butbasically, the power mostly shifts to that consumer who doesn’t care which kindof sugar cane juice they buy, and so you’re going to have to sell it cheap ifyou want to get market share.

Thenone of the guys who has the machine stops making ordinary sugar canejuice.He starts treating thegrowers better and encouraging them to not use pesticides.Now his – he’s organic.He starts treating the customersbetter, delivering more reliably in packaging that’s more suitable to what theyneed.He invests all sorts of wayto use sugar cane and process sugar cane and come up with clever sugar caneproducts.He connects to peoplewho buy sugar cane and the restaurateurs and the chefs and things so they canwork with each other to do better stuff with his organic sugar cane and theypay more for it.

Whowins now?And the answer obviouslyis the customers, the organic growers, and the guy who’s an artist when itcomes to using his machine.Asopposed to people who just say, “I just follow the manual.”And the lesson, of course, is that noweverybody has a sugar cane machine, that now, anybody who wants to makesomething over and over again, is going to be competing against other peoplewho want to make something over and over again.There is no competence shortage.And if all you have is competence to offer, why on earthwill we pay you extra?

Soif you’re a machinist, making a widget that goes in a 747, congratulations forhaving a good union.Both overtime, intelligent people – capitalists – will buy that widget from someone whowill sell it to them for one tenth of the price.

Because if all it is is a widget, just like every otherwidget, just buy the cheap one.They’re all the same.Ifall you are is a replaceable cog in the system that makes the widgets, andthere are a hundred people as competent as you around the world, you might getaway from it for a little while, but you’re not going to get away with it inthe long run.

Andthat is the challenge.So beforewe go into the six elements that I think we need to focus on when we’reteaching people about this, I want to talk about something that I saw – Ivisualized – just yesterday, that I help really help you see what a Potemkinvillage, what a façade we’ve been living in.

Sevenhundred years ago, no one was unemployed.The idea of being unemployed was totally alien. The idea of a job ispretty brand new.And there arecountries today where people don’t have jobs and don’t consider themselvesunemployed.That was put onus.

How did that happen?Here’s what happened.Twohundred years ago, people invented machines – three hundred years ago, hundredand fifty years ago – the industrial age really kicked into power.What he machine does is it allows theperson who owns the machine – like the sugar cane processing machine – allowsthe person who owns the machine to get an enormous upside because it helpstheir productivity.

But if you own the machine, you know what you need?You need people to run it.And that means you need to sell theworld on having a job.And itturns out that wasn’t that easy.

Clay Shirky has talked about an author who’s pointed thatgin was one of the key elements of the industrial revolution.That two generations, thirty years,people were drunk all day long.That if you went to Manchester, England, you’d see all the guys workingin the mills and you’d see a guy pushing a cart.

I have a picture of one – a guy pushing a cart thatdispensed gin all day long.Because this act of saying you have to go, move to a new place, walkinto a dark building, spend 12 hours there doing what you’re told and then gohome was alien.

So you needed to have people to do jobs.Why?Why would you do a job?I know, so you could have money.What do you need money for?So you can buy stuff.That was new, too.Therefore,most people the act of buying stuff was not a thing you spent a lot of timethinking about or doing.You hadthe things that you needed and every once in a while you’d have to fix them orreplace them, but you didn’t go to the mall on Saturday.That was all brand new.That was invented by the people who hadfactors that made stuff that they wanted to sell you.

Why buy stuff?Peer pressure.Keeping upwith the Joneses.That once peoplearound you have stuff, you want more stuff. And if you look at charts ofhappiness by culture, we see that there’s no correlation between stuff andhappiness.In fact, there’s areverse correlation because if lots of people in your culture have stuff, youmight be unhappy because you don’t have as much stuff as they do.Apologies to George Carlin.

It gets even worse because sometimes someone who might beworking would say, “I have enough stuff.”And they’d stop working.Soyou know what we invented?Debt.Debt has two reallygood uses when you’re talking about consumers.Use number one is that you can sell people more stuff whenthey don’t even have money.

Use number two is once they buy the stuff, they have to goto work because otherwise, debt will take all the stuff away.So that amplifies it even further,which leads to more compliance, more people doing the job, so that the factorythe machines works better, and then to cap it all off, we have school.

And school is 12 years of publically-financed brainwashingto teach people to be compliant to get them really good at taking notes, reallygood at following instructions, and in fact, when you get to work – and this isimportant – when you get to work, pretty much the only skill you use that youlearned at school is compliance.You don’t use geometry, you don’t use conjugating verbs in Latin – godown the list of all the things you spent all those hours working on in school– you don’t use any of them.

What you use is you got really good at being compliant anddoing a job – at doing your work because – that doing your job – because theytold you you have to do it.

Okay.So thissystem got put into place.And nowpeople are showing up, people like me, and we’re saying, “Wait a minute, JerryWeintraub is the future, not that person on American Airlines.”We don’t have a compliance shortage.

The United States isn’t struggling economically latelybecause we’re not obedient enough.The reason for the struggle is there aren’t enough people acting likeJerry Weintraub.There aren’tenough people who are looking at a situation where there is no map, where thereis no way to know for sure what to do next and doing things that matter.Why is that?

Aside from the brainwashing, aside from the debt, aside fromthe system, I think a big reason is the following: you’re not as good as youthink you are.When I say that toyou – you’re not as good as you think you are – my guess is that if you’re abreathing human being, I struck a nerve.No one wants to be told that.And in fact, I didn’t say it to you, I said it in quotes.Someone else was saying that toyou.

We live in fear – petrified – that someone’s going to say tous, “You know what, Bob/Jack/Jill/Sue?You’re not as good as you think you are.Who do you think you are, acting like this?Who gave you the authority?Who gave you the permission to go dothat thing that’s not written down?Where’s your deniability?Where’s you excuse?How canyou possibly justify what you did?You’re not nearly as good as you think you are.”

But no one ever says that to us.We just worry that they’re going to say that.And the worry gets amplified by school,by spouses, by in-laws, by debt, by the system, by the media – that’s whatwe’re worried about because it’s brought out large.Someone does some small misbehavior during a speech duringthe Academy Awards and we go, “Oh my God, that could’ve been me, everyonewould’ve made fun of me.”

Okay, so let me talk about the six reasons why I think thisis hard for people and what we need to do to train them to think about it.The first one – the one I’ve sort ofwarmed up with so far today – is they don’t necessarily understand what’s atstake.That I needed to spend halfthe book – the first of Linchpin – explaining the change.

I couldn’t just say “that’s a given” in one page and spendthe rest of the book on the other stuff.Because if we don’t make it clear to people what’s at stake, if it’s notmore scary to ignore that than to ignore the current fear, we’ll just live withthe current fear, thanks very much, the current fear’s just fine with me.That change often gets made when we seethat what was on the table matters.

The second thing is the entire capitalist system I describedto you does not include the word generosity.The mindset of generosity is “I need to give something tosomeone and get nothing in return.”We don’t teach very much of that.We don’t have very many examples of people who are good at that.We are not trained to do that, but youcan’t do the work that I’m talking about unless you’re prepared to be generous.Generous is spirit, generous insubstance, generous in behavior, generous in the way you’re sharing yourheart.

The third thing is recognizing that anyone can do this.Because the lizard brain – the voice inthe back of our head – might say that some people can do it, but youcan’t.It’s really good at sayingthat and there’s a good reason for it because if you believe you can’t do it,you’re not on the hook to do it, and if you’re not on the hook to do it, you’resafe.

Smart people have a really hard time with this.Some of the email I’ve been getting isstunning to me.“Are you saying”they say, “that anyone is capable of having a ____ idea?” – whatever onethey’re talking about – “are you saying that it doesn’t matter what countryyou’re from or what race you are or what your parents did for a living, thatit’s possible to do original, interesting, generous work?”Yes, I am.

No, there’s no chance I will ever be a professional pingpong player.Or golfer or cricketplayer or even be good at spreadsheets because it’s too late.But I’m also saying that when you werefour, you did something amazing that was an act of genius that no one had everdone before.And when you were sixor even eight you did it.

But then somewhere along the way, you decided that peoplemight say you don’t have the right to do that.Or they might laugh at your or they might say that you didit wrong and bad things happen.And it’s easier to just not undo it because all the other parts of thesystem – the debt and the school and the compliance and the factor and the joband the business school and the resume and the HR people – have reinforced thismodel that says your job is to do your job and we have no problem at allrewarding people for doing their job.

We try to reward them with money because it’s safer and lesspersonal.But we don’t have anyreal problem with it.And when westart talking about rewarding people for getting in touch with the fact thatthey’re actually a genius, it starts feeling really touchy feely.That didn’t use to be that way.But we invented this whole construct ontop of it.

The next one is acknowledging the fact that you have alizard brain.A physical part ofyour brain whose job it is to make you scared.Whose job it is to have you back off.A Steve Pressfield calls it, “theresistance.”The voice of thelizard is the resistance.It isreal; we can see it on a functional MRI scan of the brain.

It is not difficult at all to trigger.There’s a lot of thinking about what wedo when it gets triggered, but one thing I will tell you is it always tastesthe same.It always feels thesame. There may be a thousand reasons the resistance doesn’t want to dosomething – there may be a hundred things the lizard brain doesn’t want you todo – but it doesn’t have a large vocabulary, so when any of them show up, italways feels the same.

It doesn’t matter if you’re a shy person, whether you’reabout to meet a really important executive or just someone at a cocktail party– the same feeling is in the back of your head about what could go wrong.That’s proof that this cycle is there –it’s organic, it’s real.

We have to acknowledge it and figure out what we’re going todo about it as opposed to just pretending that there’s this little man in ourhead who makes all the decisions because if we’re going to be in charge of whatwe do next, we’re going to have to understand the geometry of that.

Two more.Stevealso gave me this great expression called “turning pro.”What that means is that there’s adifference between amateurs who are muddling their way through, doing what theyfeel like, looking for inspiration, and maybe doing good work.And professionals who show up and dothe work.

pro golferpractices even if it’s cold and rainy.A pro psychologist is able to empathize with a patient even when theydon’t feel like it.That a protrainer or coach is able to do the work and have the difficult conversationbecause it’s their job.When westart taking it seriously – when we treat that job the way we treat our currentjob – we discover we’re capable of doing a lot of things that we tended toavoid because we made it easy for the resistance.

We made it easy for the lizard to not let us do those thingsbecause it’s just a hobby -well, it’s just a bonus – it’s an extra, it’s athing on top.I have deniability,I don’t have to redesign the packaging, it was the ad agency’s fault, I’ve onlybeen here 12 weeks, spare, part-time, don’t worry about it.But if you’re a pro, then we get to thesixth thing which is your ship.

And we can talk about shipping the entire day if you wantto.But the act of shipping it outthe door, of hitting publish, of sending in the proposal, of actually closingthe funding for your company, of having that meeting with your boss, of doingthe difficult conversation – the act of making a product or service that peoplechoose to talk about – shipping it out the door is what we have a scarcityof.That’s what we have a shortageof, not compliance, but of people who will do the difficult work ofshipping.

And it’s easy if you’ve done 11 editions of that Sundayschool reader.To do the 12thedition, that doesn’t count as shipping.That’s just a revision.That’s just doing your job.What I’m talking about is putting something out the door that peoplemight not like.And there arethree reasons you might not choose to ship.And the order is important.

Reason number one is fear, and we’ve talked about that.Reason number two is using the Buddhistterm “prajna” you might not be able to have an understanding of the world as itis.You might not be able to seethe situation in front of you clearly, and so you’ll do the wrong things to getit out the door.

And the third reason is maybe you don’t have enough skill todo it well, but the order is important.Because all we focus on is the skill.We don’t focus on the first two.Let’s pick copyrighting for an example.All of us are fairly verbal.We can speak clearly for 20, 30, 40minutes in a row without notes if we’re having a conversation with a friend.

And yet, when the boss says, “Write two paragraphs thatexplain what we do for a living”, panic sets in, right?And we start reading all these blogsand books and … conversations, “Well, I’m bad at copyrighting, I’m just not agood writer.”Yes, but you’re agood talker, what happened in between the talking and the writing?Is it that you don’t know how to hold apencil?That you don’t know how totype?I don’t think so.

The two reasons you might not actually be able to ship thatparagraph back to your boss is one, you’re afraid that the boss might look youin the eye and say, “How dare you, this is terrible.”Or two, you might not be able to see the world accuratelyand accurately express what it is you need to say.But if you did see the world accurately, and you weren’tafraid, this is a two-minute assignment.But you learned in second grade not to treat it like that.In second grade you learned that whenyou have to hand in that homework assignment it might come back with red marksall over it and it’s not going to lead to much upside but it could lead to alot of downside.

So I guess what happens is there are some people if you givethem a mile, they’re going to take an inch.If you give people this opportunity to do that art, to makethat change happen, to have an impact, they’ll figure out how to minimizeit.They’ll figure out how to makeit a smaller opportunity.They’llfigure out how to look for less.

Why on each would we choose to do that?The answer seems pretty simple.The answer is because it’s safer.The answer is because in the short run,making, as Zig Ziglar would say, the frying pan smaller lowers the bar on thesize of the fish you need to catch.And this is why so many people who call themselves entrepreneurs reallyaren’t.

This is why it’s so difficult for somebody to start abusiness that really grows.It’swhy every time you look at a 6-year-old or an 8-year-old or a 12-year-old, whatwe’re seeing is someone whose been trained over and over and over again to pushfor smaller assignments, to figure out how to hand stuff in at the very lastminute.To whenever possible, gofor the inch instead of the mile.Because the mile is the scary part.

Let me shift gears here for just a minute.And I want to talk instead of economicsand I want to talk a little bit about joy.And I want to talk about what is it that you do that youlove?I think we can agree thatwhat we like is to go to work, do our job, get a pat on the back and gohome.We’ve been trained to likethat and a lot of people like it.

But what do we love?What are the things that we do during the day that we actually love todo?That we’re going to remember aweek or a month or a year later?Is there anything wrong with getting money for doing the things that youlove?Does it corrupt it if you’regetting paid to do it?And isthere enough money so that you could be bought off to do not things that youlove?

And when we have this thing of art connecting with thisthing of commerce, we get really confused.We get really confused because money isn’t just thispaper.Money stands for anenormous amount in our lives.Andwhen we can sacrifice our art for what we think is a safe opportunity to havemoney, so often that’s exactly what we do.

Whereas if you find somebody like Spike Lee who lived onmacaroni and cheese and credit cards for years instead of doing what he wassupposed to after film school, by lowering his need for money, he raised hisability to do art.And ever sincethen, he’s been able to do what he wanted to do instead of doing what he had todo.So he paid this price in termsof security, in terms of fitting in.And in exchange, he got to do the work that he wanted to.

You’re going to have to make a choice.Your clients are going to have to makea choice.Your team is going tohave to make a choice.What yourcompany does for a living has to make a choice.And the choice is this: either you break rules or you followrules.Those are the choices.There doesn’t seem to be a lot ofmiddle ground.

You can say well mostly we follow the rules, but every oncein a while we break them.But ifyou say that, really what you’re saying is we follow the rules unless we haveno choice.There are people inthis room who I have enormous amounts of respect for who have decided to breakrules.And we’ll talk about someof that later in the day.But onceyou decide to break rules, then you can make intelligent choices about whichrules to break.But if you’ve madethe decision that your job is to follow rules, you don’t get to have thechoice.And the only reason Iwrote the book is to get people to make that choice.I just want you to pick.Break rules or follow the rules.Fit in or stand out.Race to the top or race to the bottom.

And the problem with racing to the bottom is you mightwin.And if you win the race tothe bottom, that’s where you’re stuck.Whereas if you race to the top, you might now win but it’s okay becauseyou’re getting closer all the time.

We talked a little bit about this idea of emotionallabor.I’m not sure people reallyget the impact of both words, so let me start with the second one.Labor means hard.I never had a baby, but my guess isit’s called labor for a reason.And labor is worth paying for because very few people do it forfun.Emotional is even harder thanphysical.

There are people who voluntarily go for a long run to do thephysical labor on their muscles because they actually like the way itfeels.But emotional labor – laborthat makes you want to cry, labor that makes you feel tiny, labor that makesyou feel like a failure, labor that brings up all sorts of fear – reallyhorrible fear, that same feeling you have about things that you don’t even wantto talk about – it’s difficult to imagine doing that for fun.But what has happened to our economy isthat’s all we’re going to get paid for going forward.

All we’re going to get paid for at American standards.There are plenty of ways to get paid $2an hour, plenty of ways to get paid $4 an hour.Mechanical … will keep you busy all day long for $4 anhour for the rest of your life.But if you want to make $50 an hour, which is $100,000 a year, why wouldwe pay your for that?

We don’t need to pay you to type.We don’t need to pay you to move widget A to pile B.We don’t need to pay you to sit in ameeting and come up with objections.All we need to pay you for is doing this really difficult work.

I have a couple of the bonus items that I want to touchon.This idea of honest signals –Sandy Pentland wrote a book about it, he does research at MIT – is so importantand again, it’s not a theory, it’s real science, the people have tested and itworks.Human beings, like most wildanimals, are extraordinarily good at sensing tiny changes in theenvironment.And the changes thatwe’re the best at sensing are the way other people are feeling.That you can look somebody in the eyeand know if they’re afraid.Youcould look someone in the eye and have a sense as to whether they’relying.There are some people whocan trick you but generally they can’t.

And so when you meet someone who is truly generous, you canjust tell.When you meet someonewho is truly on the team and moving stuff forward, you can just tell.When you meet someone who is clearlytrying to slow things down, you can just tell.So you can’t fake the things that go into this emotionallabor thing.You have to havechosen before you got there.You’ve have to have committed before you got there because people aregoing to be able to smell it on you, literally.

That means that the more interactions we have, particularlynon-digital ones, the more likely it is that people will follow you when theysense that you’re on the path, that you’re actually making something happen.The path though, is the problem because you want a map.You want someone to say what do I donext?You want someone to say,“Now do this and now do this and then you win.”

If you go to a writer’s conference there’s all these peoplepaying money to be told step by step how to write a book that hasn’t beenwritten yet.If you go to artschool, there are all these days – days and days and days for money – step bystep on how to paint something that’s never been painted yet.

There’s no difference between that and coming up with a newstrategy for a textbook.There’sno difference between that and launching an iPad app that changeseverything.No one can tell youhow.

After Twitter hit the curve and became the fastest-growingcommunications medium in history, dozens of companies just like Twitter camealong.It only takes a week toprogram something like Twitter.You don’t win any prizes for having the seventh version of Twitter.We don’t need that.We needed you to do it before whenthere was no map.

Many management consultants know about the knowing-doinggap.This is a different kind ofknowing-doing gap.Theknowing-doing gap is that someone can read a book, it tells them what the mapis and then they don’t do anything.The knowing-doing gap is a manager can say to somebody “I need you to dothese things” and they shake their head and they know it, but they don’t dothem.We now have betterunderstanding about why that is.It’s not because the person’s stupid.It’s because the person has chosen notto do it.They have chosen not todo it for only one reason – they’re afraid.

We don’t like saying because we think fear is a differentsort of fear.It’s thenah-nah-nah-you’re-a-chicken fear. And that’s not the kind of fear I’m talkingabout.I’m talking about the feardeep down that the lizard brain has for survival.

I went to a business school that used to be called chaospilots in Amsterdam a couple weeks ago.They stand in a circle before every day and they do something called“check in.”And the way check-inworks is there are 12 people in a circle and it’s silent.

And when you feel like you have something to say about yourday today, your day yesterday, you say it.And when you’re done, you say “check out.”So you say “Check in.I’m really glad to be here today.Check out.”

And everyone goes around the circle not in order, just whenit occurs to you.And we wentthrough that and it was my turn and I was about ninth and I’m not shy, so Isaid, “You know?I don’t think youshould call this ‘Check in,’ I think you should call it ‘Chicken’ because whatyou’re doing is your’ giving everyone cover to say nothing, and what we reallyneed to say is ‘this is what I’m afraid of today, this is what I was afraid ofyesterday.’”

If we could honesty say out loud what we’re afraid of, itturns out that what we’re afraid of isn’t that scary.But because we pushed it over there into the closet, itseems really scary.But if we openthe door of the closet, look it in the eye, call it by name, what are we afraidof?

I’m giving a speech to 12 people.I’m petrified.Why are you petrified?Theymight not like it.Then what wouldhappen?I wouldn’t have to do itagain.Okay.So can we move on?Is it worth staying up all nightworrying about this?

You could be afraid of saber tooth tigers – that’s a goodthing to be afraid of.It’s evenokay to be afraid of pit bulls.Itis not okay to be afraid of giving a speech to 12 people.What’s going to happen?What’s the worse that couldhappen?And if you say it outloud, what you see is this: it’s very easy to describe what will happen if youstick with the status quo.If youdon’t give a speech, ever.If youdon’t have a blog, ever.If youdon’t put your ideas in front of people, ever.

If you don’t ship ever, then I guarantee what’s going tohappen – you’ll stay here until you get laid off and then you’re going to getold and then you’re going to die.

The other choice is to build an organization where you havea platform for people to do art.And the price of being in that organization is that youdemand change.And this is whereleadership comes in.

True story.Iused to have a company.It was 70people; we were in one big room.The New York office had 50 people in one giant room.And the rules were every 30 to 90 days;everyone had to move their desk to sit in a different place.And I told people the reason wasbecause no one should have to sit next to me for too long.

But the real reason is because if you can get over the fearof moving your desk, then it’s easy to get over the fear of a new businessmodel, the fear of a new role in the company because you have to go through allthat act of moving stuff.

About two years into it, I sat down with one of my threebest employees and I said to him, “Look, I’ve been going through what we’vebeen up to, and in the last nine months, you haven’t failed once.You haven’t done one thing that didn’twork.”And so I said, “If youdon’t fail soon, you’re fired.”And I meant it.

You can’t have it both ways.You can’t say this is an organization that embraceschange.This is an organizationthat embraces this kind of risk-taking and then rewards and embraces people whodon’t take risks.Youcan’t.You have to say the way youget fired at this company is by doing what you’re told.The way you lose your job – the thing Iwant you to be the most afraid of is being the least failing person in theorganization.

If we can shift the fear to the fear of not doing art, tothe fear of not standing up to the fear of not running to the top, then guesswhat – the lizard becomes your friend.It becomes your ally to help you ship.If you don’t ship you haven’t done a thing.

There’s no point in starting if you don’t finish.Finish can include quitting halfwaybecause you’ve done the right analysis.But there is no point in starting doing your best and then washing yourhands of it.That’s just wasting time.Which leads to this thought ofthrashing.And we’re going tospend a bit of time today talking about thrashing as a result as it relates toshipping.

Every project that ships late ships late for exactly thesame reason.So let me tell youthe story of the sequel to Duke Nukem, one of the most successful video gamesof all times.It made fifty,hundred, million dollars – something like that.

A tiny group of people owned all the rights.They said we’re going to make thesequel that’s going to be the best video game ever.Six months, ninth months, a year goes by, they’re 80% of theway there.

Now the team has 30 people on it and the meetings about whatcould be done in the last 20% get longer.The contributions of what needs to happen before it ships become morecommon.People say we’re reallyclose to shipping, so let’s add this feature because it would be a shame to nothave it.

We’re really close to shipping – wait a minute, there’s thisnew platform out, let’s make sure that we’ll be supporting that one.And it went on and it went on.And it was a perfect storm of an examplebecause they didn’t have a money shortage and there was no person yelling atthem from the other side because it was up to them.

Nine years later, they cancelled the project.It got to 80% three times and theycancelled the project.The reasonis simple:because ofthrashing.That the closer we getto shipping the louder the lizard brain gets.The more the reasons there are to worry. Think about howoften the CEO comes to the meeting.

Does the CEO – does she come at the beginning or she does comeat the end of the process?Shecomes at the end.Why botherwasting her time, right?Thinkabout when do the lawyers come?Dothe lawyers come at the beginning or do they come at the end?They come at the end and they say,“Wait, you can’t do ‘x’.Well,that was something we needed to know six months ago.”So the thrashing goes like this and then you don’t shipbecause there are too many people and too many connections and too manyobjections.

So how do you ship?Well, first you decide it’s important to ship.If you decide it’s important to ship, you do things in theright order, you do them with rigor.And what you say is the first week of this project is when we’re goingto thrash.

Lawyers, CEO come during the first week or don’t come atall.We can thrash all we want atthe beginning because we haven’t done, we haven’t laid the foundation, wehaven’t ordered the parts, we haven’t built everything.Come at the beginning and then you’re notallowed back in the room.You willnot see it again until it’s in the store. You will not see it again until it’sonline.You will not see it againuntil it’s shipped out the door, so you better come at the beginning and thrasha lot.

People say this is unrealistic.Well, shipping is unrealistic.It is unrealistic to imagine that three or five or fiftymotivated people can make a dent in the universe, but they can.And so the way they do it is by takingthe unrealistic act of thrashing at the beginning.Who runs your project?This is a critical semantic question.Are you going to have someone manage the project or run theproject?What’s the differencebetween managing it and running it?

Here’s my definition.Someone who manages a project is a reporter.The manager of the project reports to you how things aregoing. They report that this person was late.They report that that piece didn’t’ work.They report that certain environmentalsatiations made it so it wouldn’t happen.Someone running the project ships.

A lot of people in your organization don’t want to runanything because if you run something, you can fail.If you manage it, you just report – sorry, it’s out of mycontrol; I’ve reported everything as it’s happened, nothing I can do aboutit.But if you run it, then you’redoing the work because what you are doing is saying to people, “You cannot cometo this meeting because I’m responsible for shipping and if you come, we won’tship.”

And it’s much easier for the person running to say no toyou, don’t come, than it is to apologize three months later for beinglate.And that mindsetdistinguishes projects that ship from those that don’t.

Okay, so the last thing I want to do is read to you a note Igot.The punchline here isthis:everything I’ve talked toyou about for the last hour isn’t easy.In fact, it’s really hard.If you are a musician or a programmer or an accountant and you want todo art, and your heard everything I just said and you combine it with howdifficult it is to get people in the real world to hear your ideas, howdifficult it is to make a living doing this – it’s very easy to look – andeverything … that’s really hard.

And my answer is, “So? Why shouldn’t it be hard?”We’re talking about winning one of thebiggest games ever.We’re talkingabout having you impact on whatever universe you live in.We’re talking about turning pages thathave never been turned before.We’re talking about leaving a legacy behind that you can point to 10 or20 or 30 or 40 years later that your kids can point and say, “My mom shippedthat.”

Why shouldn’t that be hard?So here’s the note I got:It’s a pretty sobering picture for the future of art.Over the last couple of months, as I’veneared completion and have had to think more about where I’m going to take thismanuscript, and how I’m going to start establishing myself, the more and moreI’m realizing what a daunting, long-term proposition this is going to be.

If I want to be a person whose main thing is writing, thatis, the difficult part for me is that I’m not sure how to begin building a fanbase, begin cultivating that reputation and necessary connections with people,which makes me realize that if I personally don’t know where to begin orcontinue, I need to find people who can help me.But again, a difficult thing to begin.

We live in a strange world when the process of trying to getyour message or product to people is more time consuming and exhausting thanthe actual creation of art itself – the pouring your passion onto canvas orpage.I’m interested to know inwhat ways the model for the music industry is similar to that of publishingbooks.

Still, all this isn’t to turn me from going ahead.It’s just making it clear how much hardwork and creativity I’m going to have to put into finding out where my nextbuck is going to come from.ButI’m glad I’m realizing and beginning to work on this now since I think thatthis is the economic future for America – less security, money on the margins,needing a close network for support, having hands in many different schemes –that’s not just for artists, that’s the future as a whole.Not sure to what extent my generationunderstands that though.

So my mission going forward and the reason I said I have noplans to write another book is that this is the turning point of our time.That the hard work of building the FordMotor Company is really hard work.That the hard work of building Prudential Insurance is really hardwork.Those were important thingsthat our parents and our grandparents did.

The hard work that we have to do is to not use Twitter andFacebook to entertain ourselves and hide from the art.And the hard work that we have to do isnot go to yet another meeting with yet another boring boss who’s going to haveyet another boring project for us to do.

But the hard work – and we’re seeing it over and over againin every field I can imagine, not including bringing vaccines to the developingworld – the hard work is to look at the status quo and say, “Well, they builtall these tools for me.They builtall this leverage for me, and it’s not here to entertain me, it’s here topermit me to put myself at risk, to maybe have someone look me in the eye andsay, ‘You’re not good enough to do that.’”That’s really hard.

And then what we have to do as trainers or as managers or aspeople who can spread ideas is somehow put in front of people that what we needthem to do is to solve interesting problems.And what we need them to do is lead.And then if all they’reprepared to do is make widgets, we have a long slog ahead of us.But if we’re wiling to race to the topand do work that matters, my bet is that a few of us will do it often enough toactually make change.Thank youfor listening to that part, I appreciate it.Thank you.","April 27, 2010","Power dynamics, Emotional labor, Generosity"
“Powerpoint makes us stupid”–these bullets can kill,"The US Army reports thatmisuse of Powerpoint(in other words, using Powerpoint the way most people use it, the way it was designed to be used) is a huge issue.

Quid pro quo (santa math),"Walk up to the falafel stand and hand the guy $3. He hands you a falafel, no onions.
Thisforthat.
Something for something.
The time between surrendering the money and getting the sandwich is tiny. You gave him something, you got something. It's simple.
Now, stretch it out a bit. You order dinner in a restaurant. They treat you nicely, the room is beautiful, you enjoy the evening,thenyou pay the bill. This, pause, pause, pause, that.
Go to law school. Pay a lot of money. Spend a lot of time. Be taught a bunch of things you don't particularly want to know, things you probably don't need. Get a degree with a modicum of scarcity. Pay for a bar review course. Pass the bar. Then you get a job that pays a lot of money.
This, then a multi-year pause, then, in return,thatfor the next forty years. We call it return on investment.
Online, though, I'm not sure the math is so obvious. You don't write a blog to get gigs. You don't help people out in a forum to build a freelance business. Sure, that might happen, but that's not why you do it. If you are busy calculating quid pro quo, that means your heart isn't in it, and the math won't work out anyway.
Online, the something, the quid, thethis, doesn't cost cash. It takes heart and energy and caring, which are scarce but renewable resources. As a result, many people are able to spend them without seeking anything external in return. Even better, the act of generosity, of giving without expectation, makes it easier to do art, to create work that matters on its own.
I think it's more like Santa math. Santa flies around the world, giving stuff away, and for what? He earns gratitude, trust and friendship, that's what. Sure, one day he might decide to license his image or try to sell you something. But right here, right now, gratitude, trust and friendship are plenty. Especially if you enjoy doing what you're doing. Quid, no quo.","April 26, 2010","quid pro quo, generosity, online engagement"

Deniability,"How much of the time you invest in a project is spent preparing excuses, creating insurance, seeking deniability and covering your ass just in case things go poorly in the end?

Who judges your work?,"Here's the mistake we make in high school:
We let anyone, just anyone, judge our work (and by extension, judge us.)
Sue, the airheaded but long-legged girl in Spanish class gets the right to judge our appearance.
Bill, the bitter former-poet English teacher gets the power to tell us if we're good at writing.
And on and on.
The cheerleaders are deputized as the Supreme Court of social popularity, and the gym teacher forever has dibs on whether or not we're macho enough to make it in the world. These are patterns we sign up for, and they last forever (or until we tell them to go away).
In high school, some people learn to ship, they learn to do work that matters and most of all, they learn to ignore the critics they can never possibly please. The ability to choose who judges your work–the people who will make it better, use it and reward you–is the key building block in becoming an artist in whatever you do.","April 24, 2010","judgment, self-worth, artistic growth"

How to buy a house,"Actually, how tothinkabout buying a house.
You don't see a lot of ads trying to sell you on spending too much money on a house. It's more subtle than that. The marketing is all around us, and has been for years. The enormous social pressure and the expectations that come with it lead to misunderstandings and confusion. Here's my advice to someone in the market:
I'm optimistic about the power of a house to change your finances, to provide a foundation for a family and our communities.

Giving away a magician’s secrets,"Steve Cohen makes more than amillion dollarsa year doing magic tricks.
I will now tell you the secrets of this magic:
I guess it comes down to this: if you're having trouble persuading people to buy what you sell, perhaps you should sell something else. Failing that, perhaps you could talk about what you sell in a different way.
Important clarification: I'm not telling you to sell out or to pander or to dumb down your art. Great marketers lead people, stretching the boundaries and bringing new messages to people who want to hear them. The core of my argument is that someone's worldview, how they feel about risk or other factors, is beyond your ability to change in the short run. Sell people something they're interesting in buying. If you can't leverage the worldview they already have, you are essentially invisible. Which is a whole other sort of magic, one that's not so profitable.","April 19, 2010","magic, marketing, persuasion"
In search of a jealous chipmunk,"You won't find one, so don't waste your time.
Chipmunks, wolves and other wild animals rarely get jealous. The number one emotion among wild animals isn't vanity or happiness: it's fear.
Fear is everywhere in the animal kingdom, because fear is a great way to stay alive. Fear is hard-wired into successful species… it doesn't need to be taught.
You guessed it, we're wild animals too, a lot of the time. Marketing that preys on fear (buy duct tape!) has the shortest path to follow to success, because the public can't wait to get scared. An entire portion of our brain (the same brain the lizard has) is dedicated to fear. And it can't wait to spring into action.
If your fear keeps you alive, embrace it. The rest of the time, the best strategy for success is figuring out how to ignore it, befriend it or use it as a compass to find what matters.","April 18, 2010","chipmunks, fear, wild animals"
Incoming!,"Perhaps the biggest change in your worklife is one that snuck up on you.
Every morning, before you even take off your slippers, there's a pile of incoming work. You might not think of it as work, because it doesn't involve stuffing envelopes or making sales calls, but it's part of your career and your job.
That email, Facebook and message queue is a lot longer than it used to be. For some people, it's now a hundred or even a thousand distinct social electronic interactions a day. It's as if a genie is whispering in your ear, ""I have an envelope, and it might contain really good or really bad news. Want to open it?""
The relevant discussion here: are the incoming messages helping? After all, most of them aren't initiated by you, they have the power to change your mood or your energy or even how you spend your non-electronic time. And they're addictive. When, for some random reason, they ebb and you have a really light few hours–admit it, you check more often.
What's up? Is anyone out there?
It's like living near Niagara Falls and then one night it freezes. You miss the noise. Is it possible the noise is helping you hide from the stuff that scares you?
If you're actually going to do the work, the real work, the work of producing and shipping the things that matter, I'm afraid you're going to have to be brutally honest about whether this is merely a fun habit or actually a useful lever. Once the fun habit reaches a significant portion of your day (try tracking it today), it might be time to take charge instead of to be a willing victim.
Two years ago, I started taking a lot of flak for being choosy about which incoming media I was willing to embrace. What I've recently seen is that this is a choice that's gaining momentum.

The inefficiency of the all call,"Back when companies had offices, there was a button on the phone labeled ""all call"". It allowed you to page every speaker in the entire building at once.
""Tom P., you have a package at the front desk!""
It was a lot easier to hit all call than to just track down Tom. After a while, this group interruption gets tiresome because it's so wasteful. You interrupt 100 people to reach one, or you get ten offers of help (or someone to buy your hockey tickets) when one was all you needed.
Now, of course, the entire world hears your all call.
""I'm looking for this tool. Anyone know where to find it?"" 300,000 people see it, 230 tell you the answer, but of course 229 of those contributions are wasted.
Marketers love the all call, as long as it's cheap to interrupt everyone. And we waste all that attention, every single day. As long the game theory rewards the waster, the one who corrupts the system and hurts everyone else, it'll continue.

Cannibalism and spam,"So, these two cannibals are eating a clown, and one says to the other, ""does this taste funny to you?""
We don't often have conversations about cannibalism. We don't trade recipes or talk about health issues. That's because it's off the table, not permitted, inconceivable.
Marketers should feel the same way about spamming people. Spamming them by email, by text or yes, by calling their cell phones with a robot, repeatedly, just because it's cheap and because they can.


If anyone should know better, it's the Word of Mouth Marketing Association. And yet, not only did they spam thousands of people by phone, they want us to ""keep the convo rolling"". And when I spoke to their Executive Director, she had a hard time understanding that what they were doing was spam.
Spam is unanticipated, impersonal, irrelevant junk I don't want to get. Not only that, it costs them less to send it than it takes me to figure out what it is and deal with it. That doesn't scale. In fact, it destroys the medium.
Why would anyone join, pay their dues, go to their meetings or want to engage with an organization that's willing to cross a line like this? Even once? (and then brag about it!) Maybe I'm getting cranky, but the relentless march of marketers into our lives is really getting to me. [They've since apologized to those they spammed, which I appreciate.]
In case you missed the first part of our show, the future of marketing is based on permission. It's based on sending messages to people who want to get them, who choose to get them,who would miss you if you didn't send them.It's not easy and it's not cheap to earn permission, but so what? This is my attention, not yours, and if you want to use it for a while, please earn the privilege.
PS If I ran Twitter, I'd build my new ad service about a socially acceptable way for corporate users to build large lists of followers, people who would give permission to get news and discounts and insights from advertisers. Twitter knows who likes what and they have permission from users to be a bridge between the user and those that might want to talk to them. That's a powerful place to be.

Have you thought about your margin?,"Gross margin is an often confused concept but a powerful tool in figuring out how to market your business (and decide what to make, who to hire and how to fund it). Few people understand it, while others use a definition I don't find very useful.
I like to think of margin as the money left over after you've paid the direct costs for making an item, the last one of the day.
If you run a pizza place and a large pie costs $10, your gross margin is $10 minus the cost of flour, water, yeast, tomatoes and cheese. And maybe salt. That's it.
If you're not operating at capacity, the key word here is margin. The marginal profit of one more pizza is high. You've already paid for the rent, the oven, the sign, the ad in the Yellow Pages, the hourly wage, the uniforms, all of it. Whether you sell that last pizza of the day or not, all those costs are fixed. So, if your ingredients cost $2, your gross margin is $8.
This is vital to understand, because it tells you how flexible you can be with a promotional strategy. Some people (like me) prefer businesses with high gross margins, even if we're less busy. Others make billions on companies that run on the tiniest of margins.
If someone offers to run a coupon in the Welcome Wagon envelope that goes to new residents, and the rules are, ""one per customer, new customers only"", and the coupon offers a large pizza for $2, is it worth it for you to run it? That's 80% off! Surely, this is too expensive. You can't afford 80% off.
On the margin, of course you can. You got a new customer for free. Unless your store is at capacity, with people waiting in line, one more pizza sold at cost is a great way to build your business (unless there are too many coupons and unless it changes your positioning as a high-end place, but that's a story for a different day).
You probably already guessed this part: for digital goods, the gross margin is 100%. Cell phone calls? The same.
One more customer costs you nothing. That doesn't mean you should price accordingly, but it surely means you should understand how high your margins are.","April 13, 2010","Gross margin, profitability, promotional strategy"

When you can't figure out the best way to treat all your customers, the best way to price things, the best thing to offer, realize that the problem is almost always this: you're trying to treat everyone the same.

If breaking is stuff that interrupts a TV interview, flashes across a website, breaks into a radio show or just shows up on Twitter, then yep, there's a lot more breaking going on.

Rights and responsibilities,"Robert Bookman from the restaurant industry wasquotedas saying that it would violate the free speech rights of restaurant owners if they had to post a health department grade of their cleanliness in the window.
More and more, businesses and businesspeople talk about their rights.
It seems, though, that organizations and individuals that focus more on their responsibilities and less on their rights tend to outperform.
You're responsible to your community, to your customers, to your employees and to your art. Serve them and the rights thing tends to take care of itself.
Another thought: If I worked at Pepsi, I'd be actively lobbyingforthe obesitysweet soda tax(a penny an ounce) being proposed in New York. Instead, in a no-surprise knee jerk reaction, almost everyone in the industry is lobbying like crazy to stop it. This is dumb marketing.
The benefit of a tax is that it affects you and your competitors at the same time, so you all benefit from doing the right thing, as opposed to having to compete against someone who doesn't care as much as you do.
Once people realize that excessive use of your product makes them sick and then die a long and painful death, it's probably time to stop lobbying and time to start doing something about it. This industry should stop thinking it is in the corn syrup delivery business (which brings nasty side effects along with it) and start focusing on delivering joy in a bottle. Lots of interesting ways to do that without giving up profits.
If your success depends on sickening the poorest and least educated portion of your customer base (and the ones that buy the most from you), it's time to redefine success.","April 9, 2010","Rights, Responsibilities, Health Policy"
The Levy flight,"Clay Shirky taught me this very cool mathematical concept that shows up in nature, and now in marketing and social media.
An animal that forages will hang out in a small area, looking for nuts or berries, then will realize it has used up all the likely sources in this spot. It will then head off in a random direction, walk many paces, and start foraging again. When you plot theLevy flight, it looks like this:
Someone discovers your site. They poke and prod and join and return and return again. Then they feel as though there's no more benefit and they move on, surfing until they find another place to forage.
Someone finds your restaurant. They love it. They return with friends. They hang out and become regulars for a while. Then they get bored and start browsing again.
Adding the Levy flight to your understanding is a much more nuanced representation of consumer behavior than solely thinking about the ideas of brand loyalty or random web surfing.","April 8, 2010","Levy flight, consumer behavior, marketing"
Secrets of the biggest selling launch ever,"Apple reports that on the first day they sold more than $150,000,000 worth of iPads. I can't think of a product or movie or any other launch that has ever come close to generating that much direct revenue.
Are their tactics reserved for giant consumer fads? I don't think so. In fact, they work even better for smaller gigs and more focused markets.
And the one thing I'd caution you about:
A few things that will make it work even better going forward:
As promised, the folks atVookmade their deadline and were ready on launch day. It's early days, but it's pretty clear to me that the way authors with ideas will share them is going to change pretty radically, just as the iPad demonstrates that the way people interact with the web is going to keep changing as well.

You can find the bookhere.
Josh Bernoff is a generous guy with an unusual hobby… he likes to make book indices.
Safer than juggling knives, that’s for sure.
Josh just postedthe missing indexfor my bookLinchpin. Usually, the publisher does the index, and I’m embarrassed to admit I hadn’t realized it was missing. Now I’m glad it’s here.
Two asides about the book:The full-length audio (itunes,audible) is probably the best reading of one of my books. Audio books work (for me) when you can listen to them more than once. I listened to my Zig Ziglar tapes more than a hundred times each–and I’m glad I did. And thehardcover, (bn) I’m told, is selling twice as fast as any book I’ve ever published. Thanks for that.

Revisiting conspicuous consumption,"The reason you have a front lawn? It's a tradition. Lawns were invented as a way for the landed gentry to demonstrate that they could afford to waste land. By taking the land away from the grazing sheep, they were sending a message to their neighbors. We're rich, we can happily waste the opportunity to make a few bucks from our front lawn.
Conspicuous consumption has a long history. Wasting millions of dollars on a shark in a tank, or on $50,000 platinum stereo cables that sound an awful lot like $2000 stereo cables (which sound a lot like $200 stereo cables). And on and on.
In fact, the origins of the luxury goods industry lie in this desire to waste, in public. 350 years ago in France, Jean-Baptiste Colbert dreamed up the idea of bespoke, rare goods as a way of improving France's balance of trade.  LVMH and other huge corporations collect brands that telegraph scarcity above all else.Not that they're better at performing the task at hand, merely that they are expensive and rare.
(Interesting note: it's estimated that20%of all the women in Japan in their 20s own a Louis Vuitton bag… scarce?)
In every city there are expensive hotels that are noisy, with $56 breakfasts, no parking, blinds that don't make the room dark and rooms that don't have enough closets. But the very waste of paying extra to stay there ensures that you'll be surrounded by others just as wealthy and just as interested in proving it.
Rich people will always indulge the desire to stand out, but I wonder if there's a new version:
Spending on and investing intime, not stuff.
And it's not so wasteful, this focus on craftsmen.
The new trend in spending money is to buythingsthatarepainstakinglyhandbuiltinstead of efficiently mass produced. It might not be a better price than what you could buy at Target, but the very fact that you can pay for an artisan to create it, an artist to design it, a talented worker to bring it to life–that act makes a powerful statement about what you can afford and what's important to you. Instead of a bigger house, it's a house that's built from scratch by craftsmen. Instead of a bigger steak, it's a handmade dish of local poached vegetables…
All marketers tell a story. The ""this is the best price and value"" story is just one of those available, and in fact, it's rarely the most effective for the audience you may be trying to reach.","April 6, 2010","Conspicuous consumption, luxury goods, artisan craftsmanship"
Accepting limits,"It's absurd to look at a three year old toddler and say, ""this kid can't read or do math or even string together a coherent paragraph. He's a dolt and he's never going to amount to anything."" No, we don't say that because we know we can teach and motivate and cajole the typical kid to be able to do all of these things.
Why is it okay, then, to look at a teenager and say, ""this kid will never be a leader, never run a significant organization, never save a life, never inspire or create…""
Just because it's difficult to grade doesn't mean it shouldn't be taught.
Never mind a teenager. I think it's wrong to say that about someone who's fifty.
Isn't it absurd to focus so much energy on 'practical' skills that prep someone for a life of following instructions but relentlessly avoid the difficult work necessary to push someone to reinvent themselves into becoming someone who makes a difference?

One in a million,"The chances of a high school student eventually becoming first violin for the Boston Philharmonic: one in a million.
The chances of a high school student eventually playing basketball in the NBA? About the same.
In fact, the chances of someone growing up and getting a job precisely like yours, whatever it is, are similarly slim. (Head of development at an ad agency, director of admissions for a great college… you get the idea). Every good gig is a long shot, but in the end, a lot of talented people get good gigs. The odds of being happy and productive and well compensated aren't one in a million at all, because there are many good gigs down the road. The odds are only slim if you pick precisely one job.
Here's the lesson: the ardent or insane pursuit of a particular goal is a good idea if the steps you take along the way also prep you for other outcomes, each almost as good (or better). If pushing through the Dip and bending the market to your will and shipping on time and doing important and scary work are all things you need to develop along the way, then it doesn't really matter so much if you don't make the goal you set out to reach.
On the other hand, if you live a life of privation and spend serious time and money on a dead end path with only one outcome, you've described a path likely to leave you broken and bitter. Does spending your teenage years (and your twenties) in a roompracticing the violin teach you anything about being a violin teacheror a concert promoter or some other job associated with music?

"Failure, success and neither","The math is magical: you can pile up lots of failures and still keep rolling, but you only need one juicy success to build a career.
The killer is the category called 'neither'. If you spend your days avoiding failure by doing not much worth criticizing, you'll never have a shot at success. Avoiding the thing that's easy to survive keeps you from encountering the very thing you're after.

Are you rational?,"Before you make any more decisions you need to answer that question.
A rational decision is based on testing and data and an understanding of the mechanics underneath the system you're working on. The more you know, the better you decide.
An irrational decision is based on gut instincts, conviction and faith.
No one is rational all the time. In fact, somewhere along the way we made 'irrational' into a bad word, but it shouldn't be.
There are card counters in Las Vegas who are rational about blackjack. And they make a decent living. The more they play, the better they will do. In the same casino, there are craps players who blow on the dice, wiggle their hips and wear lucky shoes. Inevitably, if they play long enough, they will be broke.
If you're running Adwords on Google, I hope you're making rational decisions based on clickthrough and conversion.
On the other hand, were you rational when you fell in love? Did you do the math? Medical analysis?
What about the last time you fell for an April Fools joke?
The very nature of faith is that you don't (and shouldn't be) rational about it. In fact, you're entitled to be aghast when anyone confronts you with proof. Proof and rationality aren't the point.
Same with fine art. If your taste in paintings or music or wine is based on some sort of rational analysis or Zagats-type survey, I feel quite badly for you. Deeper and more detailed information is not better information when you're making irrational decisions. If you need to hate on Copernicus in order to have more faith, something is seriously wrong.
When Chris Blackwell introduced reggae to the rest of the world (Bob Marley!), it was irrational. That moment in time was the best time to be working with Bonnie Raitt or Jackson Browne, not some unknown spleef-smoking guys from a tiny island in the Caribbean. No amount of rational analysis would have led an investor to back Chris.
Irrational passion is the key change agent of our economy. Faith and beauty and a desire to change things can't be easily quantified, and we can't live without them.
Steve Jobs is irrational about product design. As a result, focus groups make no sense. Who cares what other people think? He has faith in his gut. Your website: is it rationally designed? Should it be? What about the process you use to create new products or ads? Or the way you pick the focus of your startup? There's room for both rational and irrational decision making, and I think we do best when we choose our path in advance instead of pretending to do one when we're actually doing the other. The worst thing we can do is force one when we actually need the other.","April 1, 2010","Rationality, Decision Making, Irrationality"

"The distraction, the tail and the dog","Your business has a core, a goal, a challenge and a deliverable. There is probably one thing that would transform your project, onesuccess that changes things, one hurdle that's tougher than the others. What's difficult, what would respond tooverwhelming attention? That's the core.
Getting from here to there involves making sales, delivering on promises, overcoming the Dip and shipping.
Along the way, there are supporting tasks you can engage in, things you can do to make the goal easier to achieve.
A popular blog might gain attention and then trust and ultimately help you sell more widgets.
A lot of followers online might give you permission to tell a story that gets you better employees.
A vibrant party at SXSW can create buzz that gives your salespeople entree to important meetings.
These aren't trivial activities. In fact, they're part of what marketing means today. But…
But if they give you and your team an outlet to avoid the difficult work of achieving your goal (""I can't go to that sales call, I'm busy uploading pictures of last night's party to the blog and then tweeting out the url"") then you're not building, you're hiding. Rich calls this playing withturtles. The thing is, the turtles are alive, and they're going to demand a lot from you.
There's a huge downside here: once your side activity gets going, it will lead to crises (we have an urgent email we have to answer), to feelings of abandonment (hey, you haven't been on the forum lately!), to irresistible offers to have the CEO speak or get people involved. There will always be a feeling of sunk cost, of opportunities missed and of things on the verge because these are human movements, not paid ads.
Two choices: 1. find a way to make your goal completely aligned with the tactics you use to achieve it. What's good for your blog is good for your business. or 2.

Here's what the app does (I hope someone will build it): (I know some of these features require a lot of work, and some might require preparation before the meeting. Great! Perhaps then the only meetings we have will be meetings worth having, meetings with an intent to produce an outcome). I can dream…
1. There's an agenda, distributed by the host, visible to everyone, with time of start and stop, and it updates as the meeting progresses.
2. There's a timer, keeping things moving because it sits next to the agenda.
3. The host or presenter can push an image or spreadsheet to each device whenever she chooses.
4. There's an internal back channel that the host can turn on, permitting people in the room to chat privately with each other. (And the whole thing works on internal wifi, so no internet surfing to distract!)
5. There's a big red 'bored' button that each attendee can push anonymously. The presenter can see how many red lights are lighting up at any give time.
6. There's a bigger green 'GO!' button that each attendee can push anonymously. It lets the host or presenter see areas where more depth is wanted.
7. There's a queue for asking questions, so they just don't go to the loudest, bravest or most powerful.
8. There's a voting mechanism.
9. There's a whiteboard so anyone can draw an idea and push it to the group.
10. There's a written record of all activity created, so at the end, everyone who attended can get an email digest of what just occurred. Hey, it could even include who participated the most, who asked questions that others thought were useful, who got the most 'boring' button presses while speaking…
11. There's even a way the host can see whoisn't using it actively.
Can you imagine how an hour flies by when everyone has one of these in a meeting? How focused and exhausting it would all be?

"Pfffft, the danger of premature shipment","The old economy demanded a flurry of hard work, obsessive focus, and a charrette before launch. Launches were expensive and rare, and managers and co-workers would push to get everythingjust rightbefore hitting the big red button to announce, ship and launch. The attention demanded by this scarcity raised the game, overcame fear and pushed things from one level to another.
A big reason for the push is to ameliorate risk. Launching is risky business, and one way to diminish that risk in a world of scarcity and market noise is to go big. And then big becomes a habit.
In the new economy, in the economy of launch and learn and revise, some of thePOP! is replaced byPfffft. Because there's no big launch, we get more easily distracted, we don't push ourselves as hard, we don't treat that first day as as big a deal. There's less risk because you're going straight to your tribe, not hoping for a cultural mass-market sensation every time.
The thing is, if I had a book launch party every time I posted on this blog, the cheese and crackers would kill me. And the idea of a gold master in software development is now an antique. There's a paradox here:
The good news is that fewer good ideas get killed for feeling too risky.
The bad news is that sometimes we trade in the important for the trivial.
The punchline is that some artificial pop might be required. Just because it's easy to ship doesn't mean you shouldn't push yourself. The art is in ignoring the fear that pushes you to polish too much…","May 26, 2010","premature shipment, launch culture, risk management"

The modern business plan,"It’s not clear to me why business plans are the way they are, but they’re often misused to obfuscate, bore and show an ability to comply with expectations. If I want the real truth about a business and where it’s going, I’d rather see something else. I’d divide the modern business plan into five sections:
Thetruthsection describes the world as it is. Footnote if you want to, but tell me about the market you are entering, the needs that already exist, the competitors in your space, technology standards, the way others have succeeded and failed in the past. The more specific the better. The more ground knowledge the better. The more visceral the stories, the better. The point of this section is to be sure that you’re clear about the way you see the world, and that you and I agree on your assumptions. This section isn’t partisan, it takes no positions, it just states how things are.
Truth can take as long as you need to tell it. It can include spreadsheets, market share analysis and anything I need to know about how the world works.
Theassertionssection is your chance to describe how you’re going to change things. We will do X, and then Y will happen. We will build Z with this much money in this much time. We will present Q to the market and the market will respond by taking this action.
This is the heart of the modern business plan. The only reason to launch a project is to change something, and I want to know what you’re going to do and what impact it’s going to have.
Of course, this section will be incorrect. You will make assertions that won’t pan out. You’ll miss budgets and deadlines and sales. So thealternativessection tells me what you’ll do if that happens. How much flexibility does your product or team have? If your assertions don’t pan out, is it over?
The people section rightly highlights the key element… who is on your team, who is going to join your team. ‘Who’ doesn’t mean their resume, who means their attitudes and abilities and track record in shipping.
And the last section is all about money. How much do you need, how will you spend it, what does cash flow look like, P&Ls, balance sheets, margins and exit strategies.
Your local VC might not like this format, but I’m betting it will help your team think through the hard issues more clearly.","May 24, 2010","business plan, strategy, finance"

I'm delighted (and a little surprised) that so many people are realizing how easy and powerful it is to surround oneself with people who will egg you on. Projects large and small are being spawned (including a slick magazine) but far more powerful, I think, is the psychic energy and encouragement you find when you discover that others are doing what you're doing, that they're walking the same road.
The real impact ofLinchpin, then, is the ability of a book to help individuals verbalize what they already knew, and to connect us to one another. With a little effort, this can scale, the connections can become more vibrant and we can all ship some work worth doing.

On finding referrals,"The people who work the hardest to get referrals, it seems to me, are the people who least deserve them.
If you make average stuff for average people, why exactly will someone refer you? If you are busy selling standard insurance policies to standard insurance clients, why will someone refer you? Because you're good at golf?
In fact, the best way to get referrals is to change what you do, what you sell, how you act when times are difficult, how generous you are when you don't need to be.
Yes, you should make it easy for people to refer you. Yes you should be aware that asking for referrals can help. (John has a newbookabout this).

Multiple dumbnesses,"About twenty five years ago, Howard Gardner taught us his theory of multiple intelligences.

This makes perfect sense—people are good at different things.
The flip side of this occurred to me the other day, as I was busy judging someone for being really dumb. Of course, no one is really dumb. And certainly no one deserves to be judged as such. If we're good at different things, we're alsobadat different things, right?
The story people tell about you (and the one you tell about yourself in the way you act) may be broadcasting one of your weaknesses louder than you deserve.

The hard part is the last ten percent, sure, or even the last one percent, but it's the hard part because everyone is busy doing the easy part already.

Who is easily manipulated?,"Sometimes (and too often) marketers work to manipulate people. I define manipulation as working to spread an idea or generate an action that is not in a person's long-term best interest.
The easiest people to manipulate are those that don't demand a lot of information, are open to messages from authority figures and are willing to make decisions on a hunch, particularly if there's a promise of short-term gains.
If you want to focus on the short run and sell something, get a vote or gather a mob, the easiest place to start is with populations that leave themselves open to manipulation.
There are habits and activities that leave people open to manipulation. I'm not saying they are wrong or right, just pointing out that these behaviors make you open to being manipulated… Here are a few general categories of behaviors that manipulators seek out:
Interesting to note that AM radio used to be filled with ads for second mortgages. And now? Gold.
Manipulating people using modern techniques is astonishingly easy (if the marketer has few morals). You only make it easier when you permit people and organizations that want to take advantage of you to do so by allowing them to use your good nature and your natural instincts against you. It happens every day in Washington DC, online, on TV and in your local community institutions.","May 18, 2010","manipulation, marketing, susceptibility"
The circles (no more strangers),"It's so tempting to seek out more strangers.
More strangers to pitch your business, your candidate, your non-profit, your blog… More strangers means more upside and not so much downside. It means growth.
The problem is that strangers are difficult to convert. And the other problem is that they're expensive to reach. And the hardest problem is that we're running out of strangers.
Consider this hierarchy: Strangers, Friends, Listeners, Customers, Sneezers, Fans and True Fans. One true fan is worth perhaps 10,000 times as much as a stranger. And yet if you're in search of strangers, odds are you're going to mistreat a true fan in order to seduce yet another stranger who probably won't reward you much.
Let's say a marketer has $10,000 to spend. Is it better to acquire new customers at $2,000 each (advertising is expensive) or spend $10 a customer to absolutely delight and overwhelm 1,000 true fans?
Or consider a non-profit looking to generate more donations. Is it better to embrace the core donor base and work with them to host small parties with their friends to spread the word, or would hiring a PR firm to get a bunch of articles placed pay off more efficiently?","May 17, 2010","Strangers, True Fans, Marketing"
Arrogant,"This is a fear and a paradox of doing work that's important.
A fear because so many of us are raised to avoid appearing arrogant. Being called arrogant is a terrible slur, it means that you're not only a failure, but a poser as well.
It's a paradox, though, because the confidence and attitude that goes with bringing a new idea into the world (""hey, listen to this,"") is a hair's breadth away, or at least sometimes it feels that way, from being arrogant.
And so we keep our head down. Better, they say, to be invisible and non-contributing than risk being arrogant.
That feels like a selfish, cowardly cop out to me. Better, I think, to make a difference and run the risk of failing sometimes, of being made fun of, and yes, appearing arrogant. It's far better than the alternative.","May 16, 2010","Arrogance, Confidence, Paradox"
Who do you work for? (And who works for you?),"I always took the position that my boss (when I had a job) worked for me. My job was to do the thing I was hired to do, and my boss had assets that could help me do the job better. His job, then, was to figure out how best give me access to the people, systems and resources that would allow me to do my job the best possible way.
Of course, that also means that the people I hire are in charge as well. My job isn't to tell them what to do, my job is for them to tell me what to do to allow them to keep their promise of delivering great work.
If you go into work on Monday with a list of things for your boss to do for you (she works for you, remember?) what would it say?

Don Quijote didn’t ship,"Society makes heroes out of entrepreneurs and adventurers that tilt at windmills and succeed. Napster slays the music industry! Twitter comes out of nowhere!
The thing about taking on the biggest giants is that most of the time (so often as to be all of the time if you're willing to do some rounding) you fail. You don't just fail at the end, you often fail long before the end.
Yet the dreamers persist. These are usually the garage entrepreneurs, people with little market success behind them, those working without a track record or significant resources. People forget that Google was backed with millions of dollars from the biggest VCs in the world when they took on Yahoo.
I know, I know, I'm supposed to be the guy who says, ""go for it!"" but the fact is, most of the time the choice to take on impossible odds, to challenge the entrenched monopolist is the work of the lizard brain. After all, if you dream theimpossibledream and go after the thing thatcan't possiblywork, you don't have to worry about being criticized, you don't have to worry about the responsibility of shipping or serving your customers. After all, it was impossible.
Tangling with the largest possible opponent, when you are severely overmatched is a way of giving in to the resistance, of not actually shipping.
My best advice: win little battles. Get in the habit of winning, of shipping, of having customers that can't live without you. Once you've demonstrated you know how to do the art,thengo after the windmills.","May 14, 2010","entrepreneurship, failure, resilience"
All you need to know…,"is that it's possible.
Mike sent me a greatstoryabout an ultra-lightweight backpacker:
""Wolf was carrying a super-small pack which weighed 14 pounds including food and water. When asked how he got his pack weight so low, Wolf would reply, 'All you need to know is that it’s possible.'""
One of the under-reported stories of the internet is this: it constantly reports on what'spossible. Somewhere in the world, someone is doing something that you decided couldn't be done. By calling your bluff and by pointing out the possibilities, this reporting of possibility changes everything.
You can view this as a horrible burden, one that raises the bar and eliminates any sinecure of comfort and hiding you can find, or you can embrace it as a chance to stretch.

Will you miss them if they leave? (Call for linchpins),"If you know someone who does great work, who brings passion and humanity with them instead of leaving it at the door of the factory, I’d like to help you celebrate them. Read on for three ways you can do that–fast and free.
Here are the three options, from most involved to least.
1. If you live in New York City or can get here easilyThe folks at Vook want to talk to you. Vook creates augmented ebooks with video on the iPad, iPhone and other platforms. They had terrific success translatingUnleashing the Ideavirus, and now they want to do it with my latest book,Linchpinas well.
It will contain video of people like you talking about Linchpins who matter to them, who have overcome the resistance and shipped their art to the world. If you know someone like that and are able to appear on camera at their New York studios, drop a line to rachel@vook.com and tell her who and what you'd like to celebrate.
2. If you’d like to submit a video but don’t live in New York
If you visit theFacebookpage they’ve built, you can easily upload a video you shoot yourself. The best videos are simple, short and shot on a neutral background. Don’t merely tell them who the linchpin is, but tell everyone why–what's their art, what fear do they overcome, how do they contribute. Talk about what do they do, or why do they do it or when did they realize that they could make this dent in the universe.
[To upload videos to the Vook Facebook page, you must ""Like"" the page and then you will have the option to upload videos directly to the page wall.]
3. If you have a photo of your Linchpin
I’m going to be updating the inside of the cover of my book. I’m looking for pictures to include, and all you need to do isemail it to this address according to these instructions. (Please read carefully before hitting send!) The new cover will be out before the end of the year.

How to submit a picture for the inside of the new Linchpin jacket,"Short version: snap a photo and email it toworking90words@photos.flickr.com.
Complete no-hassle version: Five steps to uploading a photo to be included on the inside cover ofLinchpin:
1. Decide who you’d like to feature (you can submit more than one person, but only one at a time).
2.Acquire a headshot of that person, one that you own the rights to. Best plan is to take it yourself.
3.No logos, ape costumes or group photos please.
4. Email it (byattaching it to a standard email) toworking90words@photos.flickr.com. If you have trouble attaching a jpg photo to an email, here's atutorial. Only one photo per email, only jpg photos, please!
5.Don’t put a note to me in the email, since I won’t be able to read it. And I'm afraid there's no way for me to send a confirmation, since I'm routing the emails through a complicated, handbuilt mosaic system I've cobbled together… it's already a huge undertaking.
By sending the photo, you agree that you own the rights to do so and give me permission to include it. It's the only place I'll be using it, no ads, no billboards, etc.
Ican’t guarantee that all photos will be included. Please don’t sendduplicates or photos of famous people. Deadline is June 1, 2010 atmidnight.I'm giving priority to early submissions.

"Sentences, paragraphs and chapters","It's laughably easy to find someone to critique a sentence, to find a missing apostrophe or worry about your noun-verb agreement.
Sometimes, you're lucky enough to find someone who can tell you that a paragraph is dull, or out of place.
But finding people to rearrange the chapters, to criticize the very arc of what you're building, to give you substantive feedback on your strategy–that's insanely valuable and rare.
Perhaps one criticism in a hundred is actually a useful and generous contribution in your quest to reorganize things for the better.
[And for those in need of subtitles, this isn't a post about your next novel. It's about your business, your career and your life.]
Four people tell you that there was a typo on the third slide in your presentation.

Are you an elite?,"In the developing world, there's often a sharp dividing line between the elites and everyone else. The elites have money and/or an advanced education. It's not unusual to go to the poorest places on earth and find a smallcadre of people who aren't poor at all. Sometimes, this is an unearned position, one that's inherited or acquired in ways that take advantage of others. Regardless, you can't just announce you're an elite and become one.
In more and more societies, though (including my country and probably yours [and I'm including virtually the entire planet here, except perhaps North Korea] ), I'd argue that there's a different dividing line. This is the line between people who are actively engaged in new ideas, actively seeking out change, actively engaging–and people who accept what's given and slog along. It starts in school, of course, and then the difference accelerates as we get older. Some people make the effort to encounter new challenges or to grapple with things they disagree with. They seek out new people and new opportunities and relish the discomfort that comes from being challenged to grow (and challenging others to do the same).
Perhaps I'm flattering myself (and you) but I think almost everyone who reads blogs like this one is part of the elites. It's not because of birth or financial standing, it's because of a choice, the decision to be aware and engaged, to challenge a status quo of your choice.
The number of self-selected elites is skyrocketing. Part of this is a function of our ability to make a living without working 14 hours a day in a sweatshop, but part of it is the ease with which it's possible to find and connect with other elites.
The challenge of our time may be tobuild organizations and platforms that  engage and coordinate the elites, wherever they are. After all, this is where change and productivity come from.
Once you identify this as your mission, you save a lot of time and frustration in your outreach. If someone doesn't choose to be part of the elites, it's unclear to me that you can persuade them to change their mind. On the other hand, the cycle of discovery and engagement and shipping the elites have started is going to accelerate over time, and you have all the tools necessary to be part of it–to lead it, in fact.","May 11, 2010","Elites, Engagement, Change"
Surfing is the new career,"Three months ago I wrote aboutfarming and hunting. It seems, though, that the growth industry of our generation is surfing.
Talk to surfers and they'll explain that the entire sport comes down to the hunt for that blissful moment that combines three unstable elements in combination: the wave is just a little too big to handle, the board is going just a little too fast, and the ride could end at any moment.
This makes for a great sport (for some people, anyway) but until recently, it wasn't much of a career path. (aside: Aimless web surfing is a waste of time, and that's not the sort of surfing I'm referring to). That feeling of freedom and risk in equal measure was difficult to find at work, so we sought it out on the slopes or the ocean.
Once we figured out how to get thrills from waves, we could switch to snow, or to stand up paddling, or kiteboarding. Different terrain, same cycle.
More people, though, are finding a way to surf and get paid for it. Freelance projects, joint ventures, entrepreneurial startups are all paying off for people who are hooked on this feeling ofplan, launch, cowabunga, repeat. Each time you do it, you get to take on a bigger project, a bigger wave. The cost of wiping out is low (if you plan for it) and so you can do it again and again. You don't even have to be solo… now there are teams and corporations that seek out people who want to surf their way through fundraising or product development or customer delight.
We see successful musicians and writers do this all the time. Now, though, it's not unusual to watch someone surf in their development of shareware, or in the videos they post online or risks they take in their personal blog.
So many of the conversations I have every day could easily be replaced with, ""so, where's the next wave? Tell me about your last one…""","May 10, 2010","Surfing, Career, Entrepreneurship"
Where do you find good ideas?,"Do you often find ideas that change everything in a windowless conference room, with bottled water on the side table and a circle of critics and skeptics wearing suits looking at you as the clock ticks down to the 60 minutes allocated for this meeting?
If not, then why do you keep looking for them there?
The best ideas come out of the corner of our eye, the edge of our consciousness, in a flash. They are the result of misdirection and random collisions, not a grinding corporate onslaught. And yet we waste billions of dollars in time looking for them where they're not.
A practical tip: buy a big box of real woodenblocks. Write a key factor/asset/strategy on each block in big letters. Play with the blocks. Build concrete things out of non-concrete concepts. Uninvite the devil's advocate, since the devil doesn't need one, he's doing fine.

Becoming a bus company,"We all have a vision of the typical bus company, slowly moving people from place to place, going through the motions and showing a lot of fatigue.
Some of the elements that make an organization feel like a bus company:
American Airlines has officially become a bus company, without a doubt. On a recent non-flight (it got canceled) all of these elements occurred. Only one (1) act of human initiative would have made a huge difference.
More and more, I'm seeing bus company behavior from previously great organizations. It's a symptom of companies (and cultures) under long-term stress. These are all traits that occur when you allow standards to erode, when you embrace the status quo and when management gives up. You don't need lots of money or squadrons of people to change this, you just need to care.
Ironically, there are newbuscompanies that are proving that there's always a way to avoid this fate.","May 8, 2010","bus company, organizational behavior, company culture"
"Mentoring, platforms and taking a leap","How much support does someone need (or get, or deserve, you pick) before they ship their art?
The fearfullizard braindemands reassurance and coaching and even a push before it is quiet enough to permit us to do the difficult work our economy demands, before it will allow us to create art that changes others.
So it's logical to wonder how to build systems that encourage legions of people to find that reassurance, and it's encouraging to imagine that we could build a school or a coaching program or other external forces that would create more artists.
And yet most mentors and coaches and teachers will tell you that few of their students ever do, not in comparison with their potential. A few break through and change everything, and we celebrate them, but what about everyone else?

Micro magazines and a future of media,"Does anyone read Time orNewsweek(being sold to anyone who will take them) any more? And when they disappear, who will really miss them?
The problem is that they are both slow and general. The world, on the other hand, is fast and specific.
Is there a business here?
While there are still people hoping to make a living writing a blog (not as a tool for something else, but as an end into itself), that's awfully difficult to do. Micro-magazines, on the other hand, feel very different to me. They have elements that make them very attractive to advertisers and readers.
I'll define one as:
There's room in the market for 100,000 profitable micro-magazines. Why not have one about Aruba, for example? If all the people who vacation in Aruba could read about the island in detail every month, read about restaurants, resorts and politics, for free, in an easy to share format… Multiply this by every destination, every interest group, every type of profession (how about a micro-magazine for ethnobiologists?)
Surely you can think of a group of people that share a demo- or psychographic, that are appealing to an advertiser base and want to learn and share what they learn… for free.
Take a look at Clay and Ishita's new magazine,Fearless.  It's jammed with good stuff, it's engaging and it begs to be shared. While the audience for Fearless isn't as vertical as some, it clearly should resonate with some advertisers, the sort that might pay for an ad in the soon to be irrelevant newsweeklies. And the big difference is that instead of paying for an office building and paper and overhead, the money for an ad in a micro-magazine can go directly to the people who write and promote it and the ad itself will be seen by exactly the right audience… (Aside:Newsweekhas 427 employees and a guaranteed circulation of 1.5million.Fearlesswill probably end up reaching 100,000 people with 2 employees.)
Don't expect overnight successes in this form of media, but certainly expect that once someone figures out how to be the voice of a tribe, the revenue will take care of itself.","May 6, 2010","micro-magazines, media future, advertising"
Consumer debt is not your friend,"Here's a simple MBA lesson:borrow money to buy things that go up in value.Borrow money if it improves your productivity and makes you more money. Leverage multiplies the power of your business because with leverage, every dollar you make in profit is multiplied.
That's very different from the consumer version of this lesson: borrow money to buy things that go down in value. This is wrongheaded, short-term and irrational.
A few decades ago, mass marketers had a problem: American consumers had bought all they could buy. It was hard to grow because dispensable income was spoken for. The only way to grow was to steal market share, and that's difficult. Enter consumer debt.
Why fight for a bigger piece of pie when you can make the whole pie bigger, the marketers think. Charge it, they say. Put it on your card. Pay now, why not, it's like it's free, because you don't have to repay it until later. Why buy a Honda for cash when you can buy a Lexus with credit?
One argument is income shifting: you're going to make a lot of money later, so borrow now so you can have a nicer car, etc. Then, when money is worth less to you, you can pay it back. This idea is actually reasonably new–fifty years or so–and it's not borne out by what actually happens. Debt creates stress, stress creates behaviors that don't lead to happiness…
The other argument is that it's been around so long, it's like a trusted friend. Debt seems like fun for a long time, until it's not. And everyone does it. We've been sold very hard on acquisition = happiness, and consumer debt is the engine that permits this. Until it doesn't.
The thing is, debt has become a marketed product in and of itself. It's not a free service or a convenience, it's a massive industry. And that industry works with all the other players in the system to grow, because (at least for now) when they grow, other marketers benefit as well. As soon as you get into serious consumer debt, you work for them, not for you.
It's simple: when the utility of what you want (however you measure it)is less than the cost of the debt, don't buy it.
Go read Dave Ramsey's post:The truth about debt.
Dave has spent his career teaching people a lesson that many marketers are afraid of: debt is expensive, it compounds, it punishes you. Stuff now is rarely better than stuff later, because stuff now costs you forever if you go into debt to purchase it. He's persistent and persuasive.
It takes discipline to forego pleasure now to avoid a lifetime of pain and fees. Many people, especially when confronted with a blizzard of debt marketing, can't resist.
Resist. Smart people work at keeping their monthly consumer debt burden to zero. Borrow only for things that go up in value. Easy to say, hard to do. Worth it.","May 5, 2010","Consumer debt, financial discipline, leveraging assets"
All the news that fits,"After years of reading newspapers, I've never seen a paper that said, ""sorry, not much happened yesterday, so today's paper is shorter than usual."" In fact, the length of the paper is virtually always driven by the number of ads, not by the amount of news (wars, elections and disasters are the exception). Editors are told how many pages of stories they can run by the publisher, who bases it on ads sold.
The web, of course, doesn't have the problem of paying for paper, so the length of a website isn't driven by ads, it's driven by reader attention and writer fatigue. If you run less material, then readers with attention to spare will just go read more on someone else's site. Hence the temptation to write more and more and more and try to milk pageviews.
The same math works for direct marketers and brochures. Since it's free to keep writing or to make that video ever longer, it's tempting to do so. Might as well keep talking until the reader surrenders and buys something.
Here's the problem with that math:people like to be done.
Sure, there will always be a few who want more, but you're often better off giving the majority a sense of mastery and a platform to take action.

I've found that people can really benefit from direct and personal interactions, and so I'm bringing the seminar to a select group of cities over the next year (more if people show up).

So that's the way I'm approaching this tour. No slides, not so many carefully rehearsed bits, just me and a focused audience, talking through issues that matter. The goal isn't to deliver twitter-sized sound bites, but instead to immerse participants in a different way of thinking about the work we do and how we spread our ideas. I want to urgently and persistently change the way you do your work.
This is the one and only public seminar I'm going to be offering in any of these cities, so I hope you'll let people who might be interested know.
Today, we're announcing events for the next four months, one a month beginning in June.I built a page with all the details: Boston, Washington DC, Minnesota and Chicago. The one after that is Atlanta (details to follow).
If we get a great response to these five, in coming months, we'll announce LA, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, Austin, Nashville and some other cities. (So even if it's not your city, I hope you'll tell people who might be interested).

Do you have a media channel strategy? (You should.),"Twenty years ago, only big companies and TV stars worried about media channels.
Oprah was on TV, then she added radio. Two channels. Then a magazine.
Pepsi set out to dominate TV with their message, and billboards and vending machines. Newspapers, not so much. The media you chose to spread your message mattered. In fact, it could change what you made and how you made it. [Stop for a second and consider that… the media channel often drove the product and pricing and distribution].
Today, of course, everyone has access to a media channel. You can create a series of YouTube videos, or have a blog. You can be a big-time tweeter, or lead a significant tribe on Facebook.
Harder to grapple with is the idea that the media channel you choose changes who you are and what you do. Tom Peters gives a hundred or more speeches a year, around the world, for good money (and well earned). But this channel, this place where he can spread his message, determines what he does all day, impacts the pace of the work he does, informs all of his decisions.
Oprah lives a life that revolves around a daily TV show. Of course it would be difficult for her to write a book… that's a life dictated by a different channel. And she's a lapsed twitter user because it demands a different staffing and mindset than she has now.
This applies to non-celebs, to people with jobs, to entrepreneurs, to job seekers. We all spread our ideas, at least a little, and the medium you choose willchangeyour ideas. If you only pay attention to the world when you need a new job (your channel is stamps and your message is your resume) you'll spend your day differently than if you are leading a tribe, participating in organizations or giving local speeches all the time.

The sugar cane machine,"A small island grows sugar cane. Many people harvest it, and one guy owns the machine that can process the cane and turn it into juice.
Who wins?
The guy with the machine, of course. It gives him leverage, and since he's the only one, he can pay the pickers whatever he likes–people will either sell it to him or stop picking. No fun being the cane picker. He can also charge whatever he likes to the people who need the cane juice, because without him, there's no juice. No fun being a baker or cook.
But now, a second machine comes to the island, and then three more. There are five processors.
Who wins?
Certainly not the guy with the first machine. He has competitors for the cane. He can optimize and work on efficiency, but pretty soon he's going to be in a price war for his raw materials (and a price war for the finished product.) Not so much fun to be the factory owner.
And then! And then one cane processor starts creating a series of collectible containers, starts interacting with his customers and providing them with custom blends, starts offering long-term contracts and benefits to his biggest customers, and yes, even begins to pay his growers more if they're willing to bring him particularly sweet and organic materials, on time. In short, he becomes a master of the art of processing and marketing cane. He earns permission, he treats different customers differently and he refuses to act like a faceless factory…

A little later, when we're more mature, we might define winning as getting what we want at the expense of someone else. I win when you lose. And yes, winning still means now, not later.
A demagogue cares so much about winning that he'd rather wreck the system itself than lose. It's okay, he believes, to root for the failure of the republic or to destroy civility or democracy if it leads to something that could be called a win.
What happens when you define a win as getting closer to someone who wants the same thing? Or when you define it as improvement over time? Or in creating trust?
What if the win is the ability to give a true gift?","June 29, 2010","winning, maturity, trust"
BACO and your career,"Brian Trelstad and his team at Acumen have had great success using a metric they callBACO(the best alternative charitable option). They can compare the results of the development and investment work they do to the results that direct aid or charity would generate instead. In short: when you understand the alternative, it's far easier to not only measure your work, but value it.
If you are familiar with a great restaurant just down the street, that raises the bar for a new restaurant to get your business…
If you live in a one-company town and have but one skill, you don't have a lot of options. The boss tells you what to do and you do it. On the other hand, if you're a world-class Ruby on Rails programmer with a reputation on Stack Overflow, you have plenty of options, and as a result, your boss treats you with more respect… and you can be a lot more choosy about which projects you take on (realizing, of course, that you stake your reputation on everything you do.)
Call it your BAPO… best alternative professional option. It changes your posture when you have an option. If you've got another client more interesting or better paying than this one, you can confidently act that way–it raises the bar in the way people treat you. When St. Luke's was the hottest ad agency in the UK, they made the decision not to grow–in order to take a new client, they had to fire an old one. What do you think that did to the behavior of the current clients?
Corporations and organizations brainwashed generations of people to believe that they had no option. Go to school, go to the placement office, get a job, do what you're told. The amazing reality of our time is this is no longer true. And yet. And yet few people are developing their alternative, building an external reputation and yes, even moonlighting on the weekends. When you have the option, not only does your confidence change, your work does as well.","June 28, 2010","BACO, career options, professional reputation"
Validation is overrated,"If you're waiting for a boss or an editor or a college to tell you that you do good work, you're handing over too much power to someone who doesn't care nearly as much as you do.
We spend a lot of time organizing and then waiting for the system to pick us, approve of us and give us permission to do our work.
Feedback is important, selling is important, getting the market to recognize your offering and make a sale–all important. But there's a difference between achieving your goals and realizing your work matters.

Do you have the right to be heard?,"I'm not talking about theabilityto be heard… we solved that problem a few years ago. It used to be logistically impossible to make it easy for the masses to speak up and to sort and respond to the feedback. Now, though, that part is easy.
I'm wondering whether marketers, politicians and leaders have an obligation to treat everyone's input equally. Sure, you have the right to speak, but what does it take to be listened to?
Does the CEO of HP have the obligation to listen to a loony one-share shareholder with the same attention he focuses on a significant investor? Does a consulting firm have an obligation to study every RFP that comes along?
In most situations, I'd argue, youearnthe right to be heard. If there's a sick person on the plane, the doctor in 3b has the right to speak up, the hysterical person behind her does not.
So, here's a quick list of a few ways to earn that right:
On a tangential point for the recipients of this incoming flood of noise,you are not a punching bag. Some people will become your customer (or a prospect) merely because it gives them the power tocomplain. To be heard. To be paid attention to. I'm not sure you need customers like that.","June 26, 2010","right to be heard, input equality, listening obligation"
A bias for scamminess,"Avoid stamps.com.
How is that a sleepy, conservative organization like the postal service ends up licensing its brand to a company that can't resist every honey pot scheme and opt out technique in the book?
I needed to send a package today and figured I'd try them out. Visited the site on my Mac, got all the way through registration, entered my card to pay for stamps and then (and only then) did I find out their software doesn't work on a Mac. Of course, they knew I was on a Mac but didn't bother to alert me early on.
Now they have my card, but hey, it's the USPS, so I trust them. Just for kicks, I call in to ask about the Mac compatibility issue. It turns out that by entering my card to pay for stamps, I've agreed to pay them $15.95 a month. Forever. And ever. Or until I notice.
I go online to cancel my account and discover that you can't cancel your account online. You have to call them. Oh. (The people on the phone are friendly, for what it's worth…)
Can you imagine this sort of thing happening at a store? Or in a sleepy government office?
They told me that they have 400,000 paying customers. I wonder how many of them are paying a monthly fee without realizing it…

What’s included?,"This is the pricing question of our time.
First, from the buyer's point of view: when I buy this car/boiler/phone, how much are the services that come with it going to cost me every month, forever?
We stand at the Verizon store agonizing about the extra $34 in posted price for one phone over the other, then sign a contract for $2400 in fees.
We are attracted to a car with a rebate, not caring about the $2000 extra in lifetime gas costs.
More and more, the thing we buy isn't a thing, it's a subscription. The thing might as well be free.
And from the seller's point of view?
When you sell me that low-cost email service, did you also just get yourself on the hook for a lifetime of free support? What's that going to cost you?
When you take her reservation at your hotel, are you prepared to do all the work and attention you need to get a decent review on TripAdvisor? Ready for your CEO to take a call in the middle of the night, ready to comp meals, scramble teams of reps or engage in months of correspondence with that customer? Because that's all included in your marketing costs now, isn't it?
I recently hired someone to do some research and brainstorming. The first stage of what might become quite a bit of work. I was sort of amazed at the end of the short project… he asked me if I was happy with what I got, and I said, 'no.' He said, 'sorry' and walked away.
On one hand, this is dumb marketing, because he'd already done the hard work of establishing a customer, and wasn't particularly interested in turning that customer into a happy referral.
On the other hand, the old school decision to view a transaction as a transaction, time to move on to the next, is getting more and more rare. Perhaps it's an intentional act on his part, a way of doing business in the moment, without investing in or worrying about what comes as a result.",,"Pricing, Customer Experience, Subscription Economy"
You’re already self employed,"When are you going to start acting like it?

There are onlya few signs on my way through security, yet there, on the biggest of all, is a warning about snow globes. Snow globes are apparently a big enough threat/causefor confusion that they get their own sign.
Every time youinterrupt your prospect or consumer, you better ask, ""is it importantenough…"" Most of the time, it's not. Most of the time, theinterruption is a selfish, misguided effort by a committee that doesn'tget it.

A sad truth about most traditional b2b marketing,"""People who don't care, selling products to people who care less.""
I was at a conference recently where the senior executives spent the entire day talking about profits, market share and growth… they never once mentioned that the pharmaceuticals they were selling were saving lives, or that changes in the product or its pricing could reduce side effects or the load on the patient and her doctor.
This disconnect is becoming less common, but it still happens. It's okay to be passionate about what you sell, even if it's an industrial chemical. It's okay to be connected to your suppliers and vendors, even if you're spending company money to buy from them.
Many businesses focus exclusively on saving money (or so they think) when they publish an RFP and take bids for this product or that service. It's only later when they discover the sticky gas pedal or the customer angry about a stock out that they realize that paying attention to their suppliers beyond price is a good idea.
If you've ever met someone who is passionate about tax accounting or warehouse roofing systems, you understand the power that this passion can have in transforming a client. The challenge is for the supplier to hire passionate people and then give them the room and support to actually care.
""Without apology, we care about what we make and the companies (and people!) that help us make it.""
Not an easy thing to say, because if you rely on numbers alone, you get deniability. Blind bidding means you don't have to care about anything but price. An RFP means you don't have to compare apples and oranges. Anonymous business clients means you don't have to answer the phone when it's easier to send it to voice mail.
Except that caring works. On both sides.","June 21, 2010","B2B marketing, passion, supplier relationships"
Archetypes at work,"What are you, what do you want to be? When you're being your best self at your job, what are you doing? Here's a partial list:
Farmer–repeatedly and patiently optimizing the production of goods for sale, worrying about the weather
Hunter–tracking prey, balancing patience with bursts of energy
Gardener–pruning for beauty, growing enough to sustain yourself
Servant–""yes, sir""
Architect–creating a platform for others to work in or on
Nurse–healing (in any sense) other people
Shadchen–connecting others, making a match
Impresario–inventing out of nothing, putting on a show and selling tickets
Conductor–coordinating, leading and shipping
Trader–buying low, selling high
Artist–seeing the world as it is, shipping gifts
Receptionist–greeting all with a content-free smile
The movie star–admired (and bizarrely, respected) for being famous and beautiful
The professor–solving interesting problems
and Mary Ann–the simple farm girl with a heart of gold (sorry, Gilligan, I got carried away)
Of course there are many jobs that include elements of more than one archetype. Deep down, though, you've probably been trained, conditioned or persuaded that one (or perhaps a combo of a few) of these work missions is just right for you.
It's interesting that the most common (in terms of jobs available) is by far the servant, and just about all the others require an insane amount of personal responsibility and initiative. Just because you work on a farm doesn't mean you're a farmer–not if someone else tells you what to do all day.
Worth noting: very few jobs match the archetypes they share a name with. Nurses, for example, don't get to spend much time at all doing actual nursing. If an archetype calls to you, don't be fooled by a job that appears to match it but doesn't.
You can change what you do if you choose to, but not if you keep seeking out the same archetype.","June 20, 2010","Archetypes, Work, Career"
"Gifts, misunderstood","What's a gift?
I met a big-shot former Fortune 500 company CEO who explained to me that he used to have three secretaries. One for his calendar, one for his usual work, and one who did nothing but send people gifts.
I think when it's sent by a corporation and chosen by a secretary, it's not a gift. It's a present. Or a favor…
A gift certificate from a rich uncle is a present as well, it's not really a gift.
A favor is something we do for someone hoping for an equal or greater favor in return. (Hence the phrase, ""return the favor."" No one says, ""return the gift."")
A present is something that costs money, sure, and it's free, but I don't think it's a gift.
A gift costs the giver something real. It might be cash (enough that we feel the pinch) but more likely it involves a sacrifice or a risk or an emotional exposure. A true gift is a heartfelt connection, something that changes both the giver and the recipient.
The Gift of the Magiis a greatstorybecause each person in the story sacrifices to create a heartfelt gift for the other person. And it's gifts–gifts that touch us, gifts that change us–that are transforming the way we interact.
One or two readers asked me why my bookLinchpincosts money. After all, they ask, if gifts are a cornerstone of the new era, why not give it away free, as a gift?
Free doesn't make something a gift. Free might be a marketing strategy, free might make a generous present, but free doesn't automatically make something a gift. Gil Scott Heron's newalbumisn't free, but it's a gift. He's exposing himself. Taking a risk. You listen to the album and you feel differently when you're done… it's not a product, it's a very personal statement. Keller Williams approaches his entirecraftas a chance to give gifts, but that doesn't mean he can't charge for some elements of his work. What it took him to create the music is so much greater than what it cost you to consume it that he is giving gifts without doubt.
The way I understand gifts is that the giver must make a sacrifice, create an uneven exchange, bring himself closer to the recipient, create change and do it all with the right spirit. To do anything less might be smart commerce, but it doesn't rise to the magical level of the gift. A day's work for a day's pay is the win/lose mantra of the industrial era. More modern is to view a day's work as a chance to generate gifts that last.","June 19, 2010","Gifts, Sacrifice, Transformation"
Slick,"For a long time, the best way to tell if something was professional, high grade and worth a premium was by judging the slickness of the production values.
The Bourne Identity cost more to make than The Toxic Avenger. John Grisham's latest novel was clearly worth more than a self-published typewritten book of poetry. Sergeant Pepper was a more professional album than something from the Skinny Americans, that garage band down the street.
And so, restaurants got slicker, as did business proposals. We looked for cues on websites or in the way a conference was presented and the stage was dressed.
Now of course, there's autotune and ProTools, which can make any band sound like Britney. There's Kinko's and Moo cards and plenty of people who will sell you gloss for not so much money.
So I guess instead of slick we're now seeking transparency and reputation and guts.","June 18, 2010","slickness, production values, transparency"
Amplifying the lizard brain,"Not sure why you would want to reinforce the noise in your head that tells you not to speak up, stand out and do work that matters, but if you do, a surefire way to do it is to focus your attention on every piece of negative feedback in your environment.

Or to carefully study anonymous comments, tweets and online reviews from people who don't like the work you're doing. Or focus on the one paragraph in your annual review called 'weaknesses'. Or spend the day thinking about the one slip of the tongue you made this morning…
You can listen to your customers murmur about you online, except that pleased customers tell a few people, angry ones tell everyone. So it's really easy to misinterpret a few as a deluge.

Goodbye to the office,"Factories used to be arranged in a straight line. That's because there was one steam engine, and it turned a shaft.

Hope and the magic lottery,"Entrepreneurial hope is essential. It gets us over the hump and through the dip. There's a variety of this hope, though, that's far more damaging than helpful.
This is the hope of the magic lottery ticket.
A fledgling entrepreneur ambushes a venture capitalist who just appeared on a panel. ""Excuse me,"" she says, then launches into a two, then six and eventually twenty minute pitch that will never (sorry, never) lead to the VC saying, ""Great, here's a check for $2 million on your terms.""
Or the fledgling author, the one who has been turned down by ten agents and then copies his manuscript and fedexes it to twenty large publishing houses–what is he hoping for, exactly? Perhaps he's hoping to win the magic lottery, to be the one piece of slush chosen out of a million (literally a million!) that goes on to be published and revered.
You deserve better than the dashed hopes of a magic lottery.
There's a hard work alternative to the magic lottery, one in which you can incrementally lay the groundwork and integrate into the system you say you want to work with. And yet instead of doing that work, our instinct is to demonize the person that wants to take away our ticket, to confuse the math of the situation (there are very few glass slippers available) with someone trying to slam the door in your faith/face.
You can either work yourself to point where you don't need the transom, or you can play a different game altogether, but throwing your stuff over the transom isn't worthy of the work you've done so far.
Starbucks didn't become Starbucks by getting discovered by Oprah Winfrey or being blessed by Warren Buffet when they only had a few stores. No, they plugged along. They raised bits of money here and there, flirted with disaster, added one store and then another, tweaked and measured and improved and repeated. Day by day, they dripped their way to success. No magic lottery.
What chance is there that Mark Cuban or Carlos Slim is going to agree to be your mentor, to open all doors and give you a shortcut to the top? Better, I think, to avoid wasting a moment of your time hoping for a fairy godmother. You're in a hurry and this is a dead end.
When someone encourages you to avoid the magic lottery, they're not criticizing your idea nor are they trying to shatter your faith or take away your hope. Instead, they're pointing out that shortcuts are rarely dependable (or particularly short) and that instead, perhaps, you should follow the longer, more deliberate, less magical path if you truly want to succeed.
If your business or your music or your art or your project is truly worth your energy and your passion, then don't sell it short by putting its future into a lottery ticket.
Here's another way to think about it: delight the audience you already have, amaze the customers you can already reach, dazzle the small investors who already trust you enough to listen to you.

Lula’s logic,"When Blythe and her partners startedLula's Apothecary, the best vegan ice cream stand in this hemisphere, they didn't have enough money to afford the letters to put ""Dairy free"" on the sign in their window. They couldn't even afford ""vegan."" So the signage says nothing about what theydon'tput in their ice cream.
What they discovered was that word among the tribe of vegans in the East Village of New York City (an even bigger group than you might imagine) spread fast. The product was remarkable enough that just a few happy customers were enough to spread the word.
The other thing they discovered is that non-vegans were willing to walk on in if the place looked cool enough. In fact, the lack of ingredient-declaration on their window actually helped them reach out to people who might have been scared away at the lack of milk.
Ink on the website is free, so they use the v-word there, but even though they can now afford it, the window is still proudly mute on their rigor regarding ingredients.

Fear of shipping,"Shipping is fraught with risk and danger.
Every time you raise your hand, send an email, launch a product or make a suggestion, you're exposing yourself to criticism. Not just criticism, but the negative consequences that come with wasting money, annoying someone in power or making a fool of yourself.
It's no wonder we're afraid to ship.
It's not clear you have much choice, though. A life spent curled in a ball, hiding in the corner might seem less risky, but in fact it's certain to lead to ennui and eventually failure.
Since you're going to ship anyway, then, the question is: why bother indulging your fear?

You can turn your idea (like a focus on entrepreneurs) into cooltrading cards, like Evan did.
You can skip the printing altogether and start your ownvideo university, like Khan Academy.

Cheating the clock,"One way to do indispensable work is to show up more hours than everyone else. Excessive face time and candle-burning effort is sort of rare, and it's possible to leverage it into a kind of success.
But if you're winning by cheating the clock, you're still cheating.
The problem with using time as your lever for success is that it doesn't scale very well. 20 hours a day at work is not twice as good as 18, and you certainly can't go much beyond 24…
What would happen if you were prohibited from working more than five hours a day. What would you do? How would you use those five hours to become indispensable in a different way?
Go ahead, try it. Just for a week. See what happens. Even if you go back to ten, you'll discover you've changed the way you compete.",,"Time management, productivity, work-life balance"
Hourly work vs. linchpin work,"There's a gulf between hourly work and linchpinwork.
You should pay people by the hour when there are available substitutes. When you rely on freelancers you can put a value on their time based on what themarket is paying. If there are six podiatrists in town, and all can heal your foot, the going rate is based on their time and effort, not on the lifetime use of your foot.
On the other hand, if there are no short term substitutes, then you don't pay what the market will bear, instead you pay what someone is worth. Big difference.
Consider, for example, someone putting together a series of concerts for which they intend to sell subscriptions or even have the musicians sell tickets.
They could seek out pretty good musicians and imagine that paying them $500 or more per hour is very fair compensation. After all, that's more than a podiatrist gets, and she gives you back the use of your foot.
But when they find a linchpin, someone who will either make it easier for them to sell subscriptions or will bring an audience with them, thequestion isn't how much time it took for the musician to do her set, the question is what did shebring in terms of value, right? An indispensable person, someone with a rare asset, has few substitutes and an hourly rate makes a lot less sense.
So, if a musician is going to sell 300 subscriptions for you and you earn $200 a subscriptionfrom that effort, that person just added $60,000 worth of value. Whocares if it took a minute or a day? What's on the table is who gets whatportion of the value added…
I had a college professor who did engineering consulting. A brand new office tower in Boston had a serious problem–there was a brown stain coming through the drywall, (allof the drywall) no matter how much stain killer they used. In a forty story building, if you have to rip out all the drywall, this is a multi-million dollar disaster. They had exhausted all possibilities and were a day away from tearing out everything and taking a loss. They hired Henry in a last-ditch effort to solve the problem. He looked at the walls and said, ""I think I can work out a solution, but it will cost you $45,000 if I succeed."" They instantly signed on, because if he succeeded, the project would be saved.
Henry asked for a pencil and paper and wrote the name of a common hardware store chemical and handed it to them. ""Here, this will work."" And then he billed them $45,000. That's quite an hourly wage. It's also quite a bargain.","June 9, 2010","Hourly work, linchpin work, value creation"
Spending money to (make/lose) money,"When I was a struggling freelancer, I hated to spend money. I hired myself to do everything possible, because money I spent was money I didn't get to keep.
When I was hiring researchers to find great leads for my first internet company, I loved to spend money. Every penny we spent made us four pennies, so I spent as many pennies as I possibly could.
And there's the key distinction between two approaches to money.
If you build a business that processes inputs (leads, articles, code, attention, visitors, employees) and produces outputs that work, you want as many as you can possibly find. And if you view the world as a small pie with a finite number of pieces, better not spend on anything you can possibly avoid.
The trick is this: if your business isn't working as you hope, perhaps it's because you need to flip your approach.
Is it an expense or an asset? Is it a tax or an opportunity? Is it an investment or a risk?
It turns out that people have a very difficult time making the leap. Big company executives leave their jobs to start little companies but keep spending like money doesn't matter. Freelancers skimp on spending that would certainly pay off, and quickly.
This simple decision needs to be an intentional one.","June 8, 2010","spending, investment, business mindset"
Paperback Kindle,"Steve Jobs reports today that Apple is selling an iPad every three seconds.
This is a pretty urgent moment for my friends on the Kindle team, so here are some bonus thoughts on pricing, business models and competition:
1. The paperback Kindle. Don't worry about touchscreens or color or even always available internet to download new books. Make a $49 Kindle. Not so hard if you use available wifi and simplify the device. Make it the only ebook reader in town.
2. The Kindle as razor. Buy any 8 bestselling books on the Kindle ($10 each) and get a paperback Kindle for free.
3. Kindle of the month club. In the 1950s, the most powerful person in all publishing was the guy who chose the book for the book of the month club. It didn't pay the author glamorously well, but if your book was chosen, it guaranteed people would talk and it would become a bestseller.
Sign up to get a Kindle book of your choice every month for 12 months and get a free Kindle. Amazon presents you with ten book choices, and since the cost of delivering it is zero, there's plenty of margin for all…
4. Let publishers, leaders and corporations push PDFs and chosen books directly to their tribes via the Kindle. For example, I could put Kindles in the hands of the 1,000 service techs of my ventilation company and they'd see the new service manual daily. Or an author could create her own version of a book club, collecting a monthly fee and pushing the latest book directly to people who want to read it. Simpler still, how about letting me gift a book directly to anyone I know who has a Kindle? (thanks Lisa, for this idea).
The only way to get authors and publishers to embrace this device is to sell 20,000,000 of them. You either become the best and only platform for consuming books worth buying or you fail. And the only way to create that footprint in the face of an iPad is to make it so cheap to buy and use it's irresistible.
I saw a two-year old kid (in diapers, in a stroller), using an iPod Touch today. Not just looking at it, but browsing menus and interacting. This is a revolution, guys.","June 7, 2010","Kindle, pricing, competition"

Drill baby drill,"I used to see a black Hummer driving around town, complete with a ""Drill, baby drill"" bumper sticker.
What a fabulous slogan.
Slogans are fabulous when they use few words (two! one used twice) to unite, energize and signify a tribe. You're either an insider or an outsider, but there were no fence sitters on this one. The slogan captured a can-do, engineering-centric, please-get-out-of-my-way, anti-intellectual, regulate-industry-less mindset that this driver (and presumably others in his tribe) could broadcast and be motivated by. In three words! A key part of the slogan is the extraneous word 'baby', which reinforces theinformality, the certainty and the impatience with bureaucracy. Support it or not, you have to agree that it was a great slogan. (Until it wasn't).
Like most good political slogans, it called for something to happen in the future, something someone else would do and be responsible for, nothing that could come home to roost in a really short time. Of course, few could predict how close the future actually was. Ideally, next time you'd pick a slogan that had a much longer expiration date.","June 5, 2010","slogan, energy, mindset"
Seized of the matter,"The Security Council of the UN often ends resolutions with the obscure phrase,""remains seized of the matter"".
Turns out that the entire body is not supposed to debate an issue that's been seized by the Security Council. (Not that the United Nations is a role model for active problem solving… they often do their best work by exhausting everyone instead).
I think it's fascinating to think of issues as being seized. Are your issues being seized by someone else? What happens if you take something off the table and make it yours until it's dealt with?
Most important: how often does kibbitzing and committee-think slow down great work that ought to be seized and shipped instead?",,"Seized, Security Council, Decision-making"
Ism schism,"The easiest way to make noise within a community is to divide the tribe.
Modernism, classicism, realism, impressionism–dividing things into schools of thought–or even warring camps–makes it easy to create tension and thus attention.
I'm running out of patience for people who would further their personal or media goals by dividing us in exchange for a cheap point or a few votes. If members of a tribe encourage schisms and cheer on the battles, is it any wonder that it's hard to create forward motion? When we're not in sync, power is dissipated.

But you’re not saying anything,"And this is the problem with just about every lame speech, every overlooked memo, every worthless bit of boilerplate foisted on the world: you write and write and talk and talk and bullet and bullet but no, you’re not really saying anything.
It took me two minutes to find a million examples. Here’s one, “The firm will remain competitive in the constantly changing market for defense legal services by creating and implementing innovative and effective methods of providing cost-effective, quality representation and services for our clients.”

What inherent traits would make it easier for someone to becoming a linchpin? Surely not everyone can be a linchpin?
Why not?How dare anyone say that some people aren't somehowqualifiedto bring emotional labor to their work, somehow aren't genetically or culturally endowed with the seeds or instincts or desires to invent new techniques or ideas, or aren't chosen to connect with other human beings in a way that changes them for the better?
Perhaps some people will insist that there are jobs where no humanity is possible. But you don't have to work for them.
Some people want to tell you that your DNA isn't right, or you're not from the right family or neighborhood. I think that's wrongheaded.
Bob Marley grew up in one of the poorest villages in the world. Sir Richard Branson has dyslexia that makes it difficult for him to read. Hugh Masakela grew up in Witbank, a coal mining town.

We've been culturally brainwashed to believe that the factory approach (average products for average people, compliance, focus on speed and cost) is the one and only way. It's not.
We make a difference to other people when we give gifts to them, when we bring emotional labor to the table and do work that matters. It's hard for me to imagine that this is only available to a few. Yes, the cards are unfairly stacked against too many people. Yes, there's too many barriers and not enough support. But no, your ability to create and contribute isn't determined at birth.

Is this noise inside my head bothering you?,"Not just my head, but your customer's head and yes… yours.
Everyone has multiple conversations and priorities going on, competing agendas that come into play every time we make a choice about doing, buying, creating or interacting. I think these voices (and a few I missed) determine which career wechoose, how good a job we do, where we shop and what we watch. Here are a few:

Sabotage!,"Just about all sabotage is self-sabotage.
We don't get forced to eat that cookie, we choose to. And so the diet is ended.
Marketing self-sabotage is fascinating to watch and understand. Consider the college application: it's primarily an opportunity for teenagers who aren't sure of where they want to go to undercut their chances by exposing their uncertainty. The lizard brain, the voice in the back of the head that wants security and safety–it's not eager to go to a college that might be 'too hard' or 'too good'. The easy thing to do is to scale back the effort, not do what works, but do what feels right instead.
Or consider the way we resist opportunities to lead, to connect, to do work that matters. We don't resist because we're not capable of it… we resist because if our marketing fails, if we don't get the job or earn the trust, then we're off the hook. No promises made, which means no promises to keep.
We know more than enough about marketing now. We know how to craft a story that will spread, we know how to find and lead tribes. The thing we have trouble with is making the commitment to do it even when it's frightening and difficult.","July 31, 2010","self-sabotage, marketing, commitment"

It’s (always) too soon to know for sure,"The cost of being first is higher than it's ever been…
It's entirely possible that you're racing.
Racing to the market with a new product or a news story or a decision or an innovation. The race keeps getting faster, doesn't it?
If you're racing, you better figure out what to do about the times that you don't know for sure…because more and more of your inputs are going to be tenuous, speculative and possibly wrong. Day traders have always understood this–all they do is trade on uncertainty. But you, too, if you're racing, are going to have to make decisions on less than perfect information.
Given that fact, what are you going to do about it? I think it's worth a few cycles of your time.
Is it smart to blog on a rumor?
Worth dropping everything and panicking because of a news alert?
Should you hire someone based on information you're not sure of?
What about changing your website (your pricing, your layout…) based on analytics that might not be absolutely correct? How long are you willing to wait?
Given that you will never knoweverythingfor sure (unless you're opting out of the race), some of the issues are:
Have you noticed how often stock analysts quoted in the news are wrong? Wrong about new products, wrong about management decisions, wrong about the future of a company? In fact, they're almost always first and almost always wrong.
Rule of thumb: being first helps in the short run. Being a little more right than the masses ultimately pays off in the long run. Being last is the worst of all three.

The problem with unlimited,"If you work out on a weight machine that has a limit–where you have to push the bar until it stops–you're far more likely to to hit that limit than if you had left it to your own initiative to figure out how far is far enough.
People enjoy going to the max (or in the case of Spinal Tap, a little farther than max, to 11). But if there is no max, no limit, it's much easier to satisfy yourself and declare that you've done enough.
If you want your best users to do more, one way to do it is to announce the most they can do. While this may dissuade a few people from pushing ever farther, it will in fact motivate a large number of people to up their game.

Getting unstuck: solving the perfect problem,"The only problems you have left are the perfect ones. The imperfect ones, the ones with a clearly evident solution, well, if they were important, you've solved them already.
It's the perfect problems that keep us stuck.
Perfect because they have constraints, unbendable constraints, constraints that keep us trapped. I hate my job, I need this job, there's no way to quit, to get a promotion or to get a new boss, no way to move, my family is in town, etc.
We're human, that's what we do–we erect boundaries, constraints we can't ease, and we get trapped.
Or perhaps it's your product or service or brand. Our factory is only organized to make X, but the market doesn't want X as much, or there is regulation, or a new competitor is now offering X at half the price and the board won't do anything, etc.
There's no way to solve the perfect problem because every solution involves breaking an unbreakable constraint.
And there's your solution.
The way to solve the perfect problem is to make it imperfect. Don't just bend one of the constraints, eliminate it. Shut down the factory. Walk away from the job. Change your product completely. Ignore the board.
If the only alternative is slow and painful failure, the way to get unstuck is to blow up a constraint, deal with the pain and then run forward. Fast.","July 26, 2010","perfect problems, constraints, getting unstuck"

But who will speak for the trees?,"Defenders of the status quo at newspapers, book publishers and the magazine industry are in a panic. Some are evenmisguidedlyasking for government regulation or a bailout.
All three industries are doomed (if doomed means that they will be unrecognizable in ten–probably three–years). And yet…
And yet there's no shortage of writing, or things to read. No shortage of news, either. And there doesn't appear to be one on the horizon. In fact, there's more news, more images and more writing available to more people more often than ever before in history.
No, just about all of the whining is about protecting paper, the stuff the ideas are printed on, not the ideas themselves.
It's paper that makes the economics of the newspaper industry work (or not work). It's paper that creates cost and slows things down and generates scarcity. And scarcity is what they sell.
It's paper that makes the book industry what it is. As soon as you remove paper from the equation, the costs change, the timing changes, the barriers to entry change, the risk changes. And defenders of the status quo don't like change.
Is there not enough paper in your life? Why are we wringing our hands about the demise of paper as the economic gating factor for ideas? In fact, some of the trees I know are delighted that we've found a better, faster, cheaper way to spread ideas.
If the demise of paper means that good people doing good work in important industries will have to find faster and better ways to do their jobs, I don't think that's a bad thing.","July 23, 2010","paper, industry change, ideas"
The art of seduction,"Carole Mallory was Norman Mailer's mistress. Seducing him probably wasn't that difficult, though, as he was already on his sixth wife at the time.
Marketers seek to seduce. So do painters, authors and job seekers. The most important thing to understand about seduction is this: it only works when the other person cooperates, contributes and is at some level interested in being seduced.
In short: it's a lot easier to seduce someone whose worldview and attitude makes them open to it. If you want to be successful at whatever form of seduction you have in mind, seek out the right people.
Some people were seduced by the iPad. Many ignored it. It wasn't that the iPad changed from person to person, what changed was the audience's worldview and openness.

Getting to scale: direct marketing vs. mass market thinking,"A mass marketer needs to reach the masses, and to do it in many ways, simultaneously. The mass marketer needs retail outlets and fliers and a website and public relations and tv ads and more more more and then… bam… critical mass is reached and success occurs.
Best Buy is a mass marketer, but so are Microsoft and the Red Cross. Ubiquity, once achieved, brings them revenue, which advances the cycle and they reach scale.
The direct marketer, on the other hand, must get it right in the small. That pitch letter can be tested on 100 houses and if it gets a 2% response rate, then it can be mailed to 100,000 houses with confidence. That business-to-business sales pitch can be honed on one or two or three prospects, and then when it works, can be taught to dozens or hundreds of other salespeople.
The key distinction iswhenyou know it's going to work. The mass marketer doesn't know until the end. The direct marketer knows in the beginning.
The mass marketer is betting on thousands of tiny cues, little clues, and unrecorded (but vital) conversations. The direct marketer is measuring conversion rates from the first day.
That's the reason we often default to acting like mass marketers. We're putting off the day of reckoning, betting on the miracle around the corner, spending our time and energy on the early steps without the downside of admitting failure to the boss.
Of course, just because it's our default doesn't mean it's right. Business to business marketing is almost always better if you treat it like direct marketing. Most websites that do conversion as well. Same with non-profit fundraising. As well as marketing goods and services to the bottom of the pyramid, people who live in villages where mass media and mass distribution are difficult and have little impact.
Get it right for ten people before you rush around scaling up to a thousand. It's far less romantic than spending money at the start, but it's the reliable, proven way to get to scale if you care enough to do the work.","July 21, 2010","Direct marketing, mass marketing, scaling"
The paradox of promises in the age of word of mouth,"Word of mouth is generated by surprise and delight (or anger). This is a function of the difference between what you promise and what you deliver (see clever MBA chart to the right—>).
The thing is, if you promise very little, you don't get a chance to deliver because I'll ignore you. And if you promise too much, you don't get a chance to deliver, because I won't believe you…
Hence the paradox. The more you promise, the less likely you are to achieve delight and the less likely you are to earn the trust to get the gig in the first place. Salespeople often want you to allow them to overpromise, because it gets them through the RFP. Marketers, if they're smart, will push you (the CEO) to underpromise, since that's where the word of mouth is going to come from.
I have worked with someone who is very good at the promising part. She enjoys it. And when the promises don't work out, she's always ready with the perfect excuse. This is a great strategy if you have a regular job and the excuses are really terrific, but if you need internal or external clients, it gets old pretty fast. It certainly doesn't lead to the sort of word of mouth one is eager to encounter.
Surgeons have this problem all the time. They promise a complete, pain-free recovery and work hard to build up a positive expectation, particularly for elective surgery. And the entire time you're in bed, in pain, unable to pee, all you can do is hate on the doctor.
This is one reason why recovering from failure is such a great opportunity. If you or your organization fail and then you pull out all the stops to recover or make good, the expectation/delivery gap is huge. You don't win because you did a good job, you win because you so dramatically exceeded expectations.","July 20, 2010","promises, word of mouth, expectations"

Self marketing might be the most important kind,"What story do you tell yourself about yourself?
I know that marketers tell stories. We tell them to clients, prospects, bosses, suppliers, partners and voters. If the stories resonate and spread and seduce, then we succeed.
But what about the story you tell yourself?
Do you have an elevator pitch that reminds you that you're a struggling fraud, certain to be caught and destined to fail? Are you marketing a perspective and an attitude of generosity? When you talk to yourself, what do you say? Is anyone listening?
You've learned through experience that frequency works. That minds can be changed. That powerful stories have impact.

Is everything perfect?,"Greetings have traditionally been an acknowledgment of the other person. ""I see you."" ""Hello."" ""Greetings.""
Then, we moved on to, ""how are you?"" or even, ""how's business?""
Recently, though, our performance-obsessed, live-forever society has morphed the greeting into something like, ""please list everything going on in your life that isn't as perfect as it should be.""
In a business setting, this causes bad prioritization decisions. The owner of the bar says to the manager, ""how was the night?"" and the response is, ""the cash register came up $8 short."" Suddenly, there's an urgent problem to be solved. How to replace the eight dollars and who do we fire?
If the question instead had been, ""what's up?"" (as in literallyup) the answer might have been, ""well, there's a big party at table 12, another going away party. They've been buying champagne all night. And Mary told me she set a new record for tips. And the new beer we added on tap is…""
Highlighting what's working helps you make that happen more often.

The management of signals,"There are two things we can get better at:
1. Getting accurate signals from the world. Right now, we take in information from many places, but we're not particularly focused on filtering the information that might be false, and more important, what might be missing.
2. Sorting and ranking information based on importance. We often make the mistake of ranking things as urgent, which aren't, or true, which are false, or knowable, when they're not.
Dealing successfully with times of change (like now) requires that you simultaneously broaden your reach, focus on what's important and aggressively ignore things that are both loud and false.

A hierarchy of failure worth following,"Not all failures are the same. Here are five kinds, from frequency = good all the way to please-don't!

FAIL FREQUENTLY: Prototypes. Spreadsheets. Sample ads and copy.
FAIL OCCASIONALLY: Working mockups. Playtesting sessions. Board meetings.
FAIL RARELY: Interactions with small groups of actual users and customers.
FAIL NEVER: Keeping promises to your constituents.
The thing is, in their rush to play it safe and then their urgency to salvage everything in the face of an emergency, most organizations do precisely the opposite. They throw their customers or their people under the bus (""we had no choice"") but rarely take the pro-active steps necessary to fail quietly, and often, in private, in advance, when there's still time to make things better.

Information about information,"The first revolution hit when people who made stuff started to discover that information was often as valuable as the stuff itself. Knowing where something was or how it performed or how it interacted with you can be worth more than the item itself.
Frito Lay dominates the snack business because of the information infrastructure they built on top of their delivery model. 7 Eleven in Japan dominated for a decade or more because they used information to change their inventory. Zara in Europe is an information business that happens to sell clothes.
You've probably already guessed what's now: information about information. That's what Facebook and Google and Bloomberg do for a living. They create a meta-layer, a world of information about the information itself.
And why is this so valuable? Because it compounds. A tiny head start in access to this information gives you a huge advantage in the stock market. Or in marketing. Or in fundraising.
Many people and organizations are contributing to this mass of data, but few are taking advantage of the opportunity to collate it and present it to people who desperately need it. Think about how much needs to be sorted, compared, updated and presented to people who want to choose or learn or trade on it.

It turns out, though, that if we go upstream and alter the stuff that comes to us, it's a lot easier to do great work. And if we go downstream and teach people how to work with what we created, the final product is better as well. Now, it's more of a –> [   box   ] <–.
A doctor can consider her work in the box of the examining room. But if she figures out how to get people to quit smokingbeforethey come in, her results are better. If she figures out how to get people to take their medsafterthey leave, same thing.
A designer who receives a better project brief will deliver better work. A manufacturer who figures out how to teach users to use the object properly will get better word of mouth…
Marketers, of course, can have the biggest box of all. So the stuff we think of as 'marketing' can be altered long before the person ever sees an ad, and have an impact long after they've got the product.
The challenge lies in spending a lot of time and money on the upstream and downstream parts of the work, instead of always assuming that your [box] is just what happens inside your cubicle, or as a direct result of your actions.","July 14, 2010","Upstream, Downstream, Workflow"
Two kinds of schooling,"Type 1. You can take a class where you learn technique, facts and procedures.
Type 2. You can take a class where you learn to see, learn to lead and learn to solve interesting problems.
The first type of teaching isn't particularly difficult to do, and it's something most of us are trained to absorb. The first type of schooling can even be accomplished with self-discipline and a Dummies book. The first type of class is important but not scarce.
The second kind, on the other hand, is where all real success comes from. It's really tricky to find and train people to do this sort of teaching, and anytime you can find some of it, you should grab it.
The sad thing is that we often conflate the two. We think we're hiring someone to do the second type, a once in a lifetime teacher, someone who will change the outlook of stellar students. But then we give them rules and procedures and feedback that turn them into a type 1 teacher.
Even worse, we often pay as if we're getting the scarce and valuable type 2 teachers but we end up hiring and managing type 1 teachers.
I spend a lot of time in colleges and other teaching institutions. Over and over I see the same thing–organizations that have painted themselves into a corner, keeping themselves busy but refusing to do the difficult work of teaching people to see. The dean of one college was so stuck in his type-1ness that he couldn't even bring himself to participate in a session run by a gifted type 2 teacher.
Is there anything more important to you and your organization (or your kids or your town) than figuring out how to obtain and share the wisdom that real teaching can deliver?","July 13, 2010","schooling, teaching methods, education quality"
The big sort,"Kevin Kelly argues that the most important breakthrough in the history of mankind was the invention of language.
Before language, we were wild animals. After language, humans as a species took a huge leap forward. Language allowed us to coordinate, to teach and to learn.
The second great breakthrough on this axis was writing. Writing is language solidified. Writing permits language to travel through time or over distances. It ensures that ideas last more than one generation.
Now, we're on the cusp of the third breakthrough, one that is proving to be as powerful as the other two. And we're living through it, not reading about it history books…
We've taken the smartest and richest people on earth, hundreds of millions of them, and put them to work sorting and organizing and polishing data.
We're sorting everything. Not just which videos are imitations of other videos, but identifying local breakthroughs and spreading them around the world, highlighting problems or insights and leveraging them and connecting resources to each other in ways that create massive amounts of leverage.
Think about all those folks checking their Blackberry, upvoting Digg articles, retweeting links and connecting people to ideas online. Think about the human enabled filtering, a giant system working without obvious compensation.
Right now, the big sort focuses on finding clever viral videos, but it won't for long. The power of this coordination is so huge it won't stop with building Wikipedia and turning the founder of ChatRoulette into a millionaire. Instead, the big sort will relentlessly find and connect and spread ideas that generate productivity and impact.","July 12, 2010","language, sorting, coordination"
So easy to talk about lunch,"If you want to get things moving at a meeting or in an online forum, start discussing what to order for lunch. Even the most reticent attendee has something to contribute.
Same thing when you start discussing the logo for your new venture, or what to call the subcommittee on committees… Have you noticed how many people are willing to weigh in on redecorating your office?
It's so easy to speak up on the things that are trivial, defensible, matters of taste. So easy to imagine that you're a valuable contributor because you're willing to share your personal taste on a matter that's beyond reproach.
If I want your opinion, I'm going to want it for something where you might be wrong, for something that actually makes a difference and most of all, for something where you are putting yourself at risk. Not lunch.","July 11, 2010","engagement, decision-making, triviality"
Insubordinate… 50th anniverary free ebook,"What’s the opposite of insubordinate? I guess it’ssubordinate.
Which is better, I wonder. Is it preferred to do exactly what you’re told, to be clearly subordinate to the system, to the boss, to the short term demands of the organization–or are we better off doing the right thing instead?
As I think about the insubordinate people I’ve worked with over the last few decades, the answer is really clear to me.

It’s not my birthday,"Not any more.
Some of you may have discovered that today is supposed to be my birthday. No longer. I've never really liked birthday hoopla, especially mine, so I've given my birthday to Scott and the folks atCharity:water.
If you go to the specialpagethey created and buy a well for a village that doesn't have one, you can supply clean water to two people for twenty years. If just a thousand of the readers of this blog do it, we could alter the lives of tens of thousands of people for a generation, and we could do it in just one day.  I'm not asking you to do it as a favor to me (that would be silly) but as a favor to you. Because it feels good and because $50 is a screaming bargain–100% goes directly to the well, zero overhead.
In general, I think trade is better than aid, and creating scalable investments that engage the developing world is the best shortcut to bring us all out of poverty. But without a stable infrastructure, none of that works, and water is a key building block in that platform. The key is creating a dependable, long-term supply that communities can count on, and you can be part of that.
I can't tell you how relieved I am to be done with my birthday. Maybe charity day will catch on, with lots of people giving away their birthdays, replacing noise makers and pointy hats. If you've got either the noise makers or the hats, or even digital birthday wishes, send them to Scott, not me.
Happy charity day.

"Fans, participants and spectators","A good preacher ought to be able to get 70% of the people who showed up on Sunday to make a donation.
A teeny bop rock group might convert 20% of concert goers to buy a shirt or souvenir.
A great street magician can get 10% of the people who watch his show to throw a dollar in the hat.
Direct marketers used to shoot for 2% conversion from a good list, but now, that's a long shot.
A blogger might convert 2% of readers to buy a book. (I'm aghast at this).
And a twitter user with a lot of fans will be lucky to get one out of a thousand to click a link and buy something. (.1%)
Likes, friendlies and hits are all fast-growing numbers that require little commitment. And commitment is the essence of conversion. The problem with commitment is that it's frightening (for both sides). And so it's easy to avoid. We just click and move on.
I think there's a transparent wall, an ever bigger one, between digital spectators and direct interaction or transaction. The faster the train is moving, the harder it is to pay attention, open the window and do business. If all you're doing is increasing the number of digital spectators to your work, you're unlikely to earn the conversion you deserve.","July 9, 2010","conversion, engagement, digital interaction"
Updates,"Over the last few months, I've tried experimenting with leveragedways to teach and engage, and I thought it would be worth doing a recap.The short version: digital tools make it easier than ever to createevents and experiences that work–without the risky staffing andtrappings and overhead that used to be required.
THE ROAD TRIP: In two weeks I'll be in DC for the second in a series ofall-day interactive events. Minnesota is in August and Chicago is September. You can see video and photos from the first event in Bostonhere. (There are less than 12 full-day seats left in DC and perhaps six in Chicago…) The people I met in Boston were amazing, and the volunteers who pitched in made the event sing (I think you'll enjoy their page). The juxtaposition of a large group in the morning and a more intimate group for the rest of the day makes it interesting.

I think we've overlooked what a sea change has occurred in just a few years, when anyone with an idea can expose it directly to the rest of the world.

Low esteem and the factory,"If you want to hire people to do a job, to be cogs in the system and to do what they're told, you might want to focus on people who don't think very highly of themselves.
People with low self esteem might be more happy to be bossed around, timed, abused, misused and micromanaged, no?
And the converse is true as well. If you want to raise your game and build an organization filled with people who will change everything, the first thing to look for is someone who hasn't been brainwashed into believing that they're not capable of great work.
A harried teacher might find it easier to teach a class to obey first and think second, but is that sort of behavior valuable or scarce now?
Industries that need to subjugate women or demonstrate power over one class of person or another are always on the lookout for people they can diminish. Our task, then, is to find people we can encourage and nurture until they're as impatient with average as we are.
The paradox is that the very people that are the easiest to categorize, to command and to dominate are the last people we want to work with.","July 8, 2010","self-esteem, empowerment, organizational culture"
Payola,"For twenty years, theBillboardcharts were easy to manipulate. By paying radio stations and some retailers, record labels could push an act to the top 40, which would increase sales. People liked buying what they heard on the radio, and the radio played what they thought people were buying.
Billboardchanged their methods about twenty years ago, and overnight the acts on the list changed. Suddenly, it became clear that what we were listening to wasn't what we thought it was, and as a result, the marketing of music changed forever.
The New York Timesbestseller list is even more easily manipulated thanBillboardever was. It doesn't cost much to scam it and it's pretty straightforward to buy your way onto the list (I know authors who have done this and consultants who sell this service.) You can hire a bunch of old ladies who will go into the 'right' stores and buy books on the right day. As a result of this distortion, the books on the list get more promoted, and thus sell more copies. It's not pretty but it's true. TheTimesis well aware that this is going on, that the list isn't accurate, but they persist in publishing lists that are demonstrably wrong. (I still find this amazing, but it's true).
Manipulating social networks is easier still. There are firms that manipulate which stories are posted and which blogs are linked to, and for years there are firms that have worked to manipulate which links come up higher on the search results as well. As these signposts become more, not less, important, there's a significant market opportunity for someone who can, asBillboarddid, clean up the charts and make the payola worthless or at least more transparent. In the meantime, be skeptical.","July 7, 2010","Payola, Manipulation, Billboard Charts"
Betting on smarter (or betting on dumber),"Marketers fall into one of two categories:
A few benefit when they make their customerssmarter. The more the people they sell to know, the more informed, inquisitive, free-thinking and alert they are, the better they do.
And most benefit when they work to make their customersdumber. The less they know about options, the easier they are to manipulate, the more helpless they are, the better they do.
Tim O'Reillydoesn't sell books. He sells smarts. The smarter the world gets, the better he does.
The vast majority of marketers, though, take the opposite tack. Ask them for advice about their competitors, they turn away and say ""I really wouldn''t know."" Ask them for details about their suppliers, and they don't want to tell you. Ask them to show you a recipe for how to make what they make on your own, and ""it's a trade secret."" Their perfect customer is someone in a hurry, with plenty of money and not a lot of knowledge about their options.
You've already guessed the punchline–if just one player enters the field and works to make people smarter, the competition has a hard time responding with a dumbness offensive. They can obfuscate and run confusing ads, but sooner or later, the inevitability of information spreading works in favor of those that bet on it.","July 6, 2010","marketing, customer intelligence, manipulation"
What’s the point?,"An idea turns into a meeting and then it turns into a project. People get brought along, there's free donuts, there's a whiteboard and even a conference call.
It feels like you're doing the work, but at some point, hopefully, someone asks, ""what's the point of this?""
Is it worth doing?
Compared to everything else we could be investing (don't say 'spending') our time on, is this the scariest, most likely to pay off, most important or the best long-term endeavor?

The theory of the case,"Here's a way to get more strategic.
Instead of arguing for a course of action based on the status quo or your emotional gut, describe the theory of the case.
A is true.
B is true.
If we do C, then A and B should permit us to get D.
The method of this strategic analysis is that you expose your assumptions, you describe your actions and your posit the results. This permits your teammates to supply facts that might change your analysis.
Wait, A isn't true.
Wait, we're not capable of doing C.
Wait, if we did C, it's not clear we would get D. Tell us how that would work…
This is far more useful than saying, ""I hate you, you're an idiot."" By making your assumptions and logic clear, you allow a more productive conversation to take place at the same time get buy in from your teammates who might be coming from a different worldview than you do.
Even better, you can then weave the case into a story, a vivid one that resonates.
If any of your steps involve doing something that's never been done before, you'll know where you need to focus your energy.
Too often, people fixate on a result they want and presume that if they just try really hard (with good intent) then maybe it'll happen.
PS if one of the steps is, ""and then a miracle happens,"" you probably need to work on your case a bit.","July 4, 2010","strategic analysis, assumptions, productive conversation"
The non-optimized life,"When you measure an activity, you can improve it. Computers make it easy to optimize just about every portion of your life.
Surely, you can optimize a website or a blog for traffic. You can optimize ads to make them yield more results. You can optimize your presentation style to close more sales or change more minds. You can optimize your workout to get faster and stronger. You can optimize your diet to lose weight and gain muscle. You can optimize your sleeping patterns to get more rest in less time.Cosmoeven says you can optimize your sex life…
And then, at some point, you realize you're spending your best energy on optimization, not on creation.
This is a fine line to walk, because of course you can optimize your creation time as well! You can develop habits to amplify your best thoughts and make it likely you'll ship work that matters. I get that. But I also worry that a never-ending cycle of optimization can become a crutch, a place to hide when you really should be confronting the endless unknown, not the banal stair step of incremental optimization. While Yahoo was optimizing their home page in 2001, the guys at Google were inventing something totally new.
That's one reason I resist the temptation to optimize this blog for traffic and yield. I'd rather force myself to improve it by having the guts to write better posts instead.","July 3, 2010","optimization, creation, improvement"
The difference between running and managing a project,"If you choose to manage a project, it's pretty safe. As the manager, you report. You report on what's happening, you chronicle the results, you are the middleman.
If you choose toruna project, on the other hand, you're on the hook. It's an active engagement, bending the status quo to your will, ensuring that you ship.

The 200 slide solution,"The next time you find yourself on the hook for a 40 minute presentation (with slides!) consider, at least for a moment, a radical idea:
A slide every 12 seconds. 200 slides in all.
You're used to putting three or four bullet points on a slide. That's at least four distinct ideas, but more often, each of those ideas has three or four sub ideas to it. In other words, you're cramming 32 ideas on a slide, and you're sitting on that slide as you drone on and on. Perhaps you spice it up with some reveals or animated bullets, but it's still 32 ideas going stale before our eyes.
What if you blew it up? Just one word on a slide. Or, perhaps just one image (no cheesy stock please). Maybe you write, ""Cheaper"" on one slide and, ""More durable"" on the next…
Slides create action. When did you decide that the appropriate amount of action was six or twelve times every half hour?
How would your pace change if you had 200 slides? How much better would the integration of slides and talk be?
I don't honestly expect you to do your presentation with 200 slides. I'm hoping this exercise will help you realize that you might not needanyslides. Or that 50 or 100 slides will pick up your energy and make your argument more coherent.
But please, don't do that presentation you did last time.","July 1, 2010","presentation, slides, engagement"
Just launched: Linchpin on the Vook on the iPad,"The details are righthere. Created by Vook, based on thehardcover.
Includes new video and interviews with some interesting folks…
The long tail challenge of the iPad store is getting more and more obvious to people. The ratio of ""shelf space"" to inventory is about the worst of any retail experience in the world. There are more than 24,000 apps listed in the iPad store, and yet the front window (equivalent to the window of a bookstore) shows the user six choices. The spotlight coverflow up top shows another sixteen, fairly randomly. Meaning there's a little worse than aone in a thousandchance that your app will appear in front of someone interacting with the store at the first level.
I have no doubt that as Apple sees revenue increase from this source, they'll do a much better job of crosslinks and browsing. But, once again, the lesson of the long tail is this: you can't count on the gatekeeper to do your promotion for you. Getting picked feels like a needle in a haystack, and the value of permission, of connecting directly to people who care instead of ceding control to a middle man, is at the heart of building an asset. Someone is going to be the gatekeeper, and it should be you.","August 31, 2010","Linchpin, iPad store, long tail"
The corporate conscience,"There isn't one.
Corporations don't have a conscience, people do.
That means that every time you say, ""It's just my job,"" or ""My department has a policy,"" or ""All I do is work here,"" what you've done is abdicated responsibility–to no one.
It's convenient and even comfortable to blame the anonymous actions of many working in concert on a evanescent brand or organization, but that starts you on an inevitable race to the bottom. Organizations have more power than ever before. They are better synchronized, faster, and possess more tools to change the economy and the people in it than ever before. And the only option available to the rest of us is for individuals to take responsibility (it's not given) for what they do and how they do it.
The very same tools that permit organizations to synchronize their efforts are now available to you and to me. I guess the question is: will we use that power to humanize the systems we've created?

Don’t forget about color,"The airport in Minneapolis is expensive and reasonably thoughtful in its design.
But the signs are monochromatic. As a result, the tired traveler wanders in circles, looking for her destination. Imagine how much easier it would be to find out where you were going if every sign with the wordTAXIon it had it in yellow instead of white. Once you knew the color of where you were going, you'd just naturally scan for it.
Google and our text-based low-res online world seems to argue against color as a signal, but it's extraordinarily powerful. You don't need to make a big deal of of it, subtle is enough. Make the button you want pressed green on every page. Soon, your users will naturally gravitate to green buttons…

Senior management,"A newly-retired executive takes a job as an adjunct professor and really shakes things up. Both the school and the students are blown away by her fresh thinking and new approaches.
A forty-year old internet executive who has been running his company for decades misses one new trend after another, because he's still living in 1998.
One thing that happens to management when they get senior is that they get stuck. (As we saw with the new professor, senior isn't about old, it's about how long you've been there).
If you've been doing it forever, you discover (but may not realize) that the things that got you this power are no longer dependable.
Reliance on the tried and true can backfire (Rupert keeps missing one opportunity after another, and keeps misunderstanding the medium he works in) or it can (rarely) pay off (Steve Jobs keeps repeating the same business model again and again–it's not an accident that Apple has no real online or social media footprint. Steve believes in beautifully designed objects, closed systems and evangelizing to developers and creatives).

Sell the problem,"No business buys a solution for a problem they don't have.
And yet, most business to business marketers jump right into features and benefits, without taking the time to understand if the person on the other end of the conversation/call/letter believes they even have a problem.
My friend Marcia (we've advised each other on various projects) has a very cool idea for large professional firms. As an architect, she realized the firms were wasting time and money and efficiency in the way they use their space.Roomtagis her answer.
The challenge is this: if your big law firm or accounting firm doesn't think it has a space allocation/stuff tracking/office mapping problem, you won't be looking for a solution. You won't wake up in the morning dreaming about how to solve it, or go to bed wondering how much it's costing you to ignore it.
And so the marketing challenge is to sell the problem.
(Interesting paradox: a lot of people aren't willing to embrace that they have a problem unless they also believe that there's a solution… so part of selling a problem is hinting that there's a solution that others are using, or is right around the corner.)
Imagine, for example, getting the data and publishing a list of the top 50 firms, ranked by efficiency of space use. All of a sudden, the bottom half of the list realizes that yes, in fact, they have something that they need to work on. If you knew that your firm was paying twice as much per associate as the competition, you'd realize that there's a problem.
When a prospect comes to the table and says, ""we have a problem,"" then you're both on the same side of the table when it comes time to solve it. On the other hand, if they're at the table because you're persistent or charming, the only problem they have is, ""how do I get out of here.""","August 25, 2010","Problem Selling, B2B Marketing, Space Efficiency"
Little lies and small promises,"""I'll be out of bed in five minutes,"" is not a true statement because it's a promise not meant to be kept. It actually means, ""go away, I'm sleeping, I'll say what I need to get rid of you.""
""Your call is very important to us,"" is not a true statement either. The truth is self-evident.
""I promise I'll tell the manager about this,"" is of course not a real promise either. It might be uttered with good intent, or might be designed to get an annoying customer to go away, but still…
You can already guess the problem with little lies. They blur the line, and they lead (pretty quickly) to big lies. The worst kind of little lies are the ones you make to yourself. Once you're willing to lie to yourself, you're also willing to cheat at golf, and after that, it's all downhill.
Companies that refuse to break small promises have a much easier time keeping big promises. And they earn a reputation, one that makes their handshake worth more.
Given that expectation and trust are just about all we have left to sell, it seems to me that little lies and small promises are at the very heart of the matter. And they're a simple choice, nothing requiring an MBA or a spreadsheet.
It all depends on what you want to stand for.",,"lies, promises, trust"
The secret of the Roush effect,"When Gerald Roush died in late May, he left behind theFerrari Market Letter. This newsletter, which he started and ran, had nearly 5,000 subscribers, paying him $130 a year for a subscription. Do the math! It's a good living–even without a fancy website.
The newsletter, it appears, was not just lucrative, it was a bargain. It chronicled the pricing, whereabouts and details of just about every Ferrari ever made. If you were a buyer or a seller, you subscribed. If you wanted to run an ad, you were required to include the car's VIN, which added to Roush's voluminous database.
The Roush effect involves extraordinary domain knowledge, a market small enough to understand and diligently earning the role of data middleman. The players in the market want there to be one clearinghouse, one authority who can connect the data, see the trends and publish the conventional wisdom.
It might be a newsletter, a conference or an online database. The tactics don't matter, but the role is indispensable. If you need examples to persuade you to try this, they won't be hard to find. One of my favorites is my friend Michael'srolein the book industry. He's bigger and more important than the famous (but failing) trade journal.

Moving on,"Linchpinwill be the last book I publish in a traditional way.
One of the poxes on an author's otherwise blessed life is people who ask, ""what's your next book,"" even if some of them haven't read the last one. (Jeffdid, of course). To answer your question, this book is my next book. I think the ideas inLinchpinare my life's work, and I'm going to figure out the best way to spread those ideas, in whatever form they take. I also have some new, smaller projects in the works, and no doubt some bigger ones around the corner. [PS the best analysis of this whole thing, particularly the punchline is byMitch.]
A little background: For ten years or so, beginning in 1986, I was a book packager. Sort of like a movie producer, but for books. My team and I created 120 published books and pitched another 600 ideas, all of which were summarily rejected. Some of the published books were flops, others were huge bestsellers. It was a lot of fun. As a book packager, you wake up in the morning and say, ""what sort of book can I invent/sell/organize/write/produce today?""
It took a year or so, but I finally figured out that my customer wasn't the reader or the book buyer, it was the publisher. If the editor didn't buy my book, it didn't get published. Here's the thing: Ilikedhaving editors as my customers. These are smart, motivated and really nice people who are happy to talk with you about what they want and what they believe. Good customers to have. (In all of those years, only one publisher stole any of my ideas, no check ever bounced, and no publisher ever broke a promise to me).
When I decided to become focused on being an author, the logical thing to do was to sell to that same group of people. And it worked. I've been lucky enough to work with some great editors, and my current publisher, Portfolio, has been patient, flexible and, did I mention, patient. Adrian Zackheim, who runs the imprint, is exactly what you'd hope for, even if the architecture of his industry is fundamentally broken.
Authors need publishers because they need a customer. Readers have been separated from authors by many levels–stores, distributors, media outlets, printers, publishers–there were lots of layers for many generations, and the editor with a checkbook made the process palatable to the writer. For ten years, I had a publisher as a client (with somefunself-publishedadventuresalong the way).Twelvebestsellers later, I've thought hard about what it means to have a traditional publisher.
Traditional book publishers use techniques perfected a hundred years ago to help authors reach unknown readers, using a stable technology (books) and an antique and expensive distribution system.
The thing is–now Iknowwho my readers are. Adding layers or faux scarcity doesn't help me or you. As the medium changes, publishers are on the defensive…. I honestly can't think of a single traditional book publisher who has led the development of a successful marketplace/marketing innovation in the last decade. The question asked by the corporate suits always seems to be, ""how is this change in the marketplace going to hurt our core business?"" To be succinct: I'm not sure that I serve my audience (you) by worrying about how a new approach is going to help or hurt Barnes & Noble.
My audience does things like buy five or ten copies at a time and distribute them to friends and co-workers. They (you) forward blog posts and PDFs. They join online discussion forums. None of these things are supported by the core of the current corporate publishing model.
Since February, I've shared mythoughtsabout the future of publishing in both public forums and in private brainstorming sessions with various friends in top jobs in the publishing industry. Other than one or two insightfulmavericks, most of them looked at me like I was nuts for being an optimist. One CEO worked as hard as she could to restrain herself, but failed and almost threw me out of her office by the end. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't heartbroken at the fear I saw.
All a long way of saying that as the methods for spreading ideas and engaging with people keep changing, I can't think of a good reason to be on the defensive. It's been years since I woke up in the morning saying, ""I need to write a book, I wonder what it should be about."" Instead, my mission is to figure out who the audience is, and take them where they want and need to go, in whatever format works, even if it's not a traditionally published book.
If you're among the majority reading this that has never bought one of my books in a bookstore, not much will change. But I thought I'd share with you this fork in the road. Thanks for reading, in whatever form you choose.","August 23, 2010","Publishing, Audience Engagement, Author's Journey"
Monitoring your internal monologue,"One of the best ways we have to intuit the way others decide is to understand howwedecide. We have a voice in our heads and we assume others do too. We don't like rancid cheese and we assume others don't either.
I've met two kinds of successful intuitive marketers. The first kind has absolutely no ability to describe why people do what they do. They just know. I talked with a famous fashion designer for two hours and came away believing that she has no idea whatsoever how or why purchasing decisions are made. She has no words for it.
The other kind is an honest witness of the decision-making that goes on every day inside. ""Why did I just choose that?"" ""Why do I believe this? Is it because of something my dad said when I was three?"" ""Why did I give $100 to that charity? Why not zero? A thousand?"" This self-insight is difficult and valuable. It means that you can't take things at face value, even things that you might be more comfortable leaving unexamined, as truths. Theologians wrestle with this dilemma all the time. How can you study an idea or a trend or a belief system if you also accept it as a universal, unquestionable fact?
And so the smart marketer throws away bias and stops cheering for one outcome over another and instead quietly takes notes on herself. Notes start shallow, but if you push, you can get deeper, stripping away layers of previously unexamined instinct. You can test those notes, see if they occur in other people when you vary the inputs. And it's this series of notes and tests that give you insight on how to share your next idea.","August 22, 2010","internal monologue, decision-making, self-insight"
"Drop everything, we need you to perform in our circus","Critics and fans, passersby and the media crave a battle, a scandal and heroic stories of winning and losing.
Want to get written up on a tech blog? Just post a really angry rant about your competition.
Want to sell tickets to the hockey game? Just put a few brawlers on the team.
The media demands that a politician ""get angry"" in the face of a conflict or problem that anger won't have any effect on–but it will make a good story. Your customers demand that you stop doing what's always worked and race to follow a trend or launch a risky sideline…
When you stumble or fall, they won't say, ""sorry, we were wrong."" They'll say, ""what were you thinking!"" and talk about it even more. And then the cycle continues.","August 21, 2010","media, scandal, performance"
Finding inspiration instead of it finding you,"One approach to innovation and brainstorming is to wait for the muse to appear, to hope that it alights on your shoulder, to be ready to write down whatever comes to you.
The other is to seek it out, will it to appear, train it to arrive on time and on command.
The first method plays into our fears. After all, if you're not inspired, it's not your fault if you don't ship, it's not your fault if you don't do anything remarkable–hey, I don't have any good ideas, you can't expect me to speak up if I don't have any good ideas…
The second method challenges the fear and announces that you've abandoned the resistance and instead prepared to ship. Your first idea might not be good, or even your second or your tenth, but once you dedicate yourself to this cycle, yes, in fact, you will ship and make a difference.
Simple example: start a blog and post once a day on how your favorite company can improve its products or its service. Do it every day for a month, one new, actionable idea each and every day. Within a few weeks, you'll notice the change in the way you find, process and ship ideas.","August 20, 2010","Inspiration, Innovation, Action"
Splitting wood,"When using an axe to split logs, it's awfully tempting to aim at the top of the log.
After all, if you miss the log entirely, it's dangerous or at the very least, ineffective. One can argue that if you don't split the top, it's pointless—nothing else will happen.
The problem with aiming at the top is that the axe loses momentum before its work is done and you end up with a stuck axe and half a split log.
No, the best approach is to focus on splitting thebottomof the log. Split the bottom and the top takes care of itself.
Amplification: some of my smartest and fastest-reading readers (and some with experience in log splitting) missed the point of the post above. I'm not Gary Larson, so I guess I should clarify.
I'm not talking about turning the log upside down or some other semantic trick. I'm pointing out that if you aim at the top (at getting started), then you don't split the wood. If you aim at the bottom (by way of the top) then you do. Hitting the top of the log isn't, the point, it's merely the beginning of the stroke. In other words, don't focus so much on starting something. It's the follow through that will get you there, so the beginning must be with the end in mind. And yes, this actually makes wood chopping far easier.","August 19, 2010","wood splitting, axe technique, follow through"
"Subtlety, deconstructed","Subtle is a cousin of beautiful.
Subtle design and messaging challenge the user to make her own connections instead of spelling out every detail. Connections we make are more powerful than connections made for us. If Amazon and Zappos had been called ""reallybigbookstore.com"" and ""tonsofshoes.com"" it might have made some early investors happy, but they would have built little of value.
Subtle details demonstrate power. Instead of being in an urgent hurry to yell about every feature or benefit, you demonstrate confidence by taking your time and allowing people to explore. They don't put huge banners on the Hermes store, announcing how good the silk is and how many famous people shop there…
And subtle messaging communicates insider status. I don't have to say, ""Hey I was in Skull and Bones too! You should hire me!"" Instead, a subtle (secret) handshake does all the talking that's needed.
It's tempting to turn the dial all the way to 11, the make everything just a bit louder. The opposite is precisely what you might need.
I'm aware of the oxymoronic nature of spelling out details about subtlety. At least I didn't explicitly point out the Spinal Tap reference.","August 18, 2010","Subtlety, Design, Communication"

Avoiding momentum,"Some days, even the best dentist doesn't feel like being a dentist.
And a lifeguard might not feel like being a lifeguard.
Fortunately, they have appointments, commitments and jobs. They have to show up. They have to start doing the work. And most of the time, this jump start is sufficient to get them over the hump, and then they go back to being in the zone and doing their best work.
Momentum is incredibly useful to someone who has to overcome fear, dig in deep and ship. Momentum gives you a reason to overcome your fear and do your art, because there are outside forces and obligations that keep you moving. Without them, you'd probably stumble and fall.
And yet…
And yet many of us fear too much momentum. We look at a project launch or a job or another new commitment as something that might get out of control. It's one thing to be a folk singer playing to a hundred people a night in a coffeehouse, but what if the momentum builds and you become a star? A rock star? With an entourage and appearances and higher than high expectations for your next work. That's a lot of momentum, no?
Deep down, this potential for an overwhelming response alerts the lizard brain and we hold back. We're afraid of being part of something that feels like it might be too big for us.
Hint: it probably isn't.",,"momentum, fear, commitment"
The fear tax,"Here's what happens as a result of security theater at the Orlando airport:
Here's what doesn't happen:
In other words, we're paying a significant tax (time and money) and getting nothing in return. In fact, we get worse than nothing. We could call it an anxiety program, instead of a tax. (After all, when you pay a luxury tax, you get some hard-won luxury as part of the deal).
The reason the TSA keeps changing the rules is not because the rules work, but because changing the rules creates more anxiety (for bad guys, they say, but for us too).
Another example: the MBA. A lot of entrepreneurs get an MBA because they are afraid to go out into world without one. They are seeking the reassurance a credential will bring them, even though the cost is huge and there's no data to indicate that they'll be more successful as an entrepreneur as a result.
We pay the fear tax every time we spend time or money seeking reassurance. We pay it twice when the act of seeking that reassurance actually makes us more anxious, not less.
We pay the tax when we cover our butt instead of doing the right thing, and we pay the tax when we take away someone's dignity because we're afraid.
We should quantify the tax. The government should publish how much ofour money they're spending to create fear and then spending to (apparently) address fear.Corporations should add to their annual reports how much they spentjust-in-case. Once we know how much it costs, we can figure out if it'sworth it.
Instead of seeking out gatekeepers and critics and others that demand we get the broom of the wicked witch, perhaps we should just publish our work. The tax is too high.
Instead of forgetting about the wasted anxiety after the fact, perhaps we ought to keep a log of how often we needlessly pay the fear tax.
Instead of over-staffing, over-planning, over-meeting and over-analyzing, perhaps organizations should take lower-cost steps and actually ship.
Think about how much you could get done if you didn't have to pay a tax to amplify or mollify your fear…","August 16, 2010","Fear tax, security theater, anxiety"
How long before you run out of talking points?,"Here's how you know if someone is living the brand, is emotionally connected to the story and is literate and informed–or if they're just emotionally connected in the moment:

Then compare these passionate leaders to a pundit, spin doctor or troll (for just about any cause du jour) being interviewed on TV. After three sentences, they run out of assertions, facts or interesting things to say.

How big is your red zone?,"Every activity worth doing has a learning curve. Riding a bike, learning to read, using Facebook… the early days are rarely nothing but fun.
Take a look at this three part chart. The first shows how much joy someone gets out of an activity. Over time, as we discover new things and get better at it, our satisfaction increases. At some point, there's a bump when we get quite good at it, and then, in most activities, it fades because we get bored. (In the top graph I've also added the Dip, showing the extra joy from being an expert, but that's irrelevant to this discussion).
The second graph shows the hassle of that same activity. Riding a bike, for example, is horrible at first. Skinned knees, bruised egos. Twitter is really easy to use the first few times, so not so much red ink there.
The third graph is just the two overlaid. That zone on the left, the red zone, is the gap between the initial hassle and the initial joy.My contention is that the only reason we ever get through that gap is that someone on the other side (the little green circle) is rooting us on, or telling us stories of how great it is on the other side.
The bigger your red zone, the louder your green dot needs to be. Every successful product or passion is either easy to get started on or comes with a built-in motivator to keep you moving until you're in. This is so easy to overlook, because of course you're already in…","August 15, 2010","red zone, learning curve, motivation"
The right price the first time,"The way you price expensive transactions is going to train your partners and customers in how to behave.
When selling a book to a major publisher, it’s common for the publisher to offer an advance against royalties. In fact, the advance is the most significant tool that publishers use to get a coveted author to pick one house over another–royalties and most everything else are fixed.
It turns out that if an agent offers a hot book to multiple publishers at the same time, the advance offered goes up, often dramatically. Obviously, the publisher was capable of offering the higher advance without the auction, but it was the risk of losing the book that got them to pony up more money.
This trains agents and authors to be disloyal, to shop around and to create an artificial game to raise the price.
Or consider the real estate developer who calls up an electrician to re-wire a building. She uses this electrician often, and the estimate comes back at $18,000. The developer shops around and finds a similarly talented electrician for $14,000. Loyalty is great, but that’s a huge difference. She switches to the higher value choice. Indignant, the original electrician says, “why didn’t you tell me! I could have beaten that price.”
The answer, of course, is, “well, why didn’t you quote me that price in the first place?”
You might leave money on the table if you reward people for being loyal (and don’t make them shop around each time). I think it’s money well spent, because loyalty is worth more than a little more margin. If you train your partners to shop around, expect them to shop around.","August 14, 2010","Pricing strategy, loyalty, competition"
Resilience and the incredible power of slow change,"Most existing systems (organizations, cities, careers, governments) are resilient to external shocks. If they weren't, they wouldn't still be here. Earthquakes, edicts and emergencies come and they go, but the systems remain.
And yet, it's the emergencies we pay attention to.
No single event demolished the music business. It was a series of slow changes over the course of two decades, all the way back to the CD.
Smoking killed far more people than terrorists ever did. It's just not as dramatic.
No single technology destroyed the business model for newspapers. Sure, Craigslist hastened their demise, but the writing has been on the wall for a decade or more.
Your career won't be made or broken on the back of one interview, one meeting, one sales call. Sure, it might help (or hurt), but the sudden impact of one event isn't sufficient to change everything forever.
The slow changes in the media landscape are accelerating and virtually every pre-digital system is in danger. The slow changes in the marketing landscape are in their second decade and these changes will have their effects on every business and cause as well.
Cultural shifts create long terms evolutionary changes. Cultural shifts, changes in habits, technologies that slowly obsolete a product or a system are the ones that change our lives. Watch for shifts in systems and processes and expectations. That's what makes change, not big events.
Don't worry about what happened yesterday (or five minutes ago). Focus on what happened ten years ago and think about what you can do that will make a huge impact in six months. The breaking news mindset isn't just annoying, it may be distracting you from what really matters. As the world gets faster, it turns out that the glacial changes of years and decades are become more important, not less.","August 13, 2010","Resilience, Slow Change, Cultural Shifts"
Foundation elements for modern businesses,"When you sit down to dream up a new business, you can imagine a world without constraints. Or you can choose to build in fundamental pieces that will make it more likely your idea will pay off.
Here are some fundamental pieces of most new successful businesses. The goal is to build these elements into the very nature of the business itself, not just to tack them on. For example, the Scotch tape people at 3M can't do #5, because of the structure of retail distribution and the way they mass produce and can't track who is buying what.
You can live without some of these, but go in with your eyes open if you do:
Notes:
3. The cost of selling a subscription to your product or service is not a lot higher than the cost of selling just one, but you benefit by having sales you can count on at low cost. Your customers benefit because you depend on them more and they save time.
5. Everyone has different needs and expectations and resources. The internet lets you tell people apart and give them what they need.
7. AKA as Linchpins.
9. If you're building a business on trade secrets or lack of information among your customers, you're trying to fill a leaky bucket. Far easier to bet on the more people know, the better you do.
10. Because cheap software and the cloud are going to continue to get cheaper, and custom work that's worth anything is going to continue to get more expensive.

When technology and tradition diverge,"What be the effect on voting patterns if we used digital technology to announce the current vote tally every hour (or every hundred votes).
People would see the direction an election was going and be more likely to be pulled in. Voter attention and ultimately voter involvement would go up, and fraud would be more difficult. [I'm well aware this is a fairly lame variation, there's actually a million interestingalternatives, I just picked a simple one.]
So why don't we do it?
When the secret ballot was introduced, it just wasn't possible to count the votes in less than a few days. So a tradition was established, driven by the technology, not because it was the best way. Now, of course, the technology doesn't need that tradition any longer, but it's still here.
One by one, traditions that supported technology are falling as the technology changes. The simple thank you note, for example, is a long tradition based on the technology of couriers and then the postal service. Of course it arrives three days later, because that's how long it takes. At first, the email thank you note seems too impersonal, too easy, too digital. Then, we begin to appreciate the speed and it become ubiquitous and then expected.
There are huge opportunities for marketers seeking to upend traditions that have outlived their usefulness. Just don't expect it to happen overnight.","August 11, 2010","technology, tradition, voting"
The places you go,"Over the weekend I visited one of my favorite places. It didn't matter that I hadn't been there in a while, or didn't know most of the people I encountered. The second I walked in, heard the noise, saw the walls… even the way it smelled… I was transported.
It’s incredible to think about–a room could magically change the way I felt. A physical room with the right memories can do this in just a heartbeat. So can a metaphorical one, even a brand.
The states of your emotions (your moods and passions) are like rooms in a house.
Anxiety, flow, joy, fear, exhaustion, connection, contemplation, emotional labor… each one can be visited at will if we choose. Sometimes by entering a real room, but more often in metaphor…
Do you have a friend you can have an intimate, tearful conversation with anytime you pick up the phone? Is there a topic that if you bring it up with your boss, it will quickly lead to contention? Is there a place or a memory that never fails to bring melancholy along with it?
Occasionally we encounter emotions at random. More often, we have no choice, because there’s something that needs to be done, or an event that impinges itself on us. But most often, we seek emotions out, find refuge in them, just as we walk into the living room or the den.
Stop for a second and reread that sentence, because it’s certainly controversial. I’m arguing that more often than not, we encounter fear or aggravation or delight because we seek it out, not because it’s thrust on us.
Why check your email every twenty minutes? It’s not because it needs checking. It’s because the checking puts us into a state we seek out. Why yell at the parking attendant with such gusto? Teaching him a lesson isn’t the point–no, in that moment, it’s what we want to do, it’s a room we choose to hang out in. It could be something as prosaic as getting involved in a flame war online every day, or checking your feeds at midnight or taking a shot or two before dinner. It’s not something you have to do, it’s something you choose to do, because going there takes your emotions to a place you’ve gotten used to, a place where you feel comfortable, even if it makes you unhappy.
There’s a metaphorical room I can go to where I’m likely to experience flow–a sense of being in the moment and getting an enormous amount done. Down the hall is the room where there’s a lot of anxiety about something I can’t change. I can visit that room if I choose, but I don’t. And yes, it’s a choice.
Great brands figure out how to supply a ‘room’ to anyone who chooses to visit. Soap opera fans, for example, can count on being put into a certain state anytime they tune in. The Apple store is carefully calibrated as an architectural and retail room that will change how you feel when you enter it. Chiat Day built offices in New York and LA that triggered huge waves of creativity. And there's nothing like the face of a kid eating a Hershey's bar…
YouTube isn't just video. It's a room. Not everyone uses it the same way, but most people use it the same way every time they use it. If it's the site people go to see stupid pet tricks and write stupider comments, then they know why they're going and it's going to be hard for it to become something else…
Is your brand providing the right room to the right people at the right time? Most products, most services–they provide a thing, a list of features, but not a room for my emotions.
This insight about our moods and your brand is all well and good, but it becomes essential once you realize that there are some rooms you’re spending way too much time in, that these choices are taking away from your productivity or your happiness.
Why are you going there again?
Every time you go to that room, you get unhappy, and so do we. Every time you go that room, you spend more time than you expected, and it stresses out the rest of your day. Every time you go to that room you short-circuit the gifts you give to the rest of the team.
Once your habit becomes an addiction, it’s time to question why you get up from a room that was productive and happy, a place you were engaged, and walk down the hall to a room that does no one any good (least of all, you). Tracking your day and your emotions is a first step, but it takes more than that. It takes the guts to break some ingrained habits, ones that the people around you might even be depending on.","August 10, 2010","emotions, metaphor, choice"
Competition,"The number one reason people give me for giving up on something great is, ""someone else is already doing that.""
Or, parsed another way, ""my idea is not brand new."" Or even, ""Oh no, now we'll have competition.""
Two big pieces of news for you:
1. Competition validates you. It creates a category. It permits the sale to be this or that, not yes or no. And this or that is a much easier sale to make. It also makes decisions about pricing easier, because you have someone to compare against and lean on.
2. There are six billion people in the world. Even if your market is hand-made spoke shaves for left-handed woodworkers, there are more people in your market than you can ever hope to track down.

Ever have a day when none of the things you need to focus on materialize, when the emotional labor doesn't come naturally?
Most of us have come up with a strategy for days we're working funny–we do the busy work, we reply, react and occasionally respond. We show up at the meetings and we answer our email, and we go home feeling as though we accomplished at least a little something (though we didn't.)
The danger is this: this working funny habit leaks into the days when we're on our game. When you're on a roll, you still find yourself going to meetings, answering email and working through someone else's to-do list. That's a waste.

Accept all substitutes,"Commerce is about pricing, and pricing is about scarcity. Scarcity, of course, demands no easy substitutes.
Some news websites are foolishly putting up paywalls, requiring readers to pay by the day or the year to see what's there. This is foolish because substitutes are so easy to find. If I can't get to the Times of London or Time magazine, no problem, I'll find the same news (or almost the same news) somewhere else.
This is the mistake that book publishers are making on the Kindle. I was mildly interested in the new biography of Henry Luce. But it's $19 on the Kindle. That's outrageous in a world where there are plenty (more than I can ever read) of great biographies for less than $10 on this very same device. (In fact, I can buy thebiographyof his forgotten partner, the actual founder of Time, for $4 in paperback or $10 on the kindle.) Is a biography about someone else a perfect substitute? Not if you're writing your dissertation about Luce, no, it's not. But the publishers seek a broader audience than that, don't they?

B is for Bootstrapper:A bootstrapper is someone who starts a business with no money andfunds growth through growth. The internet has made bootstrapping much easier than ever, because the costs of creating and marketing remarkable things are cheaper than ever. It's really important not to act like you're well-funded if you're intent on bootstrapping (and vice versa). You can read theBootstrapper's Biblefor free.
C is for Choice: I didn't coin the term theLong Tail, but I wish I had. It describes a simple law: given the choice, people will take the choice. That means that digital commerce enables niches. Aggregating and enabling the long tail accounts for the success of eBay, iTunes, Amazon, Craigslist, Google and even match.com.
D is for Darwin:Things evolve. But evolution is speeding up (and yes, evolving). While it used to take a hundred thousand years for significant changes to happen to our physical culture, the nature of information and a connected society means that 'everything' might change in just a few months. Ideas that spread, win and organizations that learn from their mistakes lead the rest of us. (fromSurvival is Not Enough)
E is for Edgecraft:Brainstorming doesn't work so well, because most people are bad at it. They're bad at it because their lizard brain takes over moments before a big idea is uttered. ""Oh no!"" it says, ""I better not say that because if I do, then I'll have to do it."" And so brainstorming quickly becomes clever stalling and timewasting. Far better is to practice edgegraft. Someone announces a direction (""we'll be really convenient, we'll offer our menu by fax,"") and then the next person goes closer to that edge, topping it, (""we'll offer it by email!"") and so on, each topping the other in any particular direction. (from the bookFree Prize Inside)
F is for the Free Prize:People often don't buy the obvious or measured solution to their problem, they buy the extra, the bonus, the feeling and the story. The free prize is the layout of Google–the search results are the same, but the way the search feels is why you choose to search there. If engineers thought more about the free prize, we'd need fewer marketers.
G is for Go go go™:I just trademarked this one, but you have my permission to use it all you like. Go go go is the mantra of someone who has committed to defeating their anxiety and ignoring their lizard brain. Not a good strategy for airline pilots, but for the rest of us, a little Go go go might be just the ticket.
H is for broken:Isn't it just like a marketer to compromise when he should have organized better in the first place? There's a lot in our consumer society that'sbroken, but try to avoid getting obsessed with it. Far better to ship your own stuff that's not broken instead.
I is for Ideavirus:A decade ago a wrote a book that was free.It still is.It argues that ideas that spread win, and you can architect and arrange and manipulate your ideas to make them more likely to spread. Note that I'm not saying you can add gimmicks and spam and networking to spread your idea. I'm saying the idea itself is more or less likely to spread based on how you design it.
J is for just looking:When there's plenty of choice and everything is a click away, I'm very unlikely to take action, certainly unlikely to actually buy something from you. I'll do it tomorrow. Or the day after. Which means the only way you create action is to produce an emergency. Why now? Why not later…
K is for kindle:No, not the ebook reader. Kindle as in patiently starting a fire. The TV era demanded blockbuster launches of blockbuster products aimed at the masses. The internet responds better to bonfires that are kindled over time, to ideas that spread because the idea itself is the engine, not the hype or the promotion.First, ten.
L is for Lizard Brain:This is a huge impediment to getting what you want, finding your calling and satisfying your customers. Thelizard brainis near your brain stem, including your amygdala. It's the part of your brain responsible for anger, revenge, fear, anxiety and reproduction. It's the original brain, the one that wild animals possess. Steve Pressfield has named the voice of the lizard: it's the resistance. The resistance rationalizes, hides and sabotages your best work.
M is for Meatball Sundae:This is the unfortunate combination of traditional products and services (designed for low price and good quality) with the high-growth nature of the idea-driven internet. When your boss tells you to build a viral campaign about some lame product gathering dust in the warehouse, she's asking you to build ameatball sundaeand you should flee.
N is for NOBS: Otherwise known as the new order business school. Myrantabout this points out that for most people, a traditional MBA is a waste of both time and money. The two biggest benefits–the selection process of getting in, and the social process of networking–could be accomplished, in a Swiftian fashion, without any classes at all.
O is for Orangutan:I could have used the word 'monkey', but I already had an M listing, plus I love the way you spell Orangutan. Anyway, the primate is the best way to think about how people interact with websites. They're like monkeys in a psychology experiment, looking for thebanana. Where's the banana, they ask? Of course, I don't know the monkey word for banana, so I'm paraphrasing. If your website offers a banana, people are going to click on it. If they don't, they'll leave. My argument for banana design is inThe Big Red Fez.
P is for Permission:Anticipated, personal and relevant messages will always outperform spam. Obvious, but true. So then why do you persist in spamming people? Billboards, TV ads, phone calls–they all are defeated soundly by delivering your offers with permission. In fact, the biggest asset a company can build online is this privilege, the list of people who would miss you if you didn't show up. Here's theoriginal interview(12 years ago!) inFast Company.
Q is for Quitting:Sticking things out is overrated, particularly if you stick out the wrong things. In fact, I think you'd be much better off quitting most of what you do so you have the resources to get through the hard slog I callthe Dip… The challenge, then is to not quit in the Dip, but instead to quit everything else so you have the focus to get through the slog of what matters.
R is for Remarkable:Apurple cowis remarkable, because it's worth talking about. Not because you, the marketer said it was, but because I the consumer did. And in a world without effective, scalable advertising, remarkable products and services are the single best way to succeed. Here's along essayfrom seven years ago.
S is for Sneezer:What do we call someone who spreads an idea the way some people spread a virus? Seek them out, cater to them, organize them.
T is for Tribe:Human beings evolved to be attracted to tribes. Groups of like-minded people who share a culture, a connection and perhaps a goal. And each of these tribes seeks leadership. The opportunity for marketers today isn't to sell more average stuff to more average people. The opportunity is to find and connect and leadtribesof people, taking them somewhere they want to go.
U is for Ululate:Not because it's relevant, just because it's the single best word in the English language. Can I sneak an extra C? Thecliff business.
V is for Very good:No one cares about very good. I can get very good from just about anyone, and certainly cheaper than I can get it from you. We don't have a competence shortage, not any more. No, I'm only going to pay extra for the personal, the magical, the artistic and the work of thelinchpin.
W is for Worldview:I first encountered this term via George Lakoff. Yourworldviewis the set of expectations and biases you bring to a situation before any new data appears. Some people hear a politician say something and hate it, while others are thrilled by it. Is it the thing that was said or the person who said it? Some people hear that Apple is about to launch a new product and they get out their wallets, others flee–before they even know what it is. If you don't understand the worldview of the people you're selling to, youwillfail.
X is for Xebec:I hate it when A-to-Z listmakers cheap out on the X. Hey, a xebec is a three-masted schooner. And they're obsolete. Just like CDs, newspapers and a whole host of interesting but dated business models. Sorry. Imagine someone saying: ""He's a nice guy, but that company he works for is a xebec.""
Y is for You.You the artist. You the one who makes a difference. You the one who stands for something and now has the leverage (and access to the market) to actually ship. Go go go.™
Z is for Zoometry:Originally a term from zoology (pronounced zo-ology, in case you were curious), zoometry is the science of instigating and learning from change. This is the revolution of our time, the biggest one in history, and it's not just about silly videos on Youtube. One by one, industry by industry, the world is being remade again and again, and the agents of change are the winners.","August 2, 2010","Neologisms, Innovation, Marketing"
Intolerance and xenophobia as a (short-term) marketing strategy,"Possibly the oldest human worldview is fear of strangers. And right next to that is anger as a byproduct of fear.
If a candidate wants to gain attention and possibly votes, then, it makes short-term sense to stir up fear of strangers and turn it into anger. It might even work (once). But it makes it virtually impossible to govern. It's a short-term strategy that eats itself, because sooner or later, everyone is a stranger, and fear is no foundation for work that matters.
It seems as though we're entering a season in which it's easy to ostracize or become righteously indignant over someone's national origin, skin color, religion or sexual orientation.
If this is the best a politician can do to organize and lead, then we all lose.","August 1, 2010","Intolerance, xenophobia, marketing strategy"

Getting better at seeing,"A giant pitfall in the way small companies and individuals market themselves, particularly online or in presentations, is that they're often cheesy, ugly or unreadable.
I don't think people deliberately set out to be ugly, but they end up that way. And a quick look at your own buying behavior should tell you that you don't often buy from the sketchy-looking sites, ads and media that are often pitched at you.
No, I think the problem is that people don't realize that their work is ugly. They don't see it. Just like the close-talker down the hall from your cube doesn't realize that he's a close-talker. I'm not talking about skill or talent or even guts. I'm talking about learning to see what others see.
John McWadetaught me how to see. I'm not great at it, I'm certainly guilty of designing my own not-so-ideal materials. But the gap between the one-eyed man and the blind is pretty big.
It might take a few weeks of hard work to start to notice what looks right in the world (and why). I think it's worth it.

Needs don’t always lead to demand,"One of the accepted holy grails of building an organization is that you should fill a need. Fill people's needs, they say, and the rest will take care of itself.
But… someone might know that they need to lose some weight, but what they demand is potato chips.
Someone might know that they need to be more concerned about the world, but what they demand is another fake reality show.
As my friend Tricia taught me, this is brought into sharp relief when doing social enterprise in the developing world. There are things that people vitally need… and yet providing it is no guarantee you'll find demand.
Please don't get confused by what the market needs. That's something you decided, not them.
If you want to help people lose weight, you need to sell them something they demand, like belonging or convenience, not lecture them about what they need.","September 29, 2010","demand, needs, social enterprise"
Accounting for taste,"Taste is the ability to select, combine and create experiences that the tribe likes–before they know that they like it.
John Waters, the filmmaker many accuse of having bad taste actually has great taste–according to a small tribe of people. He establishes a look and a feel and a story that (for this group) is then emulated.
Successful chefs like Thomas Keller invent restaurants and the dishes they offer–and are then rewarded for having the good taste to make precisely what we like. But of course, the 'we' isn't everyone.
Martha Stewart, according to a larger group, also has good taste. She's not merely copying what came before (that's not nearly as difficult or as valuable)… no, she's staying half a step ahead of her tribe, establishing the standard as she goes.
Great graphic designers have good taste. They understand how to use type and imagery to create objects and advertising that resonate with people likely to buy. Copying a book cover or a business card or a mayo label isn't good taste, it's copying. The difficult work is doing a new thing in a way that people who have never seen it before will 'get it'.
The other difficult work: understanding thatyourstandards might not be the standards of the tribe you're seeking to connect with. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's in bad taste. If the market respects the creator, takes action and then adopts the work, it's in good taste.","September 28, 2010","taste, creativity, design"
Five rules for your About page,"When someone comes to your site for the first time, they're likely to hit 'about' or 'bio'. Why? Because they want a human, a story and reassurance.
Here are some helpful guidelines (okay, they're actually imperatives):
1. Don't use meaningless jargon:
… is a recognized provider of result-based online and mobile advertising solutions. Dedicated to complete value chain optimization and maximization of ROI for its clients, … is committed to the ongoing mastery of the latest online platforms – and to providing continuously enhanced aggregation and optimization options.
2. Don't use a stock photo of someone who isn't you (if there is a stock photo of you, congratulations). The more photos of you and your team, the better.
3. Make it easy to contact you. Don't give a contact address or number that doesn't work.
4. Be human. Write like you talk and put your name on it. Tell a story, a true one, one that resonates.
5. Use third party comments and testimonials to establish credibility. Use a lot of them. Make sure they're both interesting and true.","September 27, 2010","About page, authenticity, credibility"
The problem with putting it all on the line…,"is that it might not work out.
The problem with not putting it all on the line is that it will never (ever) change things for the better.

The market is not seduced by logic,"People are moved by stories and drama and hints and clues and discovery.

Cost reduction for high-end markets,"If you sell at the top of the market (luxury travel, services to Fortune 500 companies, financial services for the wealthy…) you might be tempted to figure out ways to cut costs and become more efficient.
After all, if you save a dollar, you make a dollar, without even getting a new customer.
Resist.
The goal shouldn't be to reduce costs. It should be to increase them.
That voice mail service that saves you $30,000 a year in receptionist costs–it also makes you much more similar to a competitor that is more efficiently serving the middle of the market.
Go through all the ways you serve your customers and make themmoreexpensive to execute, not less. Your loyalty and your market share will both grow. People who can afford to pay for service often choose to pay for service.","September 24, 2010","Cost reduction, luxury market, customer service"
The Mesh is here (don’t miss it),"My friend Lisa Gansky has a new book out today. You can read a bit about ithere.
I hope you'll buy a copy right now. It's that important and that valuable.
Gansky has written the most insightful book about new economy business models sinceThe Long Tail, and if you're not facile in understanding and working with the key concept behind this book, it's going to cost you time and trouble.
In short,theMeshoutlines how sharing resources and information creates an entirely new class of commerce. When you travel to another city, you don't buy a house. You stay in a hotel. A hotel, because it allows hundreds of people a year to share a single room, is a mesh business.
The thing is, the web has created thousands (probably more) of these businesses in areas you have never thought about. Zipcar, sure, and Netflix. But in all sorts of nooks and crannies as well. Lisa's online directory already lists thousands of these companies. Existing companies need to know about this, job seekers should be attracted to it, and for entrepreneurs, it really is a new frontier.

“I need you to see things my way”,"And that's the frustration of the marketer or the artist who hasn't figured out how to navigate critics and the marketplace.
If you need the validation and acceptance and patronage of everyone you meet, you'll get stuck, and soon. Everyone isn't going to get it. Everyone isn't even going to getyou,never mind what you sell.
Experienced marketers and artists and those that make change understand that the new is not for everyone. In fact, it's not even for most people. Pass them by. They can catch up later.
It's not a referendum, and you don't need a unanimous vote of acclamation. No, you merely need enough to stay in business, to keep moving, to make a dent. And then your idea can spread.
If the kids in the back of the bus/audience/store don't get it (or don't get you) it's their loss. Focus on those that want to celebrate the work you do instead.",,"validation, critics, audience"
Dissatisfaction guaranteed,"Great brands are built on dissatisfaction. After all, if you are satisfied with your Revlon makeup or your Nike sneakers or your iPad, why would you buy another one? Satisfied means done, finished, I don't need any more.
In fact, most great commercial (and non-profit, and political) brands create a cycle of purchase based on ever-greater dissatisfaction with what we've got.","September 22, 2010","Dissatisfaction, Branding, Consumer Cycle"
Do you actually care about privacy?,"I'm not sure you do.
If you cared about privacy you wouldn't have a credit card, because, after all, they know everything you spend money on. And you wouldn't use the phone, because somewhere, there's a computer scanning what you say.
What most of us care about is being surprised. You don't want the credit card company to track where you're staying and whether you're buying flowers for someone you're not even married to–and then send you a free coupon for STD testing, right? Even if it was a good coupon, and even if they knew you needed it. No, you don't want this because you don't want to be surprised.
What many people miss about privacy and Facebook is that the company has always taken the position that privacy shouldn't be assumed. Sure, they've mishandled some of their user communications and feature rollouts, but basically, they offer the religion of no-privacy, and an entire generation or two is ready to grow up in public as a result. We're just not eager to be surprised along the way.","September 21, 2010","privacy, surveillance, consumer behavior"
The forever recession,"There are two recessions going on.
One is gradually ending. This is the cyclical recession, we have them all the time, they come and they go. Not fun, but not permanent.
The other one, I fear, is here forever. This is the recession of the industrial age, the receding wave of bounty that workers and businesses got as a result of rising productivity but imperfect market communication.
In short: if you're local, we need to buy from you. If you work in town, we need to hire you. If you can do a craft, we can't replace you with a machine.
No longer.
The lowest price for any good worth pricing is now available to anyone, anywhere. Which makes the market for boring stuff a lot more perfect than it used to be.
Since the 'factory' work we did is now being mechanized, outsourced or eliminated, it's hard to pay extra for it. And since buyers have so many choices (and much more perfect information about pricing and availability) it's hard to charge extra.
Thus, middle class jobs that existed because companies had no choice are now gone.
Protectionism isn't going to fix this problem. Neither is stimulus of old factories or yelling in frustration and anger. No, the only useful response is to view this as an opportunity. To poorly paraphrase Clay Shirky, every revolution destroys the last thing before it turns a profit on a new thing.
The networked revolution is creating huge profits, significant opportunities and a lot of change. What it's not doing is providing millions of brain-dead, corner office, follow-the-manual middle class jobs. And it's not going to.
Fast, smart and flexible are embraced by the network. Linchpin behavior. People and companies we can't live without (because if I can live without you, I'm sure going to try if the alternative is to save money).
The sad irony is that everything we do to prop up the last economy (more obedience, more compliance, cheaper yet average) gets in the way of profiting from this one.",,"recession, middle class, networked revolution"
Questions or answers,"You can add value in two ways:
Relentlessly asking the right questions is a long term career, mostly because no one ever knows the right answer on a regular basis.","September 20, 2010","Questions, Value, Career"
Are you responsible for what you market?,"Let's assert that marketing works.
The money and time and effort we put into marketing goods and services actually works. It gets people to change their minds. It cajoles some people into buying and using and voting for things that they otherwise wouldn't have chosen. (If it doesn't work, save your money).
If it works, then, are you responsible for what happens after that?
If you market cigarettes aggressively, are you responsible for people dying of lung cancer?
I think there are two ways to go here:
1. You're not responsible. The marketer is like a lawyer representing the obviously guilty client. Everyone is entitled to a lawyer, and it's up to the jury to decide. The lawyer's job is to do the best she can, not to decide on the outcome. Market the best you can and let buyers take responsibility.
2. You are responsible. Your insight and effort cause people to change, and without you, that change would never happen.
I'm not sure there's a middle ground. Either we should applaud the folks lobbying on behalf of causes we despise, the pornographers selling products that degrade our society and the politicians spinning and lying to get elected (because all these people are doing is giving us a choice for which we're responsible) or we should take responsibility for stuff we sell.

The power of buttons and being normal,"Taxi drivers in New York were worried about adding credit cards to their cabs. The fee (5% or so) would cost them too much, they said.
It turns out that tips are up, way up. They're actually making far more money now.
Why? Because most of the machines offer a shortcut for the tip: $2, $3 or $4.
You can decide to be a cheapskate and hit the $2 button. Except…
Except that if you had paid cash, you probably would have tipped 75 cents for that $4.25 ride. It takes a few more clicks to type in 75 cents, and hey, $2 is the lowest and it's a more 'normal' amount.

So easy to be right when everyone else is wrong, so easy to be confident when someone else is putting themselves on the line.
I start with this: do we agree that there's a problem? An opportunity?
Do we agree that we need to take action, that something needs to be done, that there's an opportunity here?
If we don't agree on that, then don't waste time listening to my solution. Before we do that, let's spend more time deciding if there's a problem or opportunity here.

Beyond crowdsourcing,"Crowd accelerated innovationis the latest TED talk. It's from TED boss Chris Anderson.
The idea is one of those big ones, a simple one that will stick with you for a long time… Online video radically changes the reach and speed of the improvement cycle. Things like dance, snowboarding and TED talks keep getting better, and faster, because artists see the best and improve on it. Even more than that, it requires you to top what's out there, or you'll be ignored.
The same thing has been done with scientific journals for two hundred years. Now, though, instead of a long cycle and a few readers, we have a nearly instant cycle and millions of 'readers'. Video scales, now. And to quote the other Chris Anderson, there's going to be a long tail of these video cycles.
Also worth thinking on: Chris is using the medium itself to do something that would have required a traditionally published book five years ago.

Rehearsing is for cowards,"Jackson Browne gave us that advice. He would rather have you explore.
Exploring helps you figure out what you can do the next time you present or perform or interact. Rehearsing, on the hand, means figuring out exactly what you're going to do so you can protect against the downside, the unpredictable and the embarrassing.
I'm not dismissing study, learning, experimenting or getting great at what you do. In fact, I'm arguing in favor of this sort of hard work. No, I'm talking about the repetition of doing itbeforeyou do it, again and again. Just drilling it in so you can regurgitate later. Better, I think,as they say, ""…let's do it live.""

What shape is your funnel?,"Put random folks in at the top and loyal customers come out at the bottom…
A billboard leads people to a website, which gets some people to subscribe via email which drives some folks to respond to a promotion which leads a few to come back for the stuff that isn't onsale, which leads to someone who can't live without you.
That's the obvious path of outbound marketing. Most people you pour into the funnel hop out long before they become loyal customers.
The thing is, some funnels are more efficient than others. Expose your idea to ten of the right people and it catches on with three of them. Other ideas or offers need to be exposed to far more people (and go through more steps) before they're likely to convert someone.
The mistake we often make: thinking that the problem is that there'snot enough peoplestarting the process, not enough people being exposed to your offer. In fact, it's almost always a problem with how efficient the funnel is and how likely it is that loyal customers tell their friends. If you take care of those two elements, you have a lot more to invest in promotion, and delightfully, the promotion is more effective as well.
Google advertising puts the funnel shape under stress. If you can make your funnel more efficient, then you can afford to spend more money on each person you put into the top of the funnel via a paid ad. If your competitor can convert twice as many people as you can, she can spend twice as much per person, no? And thus the smart competitor will buy up as much of the market as possible. The only response: shape a more efficient funnel.","September 15, 2010","funnel efficiency, outbound marketing, customer conversion"
Self-delusion and self-loathing,"Two shores of the same river, either can get you into a lot of trouble.

The myth of preparation,"There are three stages of preparation. (For a speech, a product, an interview, a sporting event…)
The first I'll call the beginner stage. This is where you make huge progress as a result of incremental effort.
The second is the novice stage. This is the stage in which incremental effort leads to not so much visible increase in quality.
And the third is the expert stage. Here's where races are won, conversations are started and sales are made. A huge amount of effort, off limits to most people, earns you just a tiny bit of quality. But it's enough to get through the Dip and be seen as the obvious winner.
Here's the myth: The novice stage is useful.
If all you're going to do is go through the novice stage before you ship, don't bother. If you're not prepared to put in the grinding work of the expert stage, just do the beginner stuff and stop screwing around. Make it good enough and ship it and move on.

Shipit Workbook back in stock for a while,"Two weeks ago, I told you about a workbook I published. I was amazed and a bit delighted to discover that less than 16 hours after announcing it, the entire warehouse was sold out. (It peaked at #8 on the Amazon list).
I apologize to those of you that weren't able to get a set. And I doubly apologize to my beloved Canadian readers who were shut out for no apparent reason that I've been able to discern.
We've gone back to press for more and I'm pleased to announce that the workbooks arenow available, and there's a special option forCanadians. I can't promise that these will last much longer than the last batch, but I've already ordered some more.
Shipping atoms is difficult, and crossing borders is more difficult still. I'm going to adjust as I go and hope to make the supply more reliable. It's doubly disappointing that you can't order when they run out of stock. We're working on that. If you discover an out of stock, please check back after a week…
I'm investigating new ways to make this more efficient going forward. I apologize again, and thank you for your good humor.","September 12, 2010","Shipit Workbook, back in stock, Canadian readers"
Why jazz is more interesting than bowling,"Bowling is all about one number: the final score. And great bowlers come whisker-close to hitting the perfect score regularly. Not enough dimensions for me to be fascinated by, and few people pay money to attend bowling matches.
Jazz is practiced over a thousand or perhaps a million dimensions. It's non-linear and non-predictable, and most of all, it's never perfect.
And yet…

Pushing the spectrum,"Marketers have long tried to turn happy events into shopping opportunities. Macy's and Gimbels and others pushed us to see Christmas as a chance to buy gifts. Shopping is right next to happiness on the spectrum of emotions, I guess, just as green is next to blue in the rainbow. They did it to Valentine's day and now, of course,  Halloween.
Lately, some marketers would like to push us to move from fear to hatred. It makes it easier for them. We honor and remember the heroes who gave everything, the innocent who were lost, the neighbors who narrowly escaped. A day to hate? I hope we can do better than that.","September 11, 2010","Marketing, Emotions, Consumerism"
Interpreting criticism,"Heartfelt criticism of your idea or your art is usually right (except when it isn't…)
Check out this letter from the publisher of a magazine you've never heard of to the founder of a little magazine calledReaders Digest:
But, personally, I don't see how you will be able to get enough subscribers to support it. It is expensive for its size. It isn't illustrated… I have my doubts about the undertaking as a publishing venture.
Of course, he was right–given his assumptions. And that's theexceptpart.
Criticism of your idea is usually based on assumptions about the world as it is. Jackson Pollock could never have made it as an painter in the world as it was. AndHarry Potterwas rejected by just about everyone because for it to succeed the way kids read would have to change.
The useful element of this sort of criticism isn't that the fact that people embracing the status quo don't like your idea. Of course they don't. The interesting question is:what about the world as it is would have to change for your idea to be important?
In the case ofReaders Digest, the key thing that changed was the makeup of who was reading magazines. Most of the people (and it was a lot of people) who subscribed to the Digest didn't read other magazines. And so comparing to other magazines made no sense, except to say, ""this is so different from other magazines, the only way you're going to succeed is by selling it to millions of people who don't read those magazines."" And Starbucks had no chance if they were going to focus on the sort of person who bought coffee at Dunkin Donuts or a diner, and the iPad couldn't possibly succeed if people were content to use computers the way they were already using them.
Keep that in mind the next time a gatekeeper or successful tastemaker explains why you're going to fail.","September 10, 2010","criticism, innovation, assumptions"
Loyalty,"Loyalty is what we call it when someone refuses a momentarily better option.
If your offering isalwaysbetter, you don't have loyal customers, you have smart ones. Don't brag about how loyal your customers are when you're the cheapest or you have clearly dominated some key element of what the market demands. That's not loyalty. That's something else.
Loyal customers understand that there's almostalwayssomething better out there, but they're not so interested in looking.
Loyalty can be rewarded, but loyalty usually comes from within, from a story we like to tell ourselves. We're loyal to sports teams and products (and yes, to people) because being loyal makes us happy. Why else be a fan of the Cubs? Some customers like being loyal. Those are good customers to have.
Loyalty isn't forever. Sometimes, the world changes significantly and even though the loyal partner/customer likes that label, it gets so difficult to stick that he switches.
I think there's no doubt that some brands and teams and politicians and yes, people, attract a greater percentage of loyal fans than others. Not because they're bigger or better, but because they reinforce the good feeling some people get when they're being loyal. Hint: low price or supermodel good looks are not the tools of choice for attracting people who enjoy being loyal.
Rewarding loyalty for loyalty's sake–not by paying people for sticking it out so the offering ends up being more attractive–is not an obvious path, but it's a worthwhile one. Tell a story that appeals to loyalists. Treat different customers differently, and reserve your highest level of respect for those that stand by you.","September 9, 2010","Loyalty, Customer Engagement, Brand Loyalty"

Marketing to the bottom of the pyramid,"[this short essay (long blog post) is inspired by and related to thisvideo. You can engage one without the other, but they go together.]
Part 1: The bottom is important.
Almost a third of the world's population earns $2.50 or less a day. The enormity of this disparity takes my breath away, but there's an interesting flip side to it: That's a market of more than five billion dollarsa day.Add the next segment ($5 a day) and it's easy to see that every single day, the poorest people in the world spend more than ten billion dollars to live their lives.
Most of that money is spent on traditional items purchased in traditional ways. Kerosene. Rice. Basic medicines if you can afford them or if death is the only alternative. And almost all of these purchases are inefficient. There's lack of information, high costs because of a lack of choice, and most of all, a lack of innovation.
There are two significant impacts here: first, the inefficiency is a tax on the people who can least afford it. Second, the side effects of poor products are dangerous. Kerosene kills, and so does dirty water.
Part 2: The bottom is an opportunity (for both buyer or seller).
If a business can offer a better product, one that's more efficient, provides better information, increases productivity, is safer, cleaner, faster or otherwise improved, it has the ability to change the world.
Change the world? Sure. Because capitalism and markets scale. If you can make money selling someone a safer item, you'll make more. And more. Until you've sold all you can. At the same time, you've enriched the purchaser, who bought something of her own free will because it made things better.
Not only that, but engaging in the marketplace empowers the purchaser. If you've got a wagon full of rice as food aid, you can just dump it in the town square and drive away. You have all the power. But if you have to sell something in order to succeed, it moves the power from the seller to buyer. Quality and service and engagement have to continually improve or the buyer moves on.
The cell phone, for example, has revolutionized the life of billions in the developing world. If you have a cell phone, you can determine the best price for the wheat you want to sell. You can find out if the part for your tractor has come in without spending two days to walk to town to find out. And you can be alerted to weather… etc. Productivity booms. There's no way the cell phone could have taken off as quickly or efficently as a form of aid, but once someone started engaging with this market, the volume was so huge it just scaled. And the market now competes to be ever more efficient.
Part 3: It's not as easy as it looks
And here's the kicker: If you're a tenth-generation subsistence farmer, your point of view is different from someone working in an R&D lab in Palo Alto.The Moral Economy of the Peasantmakes this argument quite clearly. Imagine standing in water up to your chin. The only thing you're prepared to focus on is whether or not the water is going to rise four more inches. Your penchant for risk is close to zero. One mistake and the game is over.
As a result, it's extremely difficult to sell innovation to this consumer. The line around the block to get into the Apple store is just an insane concept in this community. A promise from a marketer is meaningless, because the marketer isn't part of the town, the marketer will move away, the marketer is, of course, a liar.
Let me add one more easily overlooked point: Western-style consumers have been taught from birth the power of the package. We see the new nano or the new Porsche or the new convertible note on a venture deal and we can easily do the math: [new thing] + [me] = [happier]. We've been taught that an object can make our lives better, that a purchase can make us happier, that the color of the Tiffany's box or the ringing of a phone might/will bring us joy.
That's just not true for someone who hasn't bought a new kind consumer good in a year or two or three or maybe ever. As a result, stores in the developing world tend to be stocked with the classic, the tried and true, because people buy refills of previous purchases, not the new.
No substistence farmer walks to a store or stall saying, ""I wonder what's new today? I wonder if there's a new way for me to solve my problems?"" Every day, people in the West say that very thing as they engage in shopping as a hobby.
You can't simply put something new in front of a person in this market and expect them to buy it, no matter how great, no matter how well packaged, no matter how well sold.
So you see the paradox. A new product and approach and innovation could dramatically improve the life and income of a billion people, but those people have been conditioned to ignore the very tools that are a reflex of marketers that might sell it to them. Fear of loss is greater than fear of gain. Advertising is inefficient and ineffective. And the worldview of the shopper is that they're not a shopper. They're in search of refills.
The answer, it turns out, is in connecting and leading Tribes. It lies in engaging directly and experientially with individuals, not getting distribution in front of markets. Figure out how to use direct selling in just one village, and then do it in ten, and then in a hundred. The broad, mass market approach of a Western marketer is foolish because there is no mass market in places where villagesarethe market.
The (eventual) power of the early adopter
This gentleman is a swami, a leader in his village. He owns a d.light lantern. Why? He could fit all his worldly positions into a rollaboard, and yet he owns a solar lantern, the first man in his village to buy one.
For him, at least this one time, he liked the way it felt to be seen as a leader, to go first, to do an experiment. Perhaps his followers contributed enough that the purchase didn't feel risky. Perhaps the person he bought it from was a friend or was somehow trusted. It doesn't really matter, other than understanding that he's rare.
After he got the lantern, he set it up in front of his house. Every night for six months, his followers would meet on his front yard to talk, to connect and yes, to wonder how long it would be before the lantern would burn out. Six months later, the jury is still out.
One day, months or years from now, the lantern will be seen as obvious and trusted and a safe purchase. But it won't happen as fast as it would happen in Buffalo or Paris. The imperative is simple: find the early adopters, embrace them, adore them, support them, don't go away, don't let them down. And then be patient yet persistent. Mass market acceptance is rare. Viral connections based on experience are the only reliable way to spread new ideas in communities that aren't traditionally focused on the cult of the new.
This raises the bar for customer service and exceptional longevity,  value and design. It means that the only way to successfully engage this  market is with relentless focus on the conversations that tribe leaders  and early adopters choose to have with their peers. All the tools of  the Western mass market are useless here.
Just because it is going to take longer than it should doesn't mean we should walk away. There are big opportunities here, for all of us. It's going to take some time, but it's worth it. [More info:Acumen]",,"Bottom of the pyramid, market opportunity, innovation"
If you want to learn to do marketing…,"then do marketing.
You can learn finance and accounting and media buying from a book. But the best way to truly learn how to do marketing is to market.
You don't have to quit your job and you don't need your boss's permission. There are plenty of ways to get started.
If you see a band you like coming to town, figure out how to promote them and sell some tickets (posters? google ads? PR?). Don't ask, just do it.
If you find a book you truly love, buy 30 and figure out how to sell them all (to strangers).
If you're 12, go door to door selling fresh fruit–and figure out what stories work and which don't.
Set up an online business. Get a candidate you believe in elected to the school board.

Whatever happened to labor?,"Not Labor with a capital L, as in organized labor unions. I mean labor as in skilled workers solving interesting problems. I mean craftspeople who use their hands, their backs and their heads to do important work.
Labor was a key part of the manufacturing revolution. Industrialists needed smart, dedicated, trained laborers to solve interesting problems. Putting things together took more than pressing a few buttons, it took initiative and skill and care.Labor improvised.
It took thirteen years to build the Brooklyn Bridge and more than twenty-five laborers died during its construction. There was not a systematic manual to follow. The people who built it largely figured it out as they went.
The Singer sewing machine, one of the most complex devices of its century, had each piece fitted by hand by skilled laborers.
Sometime after this, once Henry Ford ironed out that whole assembly line thing, things changed. Factories got far more complex and there was less room for improvisation as things scaled.
The boss said, ""do what I say. Exactly what I say.""
Amazingly, labor said something similar. They said to the boss, ""tell us exactly what to do."" In many cases, work rules were instituted, flexibility went away and labor insisted on doing exactly what they had agreed to do, no more, no less. At the time, this probably felt like power. Now we know what a mistake it was.
In a world where labor does exactly what it's told to do, it will be devalued. Obedience is easily replaced, and thus one worker is as good as another. And devalued labor will be replaced by machines or cheaper alternatives. We say we want insightful and brilliant teachers, but then we insist they do their labor precisely according to a manual invented by a committee…
Companies that race to the bottom in terms of the skill or cost of their labor end up with nothing but low margins. The few companies that are able to race to the top, that can challenge workers to bring their whole selves–their human selves–to work, on the other hand, can earn stability and growth and margins. Improvisation still matters if you set out to solve interesting problems.
The future of labor isn't in less education, less OSHA and more power to the boss. The future of labor belongs to enlightened, passionate people on both sides of the plant, people who want to do work that matters.

Not absolute cheap, just relatively cheap. Not even a good value, just cheap. Cheap compared to its non-cheap competition.
At the other end of the spectrum, the prices at the Hermes store appear to be missing a decimal point or two. The attitude is, ""wow, this stuff is expensive.""

"Check-in, Chicken","One way to start every morning with your team is to have them check in. Go around in a circle and let people update and contribute. It's not a silly exercise, in that it helps people speak up and it communicates forward motion.

Yes, we're chicken. We're afraid. The lizard has us by the claws.

None of the above.

Launching the ShipIt Workbook,"Six months ago, I put together a workbook that would help Linchpin readers ship.
After testing it out on hundreds of people, it's now ready for retail sale. [Back in stock… hope to be able to keep up now.]
You can finddetailshere, or jump right to thebuypage (specialpagefor Canadians). The goal? To make you uncomfortable at the beginning of a project (and successful at the end).
Here's the core idea: it's weird to write in a book. When you do, you're making a commitment. You're combining the open-mindedness that reading brings with the physical action of writing. If you do that at every step in a project–and if your co-workers do too–the seemingly slippery decisions that get made appear a lot more solid.
The ShipIt workbook is designed to be worked on in groups (hence the five pack) and it delivers. If you can confront the mechanics or the fear that's slowing down (or even killing) your project, it's easy to fix it now, before it's too late.
There's no digital version, because without writing things down, it can't work. But there is an mp3interviewthat will help you get your arms around how each page works. I'm pricing this first batch at $3.20 each in a pack of five just for the launch. [PS Amazon is having trouble shipping to Canadians right now.

Marketing Halloween,"Some things to think about while the doorbell rings…
There are communities that have moved Halloween from today, because they don't want it to be on a school night.
There are communities that abhor Halloween, arguing that it is a day forSatanistsand other ideas that are anethema.
And there are communities where the goal is to obtain as many chocolate bars as possible. (The hobo costume will always remain the official teenager get up, because you can make one in three minutes).
How did fruit end up as treat non grata?  How did the few giant candy companies end up stamping out variety, selling giant bags of cheap chocolate instead? (Hint: there's huge pressure to do 'the regular kind' as many consumers/homeowners are afraid to stand out in this regard). A great example of peer pressure meeting the race to the bottom.
And in the last few years, how did a trivial kids' holiday turn into a multi-billion dollar bacchanal for adults, complete with ornatehousesand bespokecostumes? Is it because of some well-orchestrated Halloween Marketers of America initiative? It just seemed to happen, didn't it?
My take: Marketing home runs usually happen because the market/tribe/community is itching for a void to be filled, not because a marketer committed some brilliant act of promotion or pricing. The art, then, is to pick your niche, not to freak out about how to yell about it. You can't make a perfect storm, but you can find one.","October 31, 2010","Halloween marketing, community perceptions, consumer behavior"

Pushing back on mediocre professors,"College costs a fortune. It takes a lot of time and it takes a lot of money.

Perhaps you could give us an assignment that actually pushes us to solve interesting problems, overcome our fear or learn something that I could learn in no other way…""
When a professor spends hours in class going over concepts that are clearly covered in the textbook, I think you have an obligation to repeat the part about the debt and say, ""perhaps you could assign this as homework and we could have an actual conversation in class…""
When you discover that one class after another has so many people in a giant room watching a tenured professor far far in the distance, perhaps you could mention the debt part to the dean and ask if the class could be on video so you could spend your money on interactions that actually changed your life.
The vast majority of email I get from college students is filled with disgust, disdain and frustration at how backwards the system is. Professors who neither read nor write blogs or current books in their field. Professors who rely on marketing textbooks that are advertising-based, despite the fact that virtually no professional marketers build their careers solely around advertising any longer.

On buying unmeasurable media,"Should you invest in TV, radio, billboards and other media where you can't measure whether your ad works? Is an ad inNew Yorkmagazine worth 1,000 times as much as a text link on Google? If you're doing the comparison directly, that's how much extra you're paying if you're only measuring direct web visits…
One school of thought is to measure everything. If you can't measure it, don't do it. This is the direct marketer method and there's no doubt it can work.
There's another thought, though: Most businesses (including your competitors) are afraid of big investments in unmeasurable media. Therefore, if you have the resources and the guts, it's a home run waiting to be hit.
Ralph Lauren is a billion dollar brand. Totally unmeasurable. So are Revlon, LVMH, Donald Trump, Andersen Windows, Lady Gaga and hundreds of other mass market brands.

How media changes politics,"If you want to get elected in the US, you need media.
When TV was king, the secret to media was money. If you have money, you can reach the masses. The best way to get money is to make powerful interests happy, so they'll give you money you can use to reach the masses and get re-elected.
Now, though…When attention is scarce and there are many choices, media costs something other than money.It costs interesting.If you are angry or remarkable or an outlier, you're interesting, and your idea can spread. People who are dull and merely aligned with powerful interests have a harder time earning attention, because money isn't sufficient.
Thus, as media moves from TV-driven to attention-driven, we're going to see more outliers, more renegades and more angry people driving agendas and getting elected. I figure this will continue until other voices earn enough permission from the electorate to coordinate getting out the vote, communicating through private channels like email and creating tribes of people to spread the word. (And they need to learn not to waste this permission hassling their supporters for money).

Organizing for joy,"Traditional corporations, particularly large-scale service and manufacturing businesses, are organized for efficiency. Or consistency. But not joy.
McDonalds, Hertz, Dell and others crank it out. They show up. They lower costs. They use a stopwatch to measure output.
The problem with this mindset is that as you approach the asymptote of maximum efficiency, there's not a lot of room left for improvement. Making a Chicken McNugget for .00001 cents less isn't going to boost your profit a whole lot.
Worse, the nature of the work is inherently un-remarkable. If you fear special requests, if you staff with cogs, if you have to put it all in a manual, then the chances of amazing someone are really quite low.
These organizations have people who will try to patch problems over after the fact, instead of motivated people eager to delight on the spot.
The alternative, it seems, is to organize for joy. These are the companies that give their people the freedom (and yes, the expectation) that they will create, connect and surprise. These are the organizations that embrace someone who makes a difference, as opposed to searching for a clause in the employee handbook that was violated.",,"Organizing, Joy, Efficiency"

Efficiency is free,"Philip Crosby wrote a seminal book (Quality is Free) in which he argued that it's cheaper to build things right the first time than it is to fix them later. Obvious now, but heresy in Detroit 1980. Quality quickly became not just a better way to manufacture, it became a marketing benefit as well. Not only was quality cheaper to make, it was cheaper to sell.
I'm struck that we need a new book, call itEfficiency is Free.
It's cheaper to build carpets that don't create poison gas than it is to do the easy thing and let people suffer later. It's cheaper to build an 8 passenger car that gets 30 miles per gallon than it is to suffer the consequences of the12mile per gallon Suburban. It's cheaper to design smaller, lighter and recyclable shipping containersoncethan it is to buy and hassle with billions of foam peanuts in the long run.
So why doesn't everyone do this? For the same reason the quality revolution took a full generation to take hold–it costs moreright now. It takes planning right now. It requires change right now.
Right now will always be difficult. But efficiency is still free.

I'm sure clever counterfeiters will try to game the system, but it's not that hard to make it work.
It's easy to imagine ways that this could be used to increase after-sale connection (offers, insight, instructions, coupons) for all sorts of items, particularly in parts of the world where SMS is cheap and ubiquitous.",,"counterfeit drugs, SMS verification, consumer protection"
Two problems with whining,"The first is that it doesn't work. You can whine about the government or your friends or your job or your family, but nothing will happen except that you'll waste time.
Worse… far worse… is that whining is a reverse placebo. When you get good at whining, you start noticing evidence that makes your whining more true. So you amplify that and immerse yourself in it, thus creating more evidence, more stuff worth complaining about.
If you spent the same time prattling on about how optimistic you are, you'd have to work hard to make that true…","October 22, 2010","whining, negativity, optimism"

"Deliberately uninformed, relentlessly so [a rant]","Many people in the United States purchase one or fewer books every year.
Many of those people have seen every single episode of American Idol. There is clearly a correlation here.
Access to knowledge, for the first time in history, is largely unimpeded for the middle class. Without effort or expense, it’s possible to become informed if you choose. For less than your cable TV bill, you can buy and read an important book every week. Share the buying with six friends and it costs far less than coffee.
Or you can watch TV.
The thing is, watching TV has its benefits. It excuses you from the responsibility of having an informed opinion about things that matter. It gives you shallow opinions or false ‘facts’ that you can easily parrot to others that watch what you watch. It rarely unsettles our carefully self-induced calm and isolation from the world.
I got a note from someone the other day, in which she made it clear that she doesn’t read non-fiction books or blogs related to her industry. And she seemed proud of this.
I was roped into an argument with someone who was sure that ear candling was a useful treatment. Had he read any medical articles on the topic? No. But he knew. Or said he did.
You see a lot of ostensibly smart people in airports, and it always surprises me how few of them use this downtime to actually become more informed. It’s clearly a deliberate act–in our infoculture, it takes work not to expose yourself to interesting ideas, facts, news and points of view. Hal Varian at Google reports that the average person online spends seventy seconds a day reading online news. Ouch.
Not all books are correct or useful. Not all accepted science is correct. The conventional wisdom might just be wrong. But ignoring all of it because the truth is now fashionably situational and in the eye of the beholder is a lame alternative.
I know this rant is nothing new. In fact, people have been complaining about widespread willful ignorance since Brutus or Caesar or whoever invented the salad… the difference now is this: more people than ever are creators. More people than ever go to work to use their minds, not just their hands. And more people than ever have a platform to share their point of view. I think that raises the bar for our understanding of how the world works.
Let’s assert for the moment that you get paid to create, manipulate or spread ideas. That you don’t get paid to lift bricks or hammer steel. If you’re in the idea business, what’s going to improve your career, get you a better job, more respect or a happier day?

Jumping on the brandwagon, if you must coin a phrase.

What does ‘pro-business’ mean?,"What makes a policy or a politician pro business? Some would tell you it includes:
I think these are certainly pro-factory policies. All of them make it easier for the factory to be more efficient, to have more power over workers and to generate short-term profits.
But “business” is no longer the same as “factory”. (Aside: Factories don't have to make stuff… they're any business that focuses on doing what it did yesterday, but cheaper and faster.) It turns out that factory thinking is part of a race to the bottom, to be the cheapest, the easiest place to pollute, the workforce that will take what it can get.
It's not surprising that there's tension here. If you are working hard to cut prices and improve productivity, you might view labor as a cost, not an asset, and you might want as little hindrance as possible in the impact you have on the community. On the other hand, a business based on connection and innovation and flexibility may very well have a different take on it.
I grew up not too far from theLove Canal. It’s a world famous toxic waste dump. While it helped the short tem profits of Hooker, the chemical company that dumped there, it’s not clear that looking the other way was a pro-business strategy. At some point, a healthy and fairly paid community is essential if you want to sell them something.
The oil sands project in Alberta Canada is a factory-friendly effort. So was the lead excavation inPicher, OK. Creating systems that leverage the factory can often lead to financial success (in the short run). The problem is that the future doesn’t belong to efficient factories, because as we train people to look for the cheap, we race to the bottom–and someone else, somewhere else, will win that race.
Perhaps we could see pro-business strategies looking more like this:
Once you’ve seen how difficult it is to start a thriving business in a place without clean water, fast internet connections and a stable government of rational laws, it’s a lot harder to take what we’ve built for granted.
Capital is selfish and it often seeks the highest possible short-term results. But capital isn’t driving our economy any longer, innovation by unique people is. And people aren’t so predictable.
Linchpins are scarce. They can live where they choose, hire whom they want and build organizations filled with other linchpins.

2. Advanced beginner–needs a bit of freedom, but is unable to quickly describe a hierarchy of which parts are more important than others
3. Competent–wants the ability to make plans, create routines and choose among activities
4. Proficient–the more freedom you offer, the more you expect, the more you'll get

Do you need a permit?,"Where, precisely, do you go in order to get permission to make a dent in the universe?
The accepted state is to be a cog. The preferred career is to follow the well-worn path, to read the instructions, to do what we're told. It's safer that way. Less responsibility. More people to blame.
When someone comes along and says, ""not me, I'm going down a different path,"" we flinch. We're not organized to encourage and celebrate the unproven striver. It's safer to tear them down (with their best interests at heart, of course). Better, we think, to let them down easy, to encourage them to take a safer path, to be realistic, to hear it from us rather than the marketplace.
Perhaps, years ago, this was good advice. Today, it's clearly not. In fact, it's disrespectful, ill-advised and short sighted. How dare we cheer when a bold changemaker stumbles?

Generous gifts vs. free samples,"Free isn't always generous. Free can be a legitimate marketing strategy, an ultimately selfish way to increase sales. Once you spread your ideas (and free is the best way to do that), there are all sorts of ways to profit. But don't be confused. Free samples and free ideas and free bonuses are not necessarily generous acts.
A generous gift comes with no transaction foreseen or anticipated. A gift is a gift, not the beginning of a transaction. When you see a Picasso painting at the Met, Picasso doesn't get anything (he's dead). Even his heirs don't get anything. His art is a gift to anyone who sees it.
Giving gifts is a fairly alien endeavor. In most families, even the holidays are more about presentexchangethan the selfless act of actually giving a gift.
The cool part, the punchline, is that giving a gift for no reason and with no transaction contemplated is actually incredibly powerful.

Next!
You might have already guessed the problems (there are at least two.) The first is that this is no way to do your work, your art, your chosen craft. Averaging the work down, achieving the least, getting it done–that's no way to spend your day. You deserve more than that.
The other problem is that you have competition. And for them, perhaps even this time, it's not just another in a long line of tasks. It's the one. The one that matters. The competition will bring more to the table than you do, and you suffer.
Perhaps the alternative is instead of thinking, ""next!"", we can think, ""last!""

The business of software,"Inspired by a talk I gave yesterday at theBOSconference. This is long, feel free to skip!
My first real job was leading a team that created five massive computer games for the Commodore 64. The games were so big they needed four floppy disks each, and the project was so complex (and the hardware systems so sketchy) that on more than one occasion, smoke started coming out of the drives.
Success was a product that didn't crash, start a fire or lead to a nervous breakdown.
Writing software used to be hard, sort of like erecting a building used to be hundreds of years ago. When you set out to build an audacious building, there were real doubts about whether you might succeed. It was considered a marvel if your building was a little taller and didn't fall down. Now, of course, the hard part of real estate development has nothing to do with whether or not your building is going to collapse.
The same thing is true of software. It’s a given that a professionally run project will create something that runs. Good (not great) software is a matter of will, mostly.
The question used to be: Does it run? That was enough, because software that worked was scarce.
Now, the amount of high utility freeware and useful free websites is soaring. Clearly, just writing a piece of software no longer makes it a business.
So if it’s not about avoiding fatal bugs, what’s the business of software?
At its heart, you need to imagine (and then execute) a business that just happens to involve a piece of software, because it’s become clear that software alone isn’t the point. There isn’t a supply issue–it’s about demand. The business of software is now marketing (which includes design).
The internet has transformed the software industry in two vaguely related ways:
1. It makes it far more efficient to communicate with people who might buy your software and,2. It enables software’s most powerful function: communication between users
Let’s take them one at a time:
COMMUNICATE TO USERS: As we’ve seen in just about every industry, marketing involves effectively communicating a story about benefits to (and among) the people who will appreciate them. For software entrepreneurs, this means identifying a group of people who need the utility of what you can offer them and who are willing to give you permission to educate them about why they should buy. Without either element, the software is dead.
Over time, this permission becomes the core asset of the company. Selling upgrades, for example, is a great revenue path for software companies because of the ease of alerting current users about the upgrade.
I think niche opportunities for software are largely unexploited. There are countless tribes of people who would eagerly try and ultimately benefit from software optimized for their needs. A simple example:Firehouse.comis a website for firefighters. They have tens of thousands of members and hundreds of contributing writers and bloggers. Is it possible to imagine software that would help a fireman during a typical day? If you could, here's a group ready to listen.
The amplification of tens of thousands of tribal niches online creates a significant opportunity for specialized software worth paying for.
So, the questions I’d ask:
ENABLE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN USERS: This is the holy grail of software, and has been since multi-player games, email, ICQ and the web revolutionized the way we thought about computers.
It’s hard to imagine, but twenty years ago, this is not what we thought about when we turned on a computer or went to the store to buy software. (Yes, the store–that’s where you bought software). The purpose of software was to interact with a device, not another person. Old software had no network effect.
The network effect is the increased utility of a device that enables communication. One fax machine is useless, two are good, a thousand are a vital tool. One user of software is lonely, a million is a sea change in the way we communicate. Software enjoys a central role in the network effect–if you can improve productivity or satisfaction by connecting people, then people will selfishly help you do your marketing.
When building a software business that uses the network effect, I’d ask:
Worth taking a minute to think about that last question. eBay, for example, is a business because instead of developing an open protocol that would have enabled anyone to run an auction anywhere on any platform, Pierre Omidyar built a piece of software that was easy to use and open to changes in content–but required all the users to usehissoftware. Compare that to the many pieces of software middleware that depend on Twitter content to work. Since the feed from Twitter is software independent, it’s very difficult for a middleman to earn the privilege of charging much at all. The user can easily switch to a different middleman with little or no hassle.
What you’re looking for in a connected world is a piece of software that sits in the middle of a sphere, enabling the user to make valuable connections, to build utility in a way that they couldn’t without you. That’s worth paying for and not worth switching out of.
LAST THING: Paying for it
In a competitive market where the marginal cost of an item is zero, the price will move to and eventually reach zero. If it doesn’t cost you (or your competitors) anything to add one more user, then in a truly competitive market, there will be a race to add users, even if the next one doesn’t add any revenue.
The goal, then, is to create a dynamic where the market isn’t competitive. Back to the eBay example: copying the functionality of their software is now easy and cheap. You could probably build something way better, in fact. But switching is hugely expensive for the user, because all the buyers and all the sellers are there, not with you. It’s not a competitive marketplace.
The other condition that’s necessary, though, is that users have to believe that payment is an option. The web has trained the vast majority that interactions online should be free. That makes the act of selling software, particularly to people who haven’t used it yet, really difficult.
There are two ways around this:1. Free samples. Many software companies (37signals being an obvious one) have discovered the drug dealer model, in which the software is free for a month, connections are built, utility is created andthenit begins to cost money.
2. Move to a platform where commerce is expected. They sell a lot of candy at bookstore cash registers, because wallets are already out and people are feeling in the mood for a treat to leaven their purchase of some intellectual tome. The app store for the iPad is like that. The expectation is that this software is going to cost money. It’s far easier to sell a serious app for the iPad than it is on the web, because the platform is organized around commerce.
A long post, sure, but I wanted to help you realize that just because you can code something that doesn’t mean it’s a good idea. The issues of permission, of networks, of scarcity and of the desire to pay are inherent in the business part of the business of software. I think we’re at the very beginning of the arc of software as business, and I can’t wait to see what you come up with next.","October 5, 2010","software business, marketing, network effect"

Twenty years ago, self-publishing a record was difficult and expensive. A big label could get you shelf space at Tower easily, you couldn't. A big label could pay for a recording session with available capital, but it was difficult for you to find the money or take the risk. A big label could reach the dozens of music reviewers, and do it with credibility. Hard for you to do that yourself.
Now?
Now when someone comes to a successful musician and says, ""we'll take 90% and you do all the work,"" they're opening the door to an uncomfortable conversation. The label has no assets, just desire. That's great, but that's exactly what the musician has, and giving up so much pie (and control over his destiny) hardly seems like a fair trade.

When you criticize my choices…,"I'm less likely to trust your judgment, because you just challenged mine.
I was the victim of a business to business sales call. After the introductions, the CEO of the company pitching me started badmouthing a firm I've worked with. I had just finished talking about how much I liked working with them and how I respected what they were trying to do.
As she and a few other people chimed in with their take on how misguided, lousy and doomed this company was, I couldn't help but notice myself thinking less of my hosts. The only other choice I had was to think less ofme… and it was easier and more fun to think less oftheminstead.
Far more effective, I think, to congratulate the judgment of your prospect based on the information they had at the time, or the goals they had at the time or the resources they had at the time. In fact, it's almost certainly true thatgiven the information, goals and resources they had when they made the decision, they did exactly the right thing.

A modern Thanksgiving would celebrate two things:
The people in our lives who give us the support and love we need to make a difference, and…
The opportunity to build something bigger than ourselves, something worth contributing. The ability to make connections, to lend a hand, to invent and create.

The full day publishing seminar,"[I'm told this sold out already. Perhaps I'll do another one soon. Sorry to disappoint… ].
Book publishing is in the throes of serious change, from format to content to marketing. Since my first book in 1986, I've been thinking about this–as a writer, a self-publisher, an ebook creator and as a marketer. I've probably had my hands on 200 books or booklike projects over the last twenty-five years, and I've learned a lot.
For the first time, I'm running a seminar to talk about it. This is a day, at the fabulous Helen Mills Theater in New York City, to understand how effective book publishing works starting now. I'll talk about what's worked and what hasn't, describe my vision for how an asset can be built going forward, and most of all, interact with you about your projects and opportunities.
Because everyone in the room has a similar agenda, we'll be able to focus really closely on how the new marketing and the changes in our world are going to impact our industry.
The day is created with writers, editors, agents and publishers in mind. I believe now more than ever that a book has a significant impact, that it can change minds and that it can be part of a useful business model as well.

Groping for a marketing solution: TSA and security theater,"There's plenty ofcontroversyabout the new full body scanners that the TSA is installing at airports, and plenty more about the way some TSA agents arehandlingthose that choose to opt out.
The heart of the matter comes from the fact that the TSA often doesn't understand that it is in show business, not security business. A rational look at the threats facing travelers would indicate that intense scrutiny of a four ounce jar of mouthwash or aggressive frisking of achildis a misplaced use of resources. If the goal is to find dangerous items in cargo or track down Stinger missiles, this isn't going to help.
Instead, the mission appears to be twofold:
1. Reassure the public that the government is really trying and
2. Keep random bad actors off guard by frequently raising the bar on getting caught
The challenge with #1 is that if people believe they're going to get groped, or get cancer, or have to wait in line even longer on Thanksgiving, they cease to be on your side. Particularly once they realize how irrational it is to try to stop a threat after it's already been perpetrated. (Imagine the havoc if someone had a brassiere-based weapon…)
And the challenge of #2 is that the cost of raising the bar gets higher and higher.
Smart marketers know how to pivot. I think it's time to do that. Start marketing the idea that flying is safe, like driving, but it's not perfect, like driving. If someone is crazy enough to hurt themselves or spend their life in jail, we're not going to stop them, and even if we did, they'd just cause havoc somewhere else. So instead of spending billions of dollars a year in time and money pretending, let's just get back to work.

"Sure, but what’s the hard part?","Every project (product, play, event, company, venture, non profit) has a million tasks that need to be done, thousands of decisions, predictions, bits of effort, conversations and plans.
Got that.
But what's the hard part?
The CEO spends ten minutes discussing the layout of the office with the office manager. Why? Was that a difficult task that could only be done by her? Unlikely.
The founder of a restaurant spends hours at the cash register, taking orders and hurrying the line along… important, vital, emotional, but hard? Not if we think of hard as the chasm, the dividing line between success and failure. No, the hard part is raising two million dollars to build more stores. Hard is hiring someone better than you to do this part of the job.
Hard is not about sweat or time, hard is about finishing the rare, valuable, risky task that few complete.

Embracing the upcycle instead of the downcycle,"Does a stressful event start a cascade that ends up making even you more stressed?
If an authority figure corrects your behavior, does the intervention lead you to push back and make the behavior worse?
Does a failure set you on a path to more failure?
These questions seem philosophical or even paradoxical, but in fact I think they get to the heart of why some people succeed and others don't. We can choose to create cycles that move us up or endure cycles that drag us down.
A cop hassles a teenager who is acting out. The kid escalates. The cop escalates. Someone gets shot.
A sales call is going poorly because the prospect doesn't perceive the salesperson is confident. She responds by becoming even less confident. No sale.
A mistake is made. The stakes go up. Rattled, another mistake is made, and then again, until failure occurs…
James Bond is a hero because the tougher the world got, the cooler he got. Symphony conductors don't endure the pressure of a performance, they thrive on it.
If being alittlebehind creates self-pressure that leads to stress and then errors, it's no wonder you frequently end up alotbehind. If the way you manage your brand inevitably leads to a ceaseless race to the bottom, it's no wonder that you're struggling. A small bump gets magnified and repeated until it overwhelms.
Customer service falls apart when mutual escalation or non-understanding sets in. Management falls apart when power struggles or miscommunication escalate. Education falls apart when students respond to negative tracking by giving up.
Someone who gets better whenever he fails will always outperform someone who responds to failure by getting worse. This isn't something in your DNA, it's something you can learn or unlearn.
The appropriate response is not to try harder, to bear down and grind it out. The response that works is to understand the nature of the cycle and to change it from the start. You must not fight the cycle, you must transform it into a different cycle altogether. It's a lot of work, but less work than failing.
When the lizard pushes you to recoil in fear, that's your cue to embrace the trembling fear and do precisely the opposite of what it demands. This won't work the first time or even the tenth, but it's the path to an upcycle, one where each negative input leads to more productivity, not less.","November 18, 2010","upcycle, stress, cycles"

You can earn my business or my recommendation if the build quality is unreasonable for the intended use, if the pricing is unreasonably low or if the experience is unreasonably over-the-top irresistible given the competition.
Want to get into a famous college? You'll need to have unreasonably high grades, impossibly positive recommendations and yes, a life that's balanced. That's totally unreasonable.

Arrogance is a bug in signal processing,"We care a lot about finding people who are brilliant, who get things done, who make a difference. We care a lot about finding a playwright with talent, a surgeon who can cure us, a programmer who can get the thing to work.

We often put up with this, because, after all, they're superstars, right?
Somewhere along the way, we confused the signals with the work. Now there are people whostartwith the bad behavior and the affectations, hoping that it will be seen as a sign of insight and talent. And they often get away with it. ""Who's that?"" we wonder… ""I don't know, but they must be good at what they do, because why else would we put up with them?""

First, you have to care. When people care about a brand or a cause or an idea, it's likely that have other things in common. And the caring causes them to invest attention. Once they've done that, they can't help but notice that others don't see things the way they do. We ignore the great unwashed and reserve our disdain for those like us, that care like us, but don't see things as we do.

Hire an architect,"Architects don't manufacture nails, assemble windows or chop down trees. Instead, they take existing components and assemble them in interesting and important ways.
It used to be that if you wanted to build an organization, you had to be prepared to do a lot of manufacturing and assembly–of something. My first internet company had 60 or 70 people at its peak… and today, you could run the same organization with six people. The rest? They were busy building an infrastructure that now exists. Restaurants used to be built by chefs. Now, more than ever, they're built by impresarios who know how to tie together real estate, promotion, service and chefs into a package that consumers want to buy. The difficult part isn't installing the stove, the difficult (and scarce) part is telling a story.
I'm talking about intentionally building a structure and a strategy and a position, not focusing your energy on the mechanics, because mechanics alone are insufficient. Just as you can't build a class A office building with nothing but a skilled carpenter, you can't build a business for the ages that merely puts widgets into boxes.
My friend Jerry calls these people corporate chiropractors. They don't do surgery, they realign and recognize what's out of place.
Organizational architects know how to find suppliers, use the cloud (of people, of data, of resources), identify freelancers, tie together disparate resources and weave them into a business that scales. You either need to become one or hire one.

"No knight, no shining armor","""Sure, Seth can do that, because he has a popular blog.""
Some people responded to my decision to forgo traditional publishers (not traditional books, btw) by pointing out that I can do that because I have a way of reaching readers electronically.
What they missed is that this asset is a choice, not an accident.
Does your project depend on a miracle, a bolt of lightning, on being chosen by some arbiter of who will succeed? I think your work is too important for you to depend on a lottery ticket. In some ways, this is the work of the Resistance, an insurance policy that gives you deniability if the project doesn't succeed.

Seeking market resonance,"If you've ever wasted time at a catered affair, you know the water glass trick. Half full glass, wet finger, hold the bottom of the glass and then slide your finger around and around the top of the glass.
As you move your finger, the glass will vibrate. Move it just right (a function of the amount of water and the thickness of the glass) and the glass starts to sing. Do it really well and it sings so loud you might be able to shatter the glass and get into all sorts of trouble.
This is what most marketers seek (not the trouble part, the singing part).
The market awaits your innovation. Things that might make it vibrate and resonate don't work. Then some do. It's not always obvious before you start what the right entry point is, what the right product is, what the right speed is. And knowing that you don't know is the most important place to start.
Honing your music or your presentation or your business plan or your store's inventory are all efforts to resonate. Smart marketers are hyper-alert for what's working, for what's starting to get people to prick  their ears.

“I don’t have any good ideas”,"Now Iknowyou're bluffing.

Second, and way more telling, what happens if I give you a good idea. Here. Take it. Now what? You have it, right?
Now you need to find a second reason for not making things happen. ""I don't have enough time."" ""I can't get the resources."" ""I'm not sure, really sure, guaranteed, that this is a good idea."" ""My boss won't let me.""

For years, Apple viewed retail distribution as a constraint. They had to live with cranky independent computer stores, or big box mass merchants that didn't display or sell their products well.
Using the internet and then their own stores, they eventually realized that this was actually a problem that could be solved, and it changed everything for them.
On the other hand, there are countless entrepreneurs who believe they can solve problems relating to funding or technology that are out of reach given their scale or background. They'd be better off if they accepted them as constraints and designed around them.

Alienating the 2%,"When a popular rock group comes to town, some of their fans won't get great tickets. Not enough room in the front row. Now they're annoyed. 2% of them are angry enough to speak up or badmouth or write an angry letter.
When Disney changes a policy and offers a great new feature or benefit to the most dedicated fans, 2% of them won't be able to use it… timing or transport or resources or whatever. They're angry and they let the brand know it.
Do the math. Every time Apple delights 10,000 people, they hear from 200 angry customers, people who don't like the change or the opportunity or the risk it represents.
If you have fans or followers or customers, no matter what you do, you'll annoy or disappoint two percent of them. And you'll probably hear a lot more from the unhappy 2% than from the delighted 98.
It seems as though there are only two ways to deal with this: Stop innovating, just stagnate. Or go ahead and delight the vast majority.
Sure, you can try to minimize the cost of change, and you might even get the number to 1%. But if you try to delight everyone, all the time, you'll just make yourself crazy. Or become boring.","November 6, 2010","customer dissatisfaction, brand loyalty, innovation"

Laziness,"I think laziness has changed.
It used to be about avoiding physical labor. The lazy person could nap or have a cup of tea while others got hot and sweaty and exhausted. Part of the reason society frowns on the lazy is that this behavior means more work for the rest of us.
When it came time to carry the canoe over the portage, I was always hard to find. The effort and the pain gave me two good reasons to be lazy.
But the new laziness has nothing to do with physical labor and everything to do with fear. If you're not going to make those sales calls or invent that innovation or push that insight, you're not avoiding it because you need physical rest. You're hiding out because you're afraid of expending emotional labor.
This is great news, because it's much easier to become brave about extending yourself than it is to become strong enough to haul an eighty pound canoe.","November 4, 2010","laziness, emotional labor, fear"
Helping the rejection committee,"Liz quotes a friend who sold expensive business to business products in Texas, ""It's not a no until they call security!"" This salesperson has no intention whatsoever of helping the folks who reject her do the rejecting.
I'm not sure you have to go that far, but I know that many marketers work hard on behalf of the rejection committee. We sabotage our college applications or email pitches or websites, predicting in advance that we're not going to make it, not good enough, not worthy. So we set out to save them the trouble of having to think hard about the no.

How can you do it?!,"JK asks,
""It's like, how does anyone start their own business? How is it even possible? How do they deal with the crippling fear and harsh economic realities?""
Some people believe that if you have a good job, you shouldn't start your own gig, because it's foolish to give up a job you can't easily replace.
And some people believe that if you don't have a great job, it's foolish to waste time (and the money you can ill afford to lose) starting something when you'd be a lot better off getting a great job or going to school until you do.
And both groups are missing the point.
The people who successfully start independent businesses (franchises, I think are a different thing) do it because we have no real choice in the matter. The voice in our heads won't shut up until we discover if we're right, if we can do it, if we can make something happen. This is an art, our art, and to leave it bottled up is a crime.

"Voting, misunderstood","This year, fewer than40% of voting age Americans will actually vote.
A serious glitch in self-marketing, I think.
If you don't vote because you're trying to teach politicians a lesson, you're tragically misguided in your strategy. The very politicians you're trying to send a message todon't want you to vote. Since 1960, voting turnouts in mid-term elections are down significantly, and there's one reason: because of TV advertising.
Political TV advertising is designed to do only one thing: suppress the turnout of the opponent's supporters. If the TV ads can turn you off enough not to vote (""they're all bums"") then their strategy has succeeded.
The astonishing thing is that voters haven't figured this out. As the scumminess and nastiness of campaigning and governing has escalated and the flakiness of candidates appears to have escalated as well, we've largely abdicated the high ground and permitted selfish partisans on both sides to hijack the system.
Voting is free. It's fairly fast. It doesn't make you responsible for the outcome, but it sure has an impact on what we have to live with going forward. The only thing that would make it better is free snacks.

I'm guessing that at some point, management said, ""it's good enough,"" and moved on to more pressing issues. And then, of course, it stays good enough, frozen in time, ignored, and annoying.
The problem with letting your web forms become annoying is that in terms of time spent interacting with your brand, they're way up on the list. If someone is spending a minute or two or three or four cursing you out from their desk, it's not going to be easily fixed with some clever advertising.
Here's an illustrated guide to things to avoid, JetBlue style:

First interaction wasn't so great. If you even bother to build a ""please wait"" page, be sure it says something useful, or perhaps interesting, as opposed to confusing. Should I press continue?
Throughout the form, JetBlue frequently asks for dates (of birth, say, or issuance). Everywhere else on their site (and in the country they're based) the format for dates is July 10, 1960. But here, just this one time, the format is 10, July 1960. And you can't just type in the date, which is fast, you need to wrestle with pull down menus, menus too dumb to list all twelve months of the year at once, but instead requiring you to scroll if any date is after April…

Alert readers know that pull down menus with more than thirty total choices are a pettyannoyancefor me, and this one is particularly vexing. There a more than a hundred and fifty countries here, including a few I have never heard of. The United States, home to 90% of JetBlue's customers, is listed near the bottom, but not at it (hint: if you insist on this sort of error in form design, list the popular choices at the top, at the bottomandin alpha… no penalty for multiple listings). (A far better alternative is the auto-completion guessing trick Google now uses in search).
Worse, if you try to type the country (U…n…i) it takes you to… TUNISIA!
Four passengers; 8 times I had to scroll down all the way, then slowly scroll up and then click…
It gets more annoying. For each passenger, I had to choose, ""Travel document type"". But of course, there's only one travel document permitted, ""Passport"" which hardly requires a pull down choice I think. Rule of thumb: when in doubt about a question, don't bother asking.
They also wanted to know the nationality of traveler, which is fine, but then two items later, they wanted to know, ""Issuing country."" While I'm confident that there are a few travelers who have a nationality in one country and an issuing country in another, my guess is that it would be considered a nice gesture if the form remembered your answer from three seconds ago and automatically entered it for you, no?
After painstakingly filling out the form, I was presented with these two buttons at the bottom of the page… hmmmmm.

Doesn't really matter which one I pressed, though, because lady and the tiger style, I got this:

NOOOOOOOO!
And I had to start the entire form over again, from the beginning, with no fields remembered.
I know, I know, this is a rant. But it's a rant with a point:
Fill in your own forms. Make your executives do it. Watch customers do it. See what your competitors are using. Improve the form. Don't use pull down menus for more than 12 choices unless there really is no choice.

Zig Ziglar used to tell a story about a baseball team on a losing streak. On the road for a doubleheader, the team visited a town that was home to a famous faith healer. While the guys were warming up, the manager disappeared. He came back an hour later with a big handful of bats. ""Guys, these bats were blessed and healed by the guru. Our problems are over.""
According to the story, the team snapped out of their streak and won a bunch of games. Some people wonder, ""did the faith healerreallytouch the bats, or was the manager making it up?"" Huh? Does it matter?
Mass marketers have traditionally abhorred measurement, preferring rules of thumb, casting calls and alchohol instead. Yet, there's no real correlation between how the ad was made and how well it works.
As the number of apparently significant digits in the data available to us goes up (traffic was up .1% yesterday!) we continually seek causation, even if we're looking in the wrong places. As the amount of data we get continues to increase, we need people who can help us turn that data into information.
It's important, I think, to understand when a placebo is helpful and when it's not. We shouldn't look topoliticiansto tell us whether or not the world is gettingwarmer(and what's causing it). They're not qualified or motivated to turn the data into information. We also shouldn't look to a fortune teller on the corner to read our x-rays or ourblood tests.

It's so tempting to shut people down, to limit the upside, to ostracize, select and demonize. It makes things a lot simpler. Not seeing means you don't have to take action. Not opening means it's easier to announce that you're done. And not raising the bar means you're less likely to fail.
Just about all the things we treasure in our world were built by people who were intent on making things bigger, enabling things to be better, opening doors for us to achieve. The line between a realist and a optimist is hard to draw. And both might be self-fulfilling.

Three ways TV changed everything (and what’s next),"TV changes everyone it touches.
TV bringsmass. For fifty years, TV meant that programmers and advertisers had a very good chance to reach everyone, or almost everyone, at the same time. TV integrates a culture, because there's instant common touchstones being generated daily. (When I say, ""yadda yadda yadda"" or ""where's the beef,"" you know what I mean, right?)
TV bringspluralismand diversity. This seems to contradict the first, but it doesn't. Once TV has opened a channel to the brain, it can bring in whatever it chooses, without clearing it with you first. So, the viewer can discover that people-who-don't-look-like-us aren't so different, or that women might be good cops, or that a member of the [insert oppressed group] might also be a person too.
and finally, TV bringsdissatisfaction. Advertising needs to make you dissatisfied to work. And picture perfect sitcom families have more money and less trouble than most folks (because they're not real).
Now, of course, TV isn't what it used to be. No more three-channel universe. That means that the cable/internet virus changes everyone in a very different way. Call it the million channel world (mcw).
The mcw brings addressability. There is no mass any more. You can't reach everyone. Mad Men is a hit and yet it has only been seen by 2% of the people in the USA.
The mcw bring silos, angry tribes and insularity. Fox News makes a fortune by pitting people against one another.Talkingpointsmemois custom tailored for people who are sure that the other side is wrong. You can spend your entire day consuming media and never encounter a thought you don't agree with, don't like or don't want to see.
And finally, I have no idea if the mcw is making us happy. Surely, a substantial use is time wasting social network polishing, and that's not really building anyone's long-term happiness. And the mcw makes it easier to get angry, to waste time (there's never 'nothing on') or become isolated. Without a doubt, the short-term impact of mcw is that it makes it easy to spread terror and harder to settle on the truth. At the same time, there's no doubt that more people are connected to more people, belong to more tribes, have more friends, and engage more often than they did before it got here. We got rid of some gatekeepers, but there's a race for some new ones. In the meantime, a lot of smart people are fending for themselves, which isn't so bad.

Zig taught me this twenty years ago. Make your schedulebeforeyou start. Don't allow setbacks or blocks or anxiety to push you to say, ""hey, maybe I should check my email for a while, or you know, I could use a nap."" If you do that, the lizard brain is quickly trained to use that escape hatch again and again.

Do elite trappings create success? (Causation vs. correlation),"Does a ski trip to Aspen make you a successful bond trader, or do successful bond traders go skiing in Aspen?
It's college acceptance season, and worth considering an often overlooked question:
Do people who are on track to become successful go to elite colleges, buy elite cars, engage in other elite behaviors… (Defining elite as something both scarce and thus expensive).
or
Do attending these colleges or engaging in these behaviors make you successful?
It matters, because if you're buying the elite label as a shortcut to success, you might be surprised at what you get.
There are certainly exceptions (for professions that are very focused on a credential, and for the economically disadvantaged), but generally, most elite products like college are overrated as life changers.
It turns out that merely getting intoHarvardis as good an indicator of future success as actually going. It turns out that being the sort of person that can invest the effort, conquer fear and/or raise the money to capture some of the elite trappings of visible success is what drives success, not the other way around.
The learning matters a great deal, and especially the focused effort behind it. The brand name of the institution, not so much.

"High margins, Groupon and the magic basket for price differentiators","Some things sell for not much more than they cost to make. Things like steel.
Others? They sell for high multiples of cost. Spa services, fancy ties, long haul airplane tickets, coaching, books–these are things that might cost a bunch to set up, but once the factory is rolling, the marginal cost of one more unit is really low. The challenge, then, is to find a way to get new customers without alienating the folks that have paid full price. Even better, to turn those new trial customers into loyal customers.
One of the challenges of selling to new customers cheap is that you might end up with a price shopper, someone who isalwayscheap, someone who will never convert into the kind of customer your high margin business needs to survive.
Priceline was a pioneer in figuring out how to isolate one customer type from another. The reason the original Priceline was so incredibly difficult to use (with blind reverse auctions, etc.) was that they wanted it that way. Anyone who was willing to through that hassle and anxiety to save $100 bucks for a ticket on Delta was clearly not someone Delta was going to have an easy time selling a regular ticket to. In other words, Jay Walker had figured out how to create a second type of air travel. One for cheapskates. The alternative to Priceline was a bus ticket or no travel at all… And Delta was fine with offloading excess seats to them, because they didn't have to worry about alienating their core customer.
Groupon is a very different thing. Here, it's not a hassle, it's the fun factor. Buying this way is exciting, you never know what's next, you do it with friends, the copy is funny, it's an adventure. As a result, many Groupon customers in fact do convert to becoming long time patrons of the place they tried, because they're not inherently cheap shoppers. When they're on Groupon they're hunting for fun. But if you offer an astonishing product and great service after they try you, they may convert into shopping with you for the long haul, not because you're a Groupon replacement, but because you bring them more than the alternatives.
And the magic basket?Tim Ferrissjust finished offering more than $1600 worth of high-margin items in a basket to people who bought 30 copies of his new book. The marketing partners get trial among a group of people who are each paying more than the cost of a single item in the basket, these customers are proving they're not among the ultra-cheap. And the products are quasi-aligned, appealing to the same sort of consumer. Is there a cheaper way for one of these companies to reach this precise person? I'm not sure there is.
Imagine taking this even further and leaving out the book part. A basket of aligned items, all high margin, none from the market dominator, each holding out the possibility of future business… You could do this with an 8 pack ofcomputergames or phone apps, or drink coupons from a dozen bars in the same town, or even clothing for guys size 38. Alex has experimented with this atSwagapalooza. I'm betting that there's quite a lot to be done in becoming this market creator/differentiator/middleman.
What's missing so far is an intelligent way to get permission, to follow up, to further organize those that do a trial and teach them and connect them so that they see a further incentive in sticking with the thing they just tried.
What's also missing is a willingness on the part of high-margin marketers to use their products and these sort of interactions as a replacement for the unmeasurable and largely ineffective lifestyle advertising they use now.
The net, once again, is making it easier to find and organize tribes of people, even for short durations. When you intersect these aligned groups with high-margin products, you can create fascinating commerce opportunities.","December 14, 2010","High margins, price differentiation, customer loyalty"
The myth of the simple business plan,"The status quo is accepted, regardless how complex, but we demand the new thing be simple.
Here's a business plan for a textbook manufacturer ca. 1955:
Hire a professor, pay them to spend years making a textbook. Hire a lot of salespeople, have them visit other professors and their committees, selling them a book they won't ultimately buy, but will merely force others to buy. Then build an infrastructure to make sure the bookstores have the book that the students are instructed to buy against their will. Then add meaningless updates to the book regularly so the used textbook market doesn't impinge on new book sales.
If someone pitched you that business model a century ago, you'd laugh.
Most giant industries have similarly convuluted plans. For some reason, we require new business models to be far more elegant…

We're not going to have a lot of luck persuading masses of semi-interested people to seek out and embrace complicated answers, but we can take two steps to lead to better information exchange:
1. Take complicated overall answers and make them simple steps instead. Teach complexity over time, simply.
2. Teach a few people, the committed, to embrace the idea of complexity. That's what a great college education does, for example. That's what makes someone a statesman instead of a demagogue. Embracing complexity is a scarce trait, worth acquiring. But until your customers/voters/employees do, I think the first strategy is essential.

The Domino Project,"Book publishing is changing. It’s changing faster than it has in a hundred years. I’ve been persistent enough to be part of that change, provoking andpokingand wondering about what comes next.
Today, I’m thrilled to report on what’s next for me.
The notion of the paper book as merely a package for information is slowly becoming obsolete. There must be other reasons on offer, or smart people will go digital, or read something free. The book is still an ideal tool for the hand-to-hand spreading of important ideas, though. The point of the book is to be spread, to act as a manifesto, to get in sync with others, to give and to get and to hand around.
Our goal is to offer ideas that people need and want to spread, to enjoy and to hold and to own, and to change conversations.
Working with a great team at Amazon, I’m launching a new publishing venture calledThe Domino Project.I think it fundamentally changes many of the rules of publishing trade non-fiction.
Trade publishing (as opposed to textbooks or other non-consumer ventures) has always been about getting masses of people to know about, understand and read your books. The business has been driven by several foundational principles:
1. The middleman (the bookstore) has a great deal of power. There’s only a limited amount of shelf space, and there are more books (far more books) than we have room for. No display, no sale. That’s one reason books are published with the economically ridiculous model of 100% returns from bookstores. Huge stores can carry thousands of books and return them if they don’t sell. Large chains get a say about what’s on the cover, what the title is, and they even get paid for shelf displays.
2. The audience (the reader) is largely unknown to the publisher, and thus to the author. Authors with large followings still have to start over with each book, because they don’t have permission (or the data) to contact loyal readers directly.
3. Pricing and product are static and slow. Once a book is published, the price is set forever. Add to that the glacial speed from conception to publication date and you see a system that is set up to benefit neither the publisher nor the reader.
4. Books are inherently difficult to spread. The ideas in books might travel, but the act of recommending a book, having the idea stick and a new sale get made is slow or broken. Given how important the ideas in books are, this chain has many weak links. It's worth rethinking how a publishing house could organize around its ultimate goal, which is to spread ideas.
The internet and the Kindle are changing all of these rules. The Domino Project is designed to (at least by way of example) remap many of these foundations.
1. There is no middleman. Because there is infinite shelf space, the publisher has more control over what the reader sees and how. In addition, the Amazon platform allows a tiny organization to have huge reach without taking significant inventory risk. ""Powered by Amazon” is part of our name—it describes the unique nature of the venture… I get to figure out the next neat idea, and Amazon can handle printing, logistics and the platform for connection.
2. The reader is tightly connected with the publisher and the author. If you like the sort of things I write or recommend, you can sign uphere(for free, using your email) and we can alert you to new works, send you free samples and otherwise make it easy for you to be smart about the new ideas that are generated. (RSSworks too).
3. Pricing can vary based on volume, on timing, on format. With this project, I’ve made the decision to ignore the rules that publishers follow to get on the New York Times bestseller list. There’s no point in compromising the consumer experience or the product merely to get a nice ego boost and a small shot of promotion. More on this in a future post, but I'll let you use your imagination.
4. Digital goods and manifestos in book form make it easier to spread complex ideas. It’s long frustrated me that a blog post can reach 100 times as many people as a book, but can’t deliver the nuance a book can. The Domino Project is organized around a fundamentally different model of virality, one that allows authors to directly reach people who can use the ideas we’re writing about.
The Domino Project is named for the domino effect—ideas can quickly spread, moving through a previously static set up. Our mission isn’t to become a promotional machine, focused on interrupting large numbers of people or having significant promotional chops through traditional media. Instead, we're grabbing the opportunity to choose and deliver manifestos that are optimized for the tribe, for the small group that wants to grab them, inhale them and spread them. The good ones will spread, first from person to person, then from one circle to another, and eventually into large groups.
That’s a lot to absorb for one post. I’ve been working on the ideas behind The Domino Project since I published my very first book in 1986. The first manifestos won’t be out for a few months, but you can learn more as we go by following the Domino Project bloghere.

What amazed me, though, was what he did during those rare times when therewasn'ta car in front of us, just open road.
He didn't speed up. In fact, it seemed as though he slowed down.
He was comfortable with the competitive nature of passing (I may not be fast, but I'm faster than you), and he was petrified of the open road and the act of choosing his own speed.
Of course, we do the same thing with our career or our businesses. Most of us need competition to tell us how fast to go.","December 7, 2010","driving, competition, career"
In search of accomplices,"Regular readers know that I've run a few free intensive education programs in my office. You can see details about themhere,hereandhere.
Starting in four weeks, I'm trying a different approach. A paid 7 month gig helping me build a significant new publishing venture (I'll be announcing the details of the venture here on Wednesday morning).
I'm looking for two or three people to work with me in my office outside of New York, engaged in every element of the project, from copywriting and editing to social media to business development to promotion. My goal is to offer you a hands on experience with full exposure to the market, to technology and to shipping great work out the door. When we're done, I think you'll be qualified to start your own gig or find a great job in media.
There's anonline application, then an in person interview for a few people in mid-December and we start January 4th. Obviously, this means you'll need easy access to New York, valid work permits and fantastic verbal, technical and writing skills. I'm offering each person as much education as I can, along with a $25,000 stipend in exchange for their work.
If you know someone who can use the boost that this might offer (and can do the work) I hope you'll share this with them. Applications close on December 10th.","December 6, 2010","Publishing venture, internships, education program"
Living with doubt,"… is almost always more profitable than living with certainty.
People don't like doubt, so they pay money and give up opportunities to avoid it. Entrepreneurship is largely about living with doubt, as is creating just about any sort of art.

The world’s worst boss,"That would be you.
Even if you’re not self-employed, your boss is you. You manage your career, your day, your responses. You manage how you sell your services and your education and the way you talk to yourself.
Odds are, you’re doing it poorly.
If you had a manager that talked to you the way you talked to you, you’d quit. If you had a boss that wasted as much of your time as you do, they’d fire her. If an organization developed its employees as poorly as you are developing yourself, it would soon go under.
I’m amazed at how often people choose to fail when they go out on their own or when they end up in one of those rare jobs that encourages one to set an agenda and manage themselves. Faced with the freedom to excel, they falter and hesitate and stall and ultimately punt.
We are surprised when someone self-directed arrives on the scene. Someone who figures out a way to work from home and then turns that into a two-year journey, laptop in hand, as they explore the world while doing their job. We are shocked that someone uses evenings and weekends to get a second education or start a useful new side business. And we’re envious when we encounter someone who has managed to bootstrap themselves into happiness, as if that’s rare or even uncalled for.
There are few good books on being a good manager. Fewer still on managing yourself. It’s hard to think of a more essential thing to learn.","December 4, 2010","self-management, personal development, career management"
Cliches,"When you launch a new idea or project into the world, you'll probably use connections to what has come before as a way to tell your story.
Caribou Coffee, for example, uses all sorts of metaphors and cues and even verbaltropesthat we learned from Starbucks. These signals help us understand that the place we're about to enter isn't a steakhouse, isn't a shoeshine stand and isn't a massage parlor. It's a place to get a latte.
Books that want to be bestsellers work hard to look like previous bestsellers, from the store where they are sold to how many pages long they are to how much they cost. These signals help us determine that this object is something worth buying and reading.
Cable TV does this, politicans do this, computer resellers do this.
Here's the thing: you can't stand out if you fit in all the way, and thus the act of deciding which part isn't going to match is the important innovation.
Matching an elementalmostlooks like failure. Matchingnot-at-all, on the other hand, is the refreshing whack on the side of the head that causes attention to be paid.
When your car looks like a car but the doors are gullwing, we notice them. When your suit looks like a suit but the lining is orange, we notice it. When you apply for a job and you don't have a resume, we notice it.
This was the secret of the golden age of comic books. 90% of every hero was on key, professionally done, easy to understand… which allowed the remarkable parts to stand out.

The inevitable decline due to clutter,"Digital media expands. It's not like paper, it can get bigger.
As digital marketers seek to increase profits, they almost always make the same mistake. They continue to add more clutter, messaging and offers, because, hey, it's free.
One more link, one more banner, one more side deal on the Groupon page.
Economics tells us that the right thing to do is run the factory until the last item produced is being sold at marginal cost. In other words, keep adding until it doesn't work any more.
In fact, human behavior tells us that this is a more permanent effect than we realize. Once you overload the user, you train them not to pay attention. More clutter isn't free. In fact, more clutter is a permanent shift, a desensitization toallthe information, not just the last bit.

Who owns Wikipedia?,"You have probably noticed the big banner ads with Jimbo Wales' smiling face on them… they show up whenever you visit Wikipedia, the single most useful destination online.
The question: why are they there?
After all, if Wikipedia ran Google ads in the sidebar just three days a year, they'd pay for all of their operating expenses.
I haven't talked to Jimmy about this, but here's my guess, one that applies to other community-funded efforts: If the user supports it, she owns it. If support comes from anonymous government money, or some corporate sponsorship, then the interactions don't matter so much, and it's more distant from you.
I would bet that any charity or cause that gets involvement from its supporters (and I believe that volunteer support is worth more than cash) outperforms equally well-funded organizations that don't have as deep a connection.

How much time and effort should be spent on intake, on inbound messages, on absorbing data…
and how much time and effort should be invested in output, in creating something new.

Texting while working,"Yes, you shouldn't text while driving, or talk on the cell phone, or argue with your dog or drive blindfolded. It's an idiot move, one that often leads to death (yours or someone else's).
I don't think you should text while working, either. Or use social networking software of any kind for that matter. And you probably shouldn't eat crunchy chips, either.
I don't think there's anything wrong with doing all that at work (in moderation). But not while you'reworking. Not if working is that the act that leads to the scarce output, the hard stuff, the creative uniqueness they actually pay you for.
You're competing against people in a state of flow, people who are truly committed, people who care deeply about the outcome. You can't merely wing it and expect to keep up with them. Setting aside all the safety valves and pleasant distractions is the first way to send yourself the message that you're playing for keeps. After all, if you sit for an hour and do exactly nothing, not one thing, you'll be ashamed of yourself.

Bill James and you,"The guy who revolutionized baseball stats had a simple insight: past performance is a good indicator of future performance.
The stock market doesn't follow that rule, but an awful lot of human performance traits do.
The question one must ask before ignoring the past performance rule (if you're doing a job interview, say) is, ""what am I replacing the Bill James rule with?"" We need to understand how we're predicting the future if we're abandoning the idea of using the past as a guide.
If you believe that pleasant interviewing skills, a good handshake or the right outfit are a better predictor of future performance than what the person has actually shipped in the past, I think it's worth pointing out that you're nuts.
And if you're the one who's hoping to be interviewed one day, it seems as though the best way to market yourself isn't with a slick resume or the right suit. No, the most reliable form of self marketing is to have a long history of stunningly great work, shipped.
[Karen writes in to point out that many people break this rule, accomplishing something great right out of the box. And well they do. In fact, if you do it a few times, then, in Karen's words, ""I'll just keep breaking the Bill James Rule, until I become proof of it.""]","January 29, 2011","Bill James, past performance, job interview"
When was the last time you bought a tie?,"My guess is not lately.
When you first got a fancy job, you had a tie shortage, and thus attention was paid to ties. You bought ""enough for now."" Then you solved the tie problem and moved on.
When you first bought an iPhone, you had an app shortage, so attention was paid to apps. You bought ""enough for now."" Then you moved on.
Music might be an exception (buying a new stereo doesn't often lead to a new music binge). But in general, some external event occurs that creates a fissure, an opportunity, a problem. We search, we buy, we're done.
The challenge, then, is to develop products that match what the market is looking for, and more important, to overtly and aggressively seek out the people in that situation and ignore the rest. Which is precisely what most marketers large and small arenotdoing right now.
RELATED: Many marketers I know have a great idea for a product or service that will target a segment of the market that doesn't know to look for the great idea. For example, you might want to sell a better, easier to use hatchet for women. The problem is that women, long accustomed to never being able to find an axe that they're comfortable with, have given up looking, perhaps several generations ago.
Alerting a market segment that isn't looking is a thousand times harder than activating a segment that just can't wait for your arrival.

Why I don’t sell Kimchi,"Years ago, I put together a really cool plan to get into the artisinal kimchi business (with a tofu sideline, of course). What, you didn't know therewasan artisinal kimchi business?
Here's the first draft of our packaging (click the picture to see the engaging copy).
Why did I stop before I really started?
Because distribution can define your business. The distribution that book publishers offered me seemed more highly leveraged, approachable and yes, fun, than the idea of driving from bodega to deli, hawking my wares.
Just about every business is limited (and thus valued) by its distribution, by the way it is able to get paid for what it makes. Direct mail is different than a salesforce which is different than retailers… And while the food business attracts tons of enthusiastic people, the distribution challenges are significant.
On the other hand, once you overcome the distribution hurdle in a difficult environment, you have the market all to yourself. The dip that's in between you and the amateurs (the dip you got through, congratulations) gives you insulation and enables your business to thrive.

Click on your guess (just one, please):one,two,three,four,five.
Cynics have already become annoyed at me. But most people, particularly if I added a little spin, would be delighted at their sensitivity and psi-power.
The point: you can easily create similar interactions in the way you do business with people. Setting up prospects, customers and bosses to be right is almost always worth the effort. It's so much more useful than setting people up to fail.
Why then, do we organize interfaces, manuals, contracts and relationships to have people fail merely because they didn't guess what we had in mind? When in doubt, make it so people succeed.","January 26, 2011","delight, interaction, success"

Three ways to help people get things done,"A friend sent me a copy of a newbookabout basketball coachDon Meyer. Don was one of the most successful college basketball coaches of all time, apparently. It's quite a sad book—sad because of his tragic accident, but also sad because it's a vivid story about a misguided management technique.
Meyer's belief was that he could become an external compass and taskmaster to his players. By yelling louder, pushing harder and relentlessly riding his players, his plan was to generate excellence by bullying them. The hope was that over time, people would start pushing themselves, incorporating Don's voice inside their head, but in fact, this often turns out to be untrue. People can be pushed, but the minute you stop, they stop. If the habit you've taught is to achieve in order to avoid getting chewed out, once the chewing out stops, so does the achievement.
It might win basketball games, but it doesn't scale and it doesn't last. When Don left the room (or the players graduated), the team stopped winning.
A second way to manage people is to create competition. Pit people against one another and many of them will respond. Post all the grades on a test, with names, and watch people try to outdo each other next time. Promise a group of six managers that one of them will get promoted in six months and watch the energy level rise. Want to see little league players raise their game? Just let them know the playoffs are in two weeks and they're one game out of contention.
Again, there's human nature at work here, and this can work in the short run. The problem, of course, is that in every competition most competitors lose. Some people use that losing to try harder next time, but others merely give up. Worse, it's hard to create the cooperative environment that fosters creativity when everyone in the room knows that someone else is out to defeat them.
Both the first message (the bully with the heart of gold) and the second (creating scarce prizes) are based on a factory model, one of scarcity. It's my factory, my basketball, my gallery and I'm going to manipulate whatever I need to do to get the results I need. If there's only room for one winner, it seems these approaches make sense.
The third method, the one that I prefer, is toopen the door.Give people a platform, not a ceiling. Set expectations, not to manipulate but to encourage. And then get out of the way, helping when asked but not yelling from the back of the bus.
When people learn to embrace achievement, they get hooked on it. Take a look at the incredible achievements the alumni of some organizations achieve after they move on. When adults (and kids) see the power of self-direction and realize the benefits of mutual support, they tend to seek it out over and over again.
In a non-factory mindset, one where many people have the opportunity to use the platform (I count the web and most of the arts in this category), there are always achievers eager to take the opportunity. No, most people can't manage themselves well enough to excel in the way you need them to, certainly not immediately. But those that can (or those that can learn to) are able to produce amazing results, far better than we ever could have bullied them into. They turn into linchpins, solving problems you didn't even realize you had. A new generation of leaders is created…

Treat different customers differently,"This is difficult if you also insist on treating every customer the same. Or treating every customer the best, which is a better way to describe a similar idea.
No, the only way you can treat different customers differently is if you understand that their values (and their value to you) vary. It's easier than ever to discern and test these values, and you do everyone a service when you differentiate.","January 22, 2011","Customer differentiation, values, customer service"
Misjudging risk (and bad decisions),"The perception of risk is skewed when bad outcomes are vivid, personal and immediate.
Given the choice between working on the important and the urgent, the urgent almost always wins.
Given the choice between avoiding the rare but grisly outcome or doing the hard work to avoid the equally nasty, more subtle but more common outcome, we usually go for the grisly.
We do this sort of miscalculation all the time at work. We avoid the hard work on the long-term project in order to panic and rush about to avoid the possible vivid, immediate and personal risk on the short-term project, even if it's far less important.
(Think about this the next time you're in the security line at the airport).
This is one reason why the media is so complicit in many of the issues  of the day… they take concepts that were previously abstract and  relentlessly make them vivid, personal and immediate. It amplifies the  risks around us and easily sells us on a cycle of dissatisfaction.
If you want to create action on the important, figure out how to make itvivid, personal and immediate.","January 21, 2011","risk perception, decision-making, urgency"
Timing rewards,"We can agree that promising a three-year old a new car when he graduates from college is probably an ineffective way to get him to stop sucking his thumb.
As we mature, it gets easier to trade satisfaction now for a prize later. However, the more risk involved in getting the prize, the less we value it. Frequent flyer miles, for example, began with the promise that if you flew an airline regularly for months (or even years) you'd get a free flight. The airlines oversold the miles and undelivered on the free flights, though, so the reward started to lose its perceived value–too much risk that you wouldn't get the prize you wanted. Many of the frequent flyers I know have ceased to 'save up' and now use their miles for upgrades, moving the benefit closer in time.
One of the many things the web is changing is our focus onnow. It's increasing. Offering a reward in three months just isn't going to cut it. If you want me to get out of bed or brush my teeth or click on your link, there better be something waiting for me on the other side.","January 20, 2011","Timing rewards, instant gratification, perceived value"

Seth Godin: Permission Marketing –Buy the book here
THE MARKETING CRISIS THAT MONEY WON’T SOLVE
YOU’RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION. NOBODY IS.
It’s not your fault. It’s just physically impossible for you to pay attention to everything that marketers expect you to-like the 17,000 new grocery store products that were introduced last year, or the $1,000 worth of advertising that was directed exclusively at you last year.
Is it any wonder that consumers feel like the fast-moving world around them is getting blurry? There’s TV at the airport, advertisements in urinals, newsletters on virtually every topic, and a cellular phone wherever you go.
This is a book about the attention crisis in America and how marketers can survive and thrive in this harsh new environment. Smart marketers have discovered that the old way of advertising and selling products isn’t working as well as it used to, and they’re aggressively searching for a new, enterprising way to increase market share and profits. Permission Marketing is a fundamentally different way of thinking about advertising and customers.
I remember when I was about five years old and started watching television seriously. There were only three main channels-2, 4 and 7, plus a public channel and UHF channel for when you were feeling adventuresome. I used to watch Ultraman every day after school on channel 29.
With just five channels to choose from, I quickly memorized the TV schedule. I loved shows like The Munsters, and I also had a great time with the TV commercials. Charlie the Tuna, Tony the Tiger and those great board games that seemed to magically come alive all vied for my attention. And they got it.
Growing up, it seemed like everyone I met was part of the same community. We saw the same commercials, bought the same stuff, discussed the same TV shows. Marketing was in a groove – if you invented a decent product and put enough money into TV advertising you could be pretty sure you’d get shelf space in stores. And if the ads were any good at all, people bought the products.
About ten years ago, I realized that a sea change was taking place. I had long ago ceased to memorize the TV schedules, I was unable to keep up with all the magazines I felt I should be reading, and with new alternatives like Prodigy and a book superstore, I fell hopelessly behind in my absorption of media.
I found myself throwing away magazines unopened. I was no longer interested enough in what a telemarketer might say to hesitate before hanging up. I discovered that I could live without hearing every new Bob Dylan album and that while there were plenty of great restaurants in New York City, the ones near my house in the suburbs were just fine.
The clutter, as you know, has only gotten worse. Try counting how many marketing messages you encounter today. Don’t forget to include giant brand names on T-
shirts, the logos on your computer, the Microsoft start-up banner on your monitor, radio ads, TV ads, airport ads, billboards, bumper stickers and even the ads in your local paper.
For ninety years, marketers have relied on one form of advertising almost exclusively. I call it Interruption Marketing. Interruption, because the key to each and every ad is to interrupt what the viewers are doing in order to get them to think about something else.
Almost no one goes home eagerly anticipating junk mail in their mailbox. Almost no one reads People magazine for the ads. Almost no one looks forward to a three minute commercial interruption on Must See TV.
Advertising is not why we pay attention. Yet marketers must make us pay attention for the ads to work. If they don’t interrupt our train of thought by planting some sort of seed in our conscious or subconscious, the ads fail. Wasted money. If an ad falls in the forest and no one notices, there is no ad.
You can define advertising as the science of creating and placing media that interrupts the consumer and then gets him or her to take some action. That’s quite a lot to ask of thirty seconds of TV time or 25 square inches of the newspaper, but without interruption, there’s no chance for action, and without action, advertising flops.
As the marketplace for advertising gets more and more cluttered, it becomes increasingly difficult to interrupt the consumer. Imagine you’re in an empty airport, early in the morning. There’s hardly anyone there as you leisurely stroll towards your plane.
Suddenly, someone walks up to you and says, “Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to Gate 7?” Obviously, you weren’t hoping for, or expecting, someone to come up and ask this question, but since he looks nice enough and you’ve got a spare second, you interrupt your train of thought and point him on his way.
Now, imagine the same airport, but it’s three in the afternoon and you’re late for your flight. The terminal is crowded with people, all jostling for position. You’ve been approached five times by various faux charities on your way to the gate, and you’ve got a headache to top it all off.
Same guy comes up to you and asks the same question. Odds are, your response will be a little different. If you’re a New Yorker, you might ignore him altogether. Or you may stop what you were doing, say, “sorry,” and then move on.
A third scenario is even worse. What if he’s the fourth, or the tenth, or the one hundredth person who’s asked you the same question? Sooner or later you’re going to tune out the interruptions. Sooner or later, it all becomes background noise.
Well, your life is a lot like that airport scene. You’ve got too much to do and not enough time to get it done. You’re being accosted by strangers constantly. Every day, you’re exposed to more than four hours of media. Most of it is optimized to interrupt what you’re doing. And increasingly, it’s getting harder and harder to find a little peace and quiet.
The ironic thing is that marketers have responded to this problem with the single worst cure possible. To deal with the clutter and the diminished effectiveness of Interruption Marketing, they’re interrupting us even more!
That’s right. Over the last thirty years, advertisers have dramatically increased their ad spending. They’ve also increased the noise level of their ads-more jump cuts, more in-your-face techniques-and searched everywhere for new ways to interrupt your day.
Thirty years ago, clothing did not carry huge logos. Commercial breaks on television were short. Magazines rarely had three hundred pages of ads (as many computer magazines do today). You could even watch PBS without seeing several references to the “underwriter.”
As clutter has increased, advertisers have responded by increasing clutter. And as with pollution, because no one owns the problem, no one is working very hard to solve it.
In addition to clutter, there’s another problem facing marketers. Consumers don’t need to care as much as they used to. The quality of products has increased dramatically. It’s increased so much, in fact, that it doesn’t really matter which car you buy, which coffee maker you buy, or which shirt you buy. They’re all a great value and they’re all going to last a good long while.
We’ve also come a long way as consumers. Ninety years ago, it was unusual to find a lot of brand name products in a consumer’s house. Ninety years ago, we made stuff, we didn’t buy it. Today, however, we buy almost everything. Canned goods. Bread. Perked coffee. Even water. As a result, we already have a favorite brand of almost everything. If you like your favorite brand, why invest time in trying to figure out how to switch?
We’re not totally locked in, of course. It wasn’t too long ago that cake mix was a major innovation. Just a few years ago, we needed to make major decisions about which airline was going to be our supplier of frequent flyer miles. And today, if you’re going to get health care, you’ve got to make a serious choice. But more often than not, you’ve already made your decisions and you’re quite happy with them.
When was the last time someone launched a major new manufacturer of men’s suits? Or a large nationwide chain of department stores? Or a successful new nationwide airline? Or a fast food franchise? It can be done, certainly, but it doesn’t happen very often. One of the reasons it’s such a difficult task is that we’re pretty satisfied as consumers.
If the deluge of new products ceased tomorrow, almost no one would mind. How much more functional can a T-shirt get? Except for fast moving industries like computers, the brands we have today are good enough to last us for years and years. Because our needs as consumers are satisfied, we’ve stopped looking really hard for new solutions.
Yet, because of the huge profits that accrue to marketers who do invent a successful new brand, a new killer product, a new category, the consumer is deluged with messages. Because it’s not impossible to get you to switch from MCI to Sprint, or from United Airlines to American Airlines, or from Reebok to Nike, marketers keep trying. It’s estimated that the average consumer sees about one million marketing messages a year-about 3,000 a day.
That may seem like a lot, but one trip to the supermarket alone can expose you to more than 10,000 marketing messages! An hour of television might deliver 40 or more, while an issue of the newspaper might have as many as 100. Add to that all the logos, wallboards, junk mail, catalogues, and unsolicited phone calls you have to process every day and it’s pretty easy to hit that number. A hundred years ago, there wasn’t even a supermarket, there wasn’t a TV show, and there weren’t radio stations.
Technology and the marketplace have also brought the consumer a glut of ways to be exposed to advertising. When the FCC ruled the world of television, there were only three networks and a handful of independents. Networks made a fortune because they were the only game in town. Now there are dozens, and in some areas, hundreds of TV channels to choose from.
The final episode of Seinfeld made media headlines. Yet thirty years ago, Seinfeld’s ratings wouldn’t have made Neilsen’s list of top 25 shows of the season. With an almost infinite number of options, the chances of a broadcast, even a network broadcast, reaching almost everyone are close to zero.
Even worse is the World Wide Web. At last count, there were nearly 2,000,000 different commercial web sites. That means that there’s about 25 people online for every single website…hardly a mass market of interest to an interruption marketer.
Alta Vista, one of the most complete and most visited search engines on the internet, claims to have indexed 100 million pages. That means that their computer has surfed and scanned 100 million pages of information, and if you do a search, that’s the database you’re searching through.
It turns out that in response to people who do searches online, Alta Vista delivers about 900 million pages a month. That means that the average page that they have indexed in their search engine is called up exactly nine times a month. Imagine that. Millions of dollars invested in building snazzy corporate marketing sites and an average of nine people a month search for and find any given page of information on this search engine.
This is a very, very big haystack, and interruption marketers don’t have that many needles.
Marketers have invested (and almost completely wasted) more than a billion dollars on web sites as a way of cutting through the clutter. General Electric has a site with thousands of pages. Ziff-Davis offers a site with more than 250,000 pages! And a direct result of this attempt to cut through the clutter is the most cluttered, least effective marketing of all.
A quick look at the newsstand at Barnes & Noble will confirm that the problem of clutter saturation isn’t limited to electronic media. There are enough consumer magazines (ignoring the even larger category of trade magazines for a moment) to keep a reader busy reading magazines full time, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Obviously, the mass market is dying. The vast splintering of media means that a marketer can’t reach a significant percentage of the population with any single communication. That’s one reason the Super Bowl can charge so much for advertisements. Big events are unique in their ability to deliver about half the consumers watching TV, so they’re the perfect platform for Interruption Marketing aimed at the mass audience.
Other than buying even more traditional advertising, how are mass marketers dealing with this profound infoglut? They’re taking four approaches:
(1) First, they’re spending more in odd places. Not just on traditional TV ads, but a wide range of interesting and obscure media. Campbell’s Soup bought ads on parking meters. Macy’s spends a fortune on its parade. Kellogg’s has spent millions building a presence on the World Wide Web-a fascinating way to sell cereal.
Companies have seen that a mass market broadcast strategy isn’t working as well as it used to, especially when targeting the hard-to-reach upper income demographic. As this lucrative audience spends less time watching TV, marketers are working overtime trying to find media with less clutter, where their interruption techniques can be more effective.
Marketers hire Catalina Corporation to print their coupons on the back of receipts at the grocery store. They buy ads on the floor of the cereal aisle. There are ads atop taxis in New York City and on the boards around the rink at the hockey game. Fox even figured out a way to sell the rights to the small area over the catcher’s shoulder, so TV viewers would see the ad throughout an entire baseball game.
(2) The second technique is to make advertisements ever more controversial and entertaining. Coca-Cola hired talent agency CAA to enlist top-flight Hollywood directors to make commercials. Candies features a woman sitting on a toilet in its magazine ads (for shoes!). Spike Lee’s ad agency did more than fifty million dollars in billings last year.
Of course, as the commercials try harder to get your attention, the clutter becomes even worse. An advertiser who manages to top a competitor for the moment has merely raised the bar. Their next ad will have to be even more outlandish in order to top the competition, not to mention their previous ad, to keep the consumer’s attention.
The cost of making a first-rate TV commercial is actually far more, per minute, than a major Hollywood motion picture. Talking frogs, computer graphics and intense editing now seem to be a requirement.
A side effect of the focus on entertainment is that it gives the marketer far less time to actually market. In a fifteen second commercial (increasingly attractive as a cost-
cutting way to interrupt people even more often), ten or even twelve seconds are devoted to getting your attention, while just a few heartbeats are reserved for the logo, the benefit and the call to action.
Take the interruption challenge! Write down all the companies who ran commercials during your favorite TV show last night. Write down all the companies that paid good money to buy banners on the Web during your last surfing expedition. If you can list more than ten percent of them, you’re certainly the exception.
(3) The third approach used to keep mass marketing alive is to change ad campaigns more often in order to keep them “interesting and fresh.” Tony the Tiger and Charlie Tuna and the Marlboro man are each worth billions of dollars in brand equity to the companies that built them. The marketers behind them have invested a fortune over the last forty years, making them trusted spokesmen (or spokesanimals) for their brands.
Nike, on the other hand, just ran a series of ads without the swoosh, arguably one of the most effective logos of the last generation. Apple Computer changes its tagline annually. Wendy’s and McDonald’s and Burger King jump from one approach to the other, all hoping for a holy grail that captures attention.
In exchange for these brief bits of attention (remember the hoopla when they replaced Mikey on the Life box?) these marketers are trading in the benefits of a long term brand recognition campaign. It’s a trade they’re willing to make, because Interruption Marketing requires it. Without attention, there is no ad.
(4) The fourth and last approach, which is as profound as the other three, is that many marketers are abandoning advertising and replacing it with direct mail and promotions. Marketers now allocate about 52% of their annual ad budgets for direct mail and promotions, a significant increase over past years.
Of the more than $200 billion spent on consumer advertising last year in the US, more than $100 billion was spent on direct mail campaigns, in-store promotions, coupons, free standing inserts and other non-traditional media. Last year alone Wunderman, Cato, Johnson, did more than $1.6 billion in billings for its clients (folks like AT&T).
The next time you get a glossy mailing for a Lexus, or enter an instant win sweepstakes at the liquor store, you’re seeing the results of this trend toward increased direct marketing efforts. Advertisers are using them because they work. They are somewhat more effective at interrupting you than an ad. They’re somewhat more measurable than a billboard. Best of all, they give the marketer another tool to use in their increasingly frustrating fight against clutter. After all, there are only five or ten pieces of junk mail in your mailbox every day-not 3,000. And another few feet of shelf space at the supermarket can lead to a dramatic upturn in sales.
Even though they work better than advertising, these techniques are astonishingly wasteful. A 2% response for a direct mail campaign will earn the smart marketer a raise at most companies. But a 2% response means that the same campaign was trashed, ignored or rejected by an amazing 98% of the target audience! From the perspective of the marketer, however, if the campaign earns more than it costs, it’s worth doing again.
Of course, just as suburbanites learned when they fled the city to avoid the crowds, if a strategy works, other people will be right on your heels. That bucolic countryside rapidly fills up with other people looking to get away from it all. Correspondingly, as each of these promotional media becomes measurably effective, every smart marketer rushes to join in. Finding a unique approach that cuts through the clutter is usually very short lived.
Virtually every supermarket now charges a shelving allowance, for example, which manufacturers pay for if they want more shelf space for their products. Every liquor store is already jammed with promotions. Every mailbox in the country is brimming with catalogs for clothes, gardening equipment and fountain pens.
Direct marketers are responding to this glut by using computers. With access to vast amounts of computerized customer information, marketers can collate and cross-
reference a database of names to create a finely-tuned mailing list, and then send them highly targeted messages. For example, a direct marketer might discover that based on past results, the best prospects for its next campaign are single women who are registered Democrats, who make more than $58,000 a year and have no balance on their credit card. This information is easily available, and marketers are now racing to make their direct marketing ever more targeted.
Of course, database marketing is a weapon available to any marketer, so like all trends in Interruption Marketing, this one will soon lose its edge. When others jump in as well, the clutter will inevitably catch up.
The last frontier of Interruption Marketing appears to be exemplified by the movie Titanic. James Cameron showed the world that outspending any rational marketer will indeed cut through the clutter. Hollywood has jumped on this bandwagon with marketing campaigns for Godzilla and other films that at first glance, can’t possibly bring in enough ticket sales to justify the expense.
Nike uses the same approach to sell sneakers, and now this radical overspending strategy is being used by others, especially on the internet. The thinking behind it is based on an all or nothing roll of the dice. Basically, because clutter is so pervasive, anyone who can successfully break through and create a new mass market product will reap huge rewards. And betting vast amounts of other people’s money on that breakthrough is one way to play.
Of course, once there’s a proven pattern that big spending can win, others in the category will jump in as well. The bar will be raised yet again, and the only winners will be the media companies that sell the air time and ad space in the first place.
What about the ad agencies? With so many talented people, why aren’t they working to solve this problem?
Unfortunately, the clutter wars are taking their casualties at the agency side as well. The big agencies, the ones who could afford to take the lead in this challenge, are faced with three dismal problems:
(1) First, clients are giving the agencies a much shorter leash. Leo Burnett used to keep clients for twenty or thirty years. Levi’s stayed at FCB for 68 years. That’s so long that not one person at either company was probably born when the account work was started on Levi’s.
Today, however, it’s not unusual for a marketer to change agencies after two or three years. Companies that fired their ad agencies in the last year include Bank of America, Compaq, Goodyear, and many more.
(2) The second problem is that the stock market has been conducive to agency consolidations. The best way to make money in advertising today is to buy ad agencies and take them public. As a result, some of the best minds in the business have been focusing on building agencies, not brands.
(3) And last, the commission structure that every ad agency was built upon has been dramatically dismantled. Traditionally, agencies were paid by media companies. They got to keep 15% of all the ad money that the client spent on ad space in the form of a commission from the magazines and TV networks where they ran their ads. This meant that big clients could generate huge profits for the ad agencies, which funded work on new approaches to advertising as well as the innovative ads for new, smaller clients. But now the big guys have decided to put a stop to this subsidizing, and it’s rare to find an ad agency who still gets a straight 15% commission on media buys for their big clients.

To summarize the problem that faces the Interruption Marketer:
1.  Human beings have a finite amount of attention.
You can’t watch everything, remember everything, or do everything. As the amount of noise in your life increases, the percentage of messages that get through inevitably decreases.
2.  Human beings have a finite amount of money.
You also can’t buy everything. You have to choose. But because your attention is limited, you’ll only be able to choose from those things you notice.
3.  The more products offered, the less money there is to go around.
It’s a zero sum game. Every time you buy a Coke, you don’t buy a Pepsi. As the number of companies offering products increases, and as the number of products each company offers multiplies, it’s inevitable that there will be more losers than winners.
4.  In order to capture more attention and more money, Interruption Marketers must increase spending.

Spending less money than your competitors on advertising in a cluttered environment inevitably leads to decreased sales.
5.  But this increase in marketing exposure costs big money
Interruption marketers have no choice but to spend a bigger and bigger portion of their company’s budgets on breaking through the clutter.
6.  But, as you’ve seen, spending more and more money in order to get bigger returns leads to ever more clutter.
7.  Catch-22: The more they spend, the less it works. The less it works, the more they spend.

Is mass marketing due for a cataclysmic shakeout? Absolutely. A new form of marketing is changing the landscape, and it will affect interruption marketing as significantly as the automobile affected the makers of buggy whips.
PERMISSION MARKETING-THE WAY TO MAKE ADVERTISING WORK AGAIN

POWERFUL ADVERTISING IS ANTICIPATED, PERSONAL AND RELEVANT.   What if you could turn clutter into an asset? What if the tremendous barriers faced by Interruption Marketers actually became an advantage for you and your company? The truth is that even though clutter is bad and getting worse, Permission Marketers turn clutter to their advantage. In fact, the worse the clutter gets, the more profitable your Permission Marketing efforts become.
In this chapter, I’m going to outline the core ideas behind Permission Marketing. Every marketing campaign gets better when an element of permission is added. In some cases, a switch to marketing with Permission can fundamentally change a company’s entire business model and profit structure. At the very least, the basic concepts of Permission will help you formulate and launch every marketing campaign with greater insight and success.
Interruption marketing fails because it is unable to get enough attention from consumers. Permission Marketing works by taking advantage of the same problem – there just isn’t enough attention to go around.
Two hundred years ago, natural resources and raw materials were scarce. People needed land to grow food, metal to turn into pots, and silicates and other natural elements to make windows for houses. Tycoons who cornered the market in these and other resources made a fortune. By making a market in a scarce resource, you can make a profit.
With the birth of the industrial revolution, and the growth of our consumer economy, the resource scarcity shifted from raw materials to finished goods. Factories were at capacity. The great industrialists, like Carnegie and Ford, earned their millions by providing what the economy demanded. Marketers could call the shots, because other options were scarce.
Once factories caught up with demand, marketers developed brands that consumers would desire and pay a premium to own. People were willing to walk a mile for a Camel, and they’d rather fight than switch their brand of cigarette. When brands were new and impressive, owning the right brand was vital.
But in today’s free market, there are plenty of factories, plenty of brands and way too many choices. With just a little effort and a little savings, we can get almost anything we want. You can find a TV set in every house in this country. People throw away their broken microwave ovens instead of having them repaired.
This surplus situation, or abundance of goods, is especially clear when it comes to information and services. Making another copy of a software program or printing another CD costs almost nothing. Bookstores compete to offer 50,000, 100,000 or even 1,000,000 different books-each for less than $25. There’s a huge surplus of intellectual property and services out there.
Imagine a tropical island, populated by people with simple needs and plenty of resources. You won’t find a bustling economy there. That’s because you need two things in order to have an economy: people who want things, and a scarcity of things they want. Without scarcity, there’s no basis for an economy.
When there’s an abundance of any commodity, the value of that commodity plummets. If a commodity can be produced at will and costs little or nothing to create, it’s not likely to be scarce, either. That’s the situation with information and services today. They’re abundant and cheap. Information on the web, for example, is plentiful and free.
Software provides another example. The most popular web server is not made by Microsoft or Netscape. And it doesn’t cost $1,000 or $10,000. It’s called Apache, and it’s created by a loosely knit consortium of programmers and it’s is totally free. Free to download, free to use. As resources go, information is not scarce.
There is one critical resource, though, that is in chronically short supply. Bill Gates has just as much as you do. And even Warren Buffet can’t buy more. That scarce resource is TIME. And in light of today’s information glut, that means that there’s a vast shortage of ATTENTION.
This combined shortage of time and attention is unique to today’s information age. Consumers are now willing to pay handsomely to save time, while marketers are eager to pay bundles to get attention.
Interruption Marketing is the enemy of anyone trying to save time. By constantly interrupting what we are doing at any given moment, the marketer who interrupts us not only tends to fail at selling his product, but wastes our most coveted commodity, time. In the long run, therefore, Interruption Marketing is doomed as a mass marketing tool. The cost to the consumer is just too high.
The alternative is Permission Marketing, which offers the consumer an opportunity to volunteer to be marketed to. By only talking to volunteers, Permission Marketing guarantees that consumers pay more attention to the marketing message. It allows marketers to calmly and succinctly tell their story, without fear of being interrupted by competitors or Interruption Marketers. It serves both consumers and marketers in a symbiotic exchange.
Permission Marketing encourages consumers to participate in a long-term, interactive marketing campaign in which they are rewarded in some way for paying attention to increasingly relevant messages. Imagine your marketing message being read by 70% of the prospects you send it to (not 5% or even 1%). Then imagine that more than 35% respond. That’s what happens when you interact with your prospects one at a time, with individual messages, exchanged with their permission over time.
Permission marketing is anticipated, personal, relevant.
Anticipated-people look forward to hearing from you
Personal-the messages are directly related to the individual.
Relevant-the marketing is about something the prospect is interested in.
I know what you’re thinking. There’s a catch. If you have to personalize every customer message, that’s prohibitive. If you’re still thinking within the framework of traditional marketing, you’re right. But in today’s information age, targeting customers individually is not as difficult as it sounds. Permission Marketing takes the cost of interrupting the consumer and spreads it out, over not one message, but dozens of messages. And this leverage leads to substantial competitive advantages and profits. While your competition continues to interrupt strangers with mediocre results, your Permission Marketing campaign is turning strangers into friends and friends into customers.
The easiest way to contrast the Interruption Marketer with the Permission Marketer is with an analogy about getting married. It also serves to exemplify how sending multiple individualized messages over time works better than a single message, no matter how impressive that single message is.
The Interruption Marketer buys an extremely expensive suit. New shoes. Fashionable accessories. Then, working with the best databases and marketing strategists, selects the demographically ideal singles bar.
Walking into the singles bar, the Interruption Marketer marches up to the nearest person and proposes marriage. If turned down, the Marketer repeats this process on every person in the bar.
If the Marketer comes up empty-handed after spending the entire evening proposing, it is obvious that the blame should be placed on the suit and the shoes. The tailor is fired. The strategy expert who picked the bar is fired. And the Interruption Marketer tries again at a different singles bar.
If this sounds familiar, it should. It’s the way most large marketers look at the world. They hire an agency. They build fancy ads. They “research” the ideal place to run the ads. They interrupt people and hope that one in a hundred will go ahead and buy something. And then, when they fail, they fire their agency!
The other way to get married is a lot more fun, a lot more rational, and a lot more successful. It’s called dating.
A Permission Marketer goes on a date. If it goes well, the two of them go on another date. And then another. Until, after ten or twelve dates, both sides can really communicate with each other about their needs and desires. After twenty dates, they meet each other’s families. And finally, after three or four months of dating, the Permission Marketer proposes marriage.
Permission Marketing is just like dating. It turns strangers into friends and friends into lifetime customers. Many of the rules of dating apply, and so do many of the benefits.
Every marketer must offer the prospective customer an incentive for volunteering. In the vernacular of dating, that means you have to offer something that makes it interesting enough to go out on a first date. A first date, after all, represents a big investment in time, money and ego. So there better be reason enough to volunteer.
Without a selfish reason to continue dating, your new potential customer (and your new potential date) will refuse you a second chance. If you don’t provide a benefit to the consumer for paying attention, your offer will suffer the same fate as every other ad campaign that’s vying for their attention. It will be ignored.
The incentive you offer to the customer can range from information, to entertainment, to a sweepstakes, to outright payment for the prospect’s attention. But the incentive must be overt, obvious and clearly delivered.
This is the most obvious difference between Permission Marketing and Interruption Marketing. Interruption Marketers spend all of their time interrupting strangers, in an almost pitiful attempt to bolster popularity and capture attention. Permission Marketers spend as little time and money talking to strangers as they can. Instead, they move as quickly as they can to turn strangers into prospects who choose to “opt-in” to a series of communications.
Second, using the attention offered by the consumer, the marketer offers a curriculum over time, teaching the consumer about the product or service he has to offer. The Permission Marketer knows that the first date is an opportunity to sell the other person on a second date. Every step along the way has to be interesting, useful and relevant.
Since the prospect has agreed to pay attention, it’s much easier to teach them about your product. Instead of filling each ensuing message with entertainment designed to attract attention, or with sizzle designed to attract the attention of strangers, the Permission Marketer is able to focus on product benefits—on specific, focused ways this product will help that prospect. Without question, this ability to talk freely over time is the most powerful element of this marketing approach.
The third step involves reinforcing the incentive. Over time, any incentive wears out. Just as your date may tire of even the finest restaurant, the prospective customer may show fatigue with the same repeated incentive. The Permission Marketer must work to reinforce the incentive, to be sure that the attention continues. This is surprisingly easy. Because this is a two-way dialogue, not a narcissistic monologue, the marketer can adjust the incentives being offered and fine tune them for each prospect.
Along with reinforcing the incentive, the fourth step is to increase the level of permission the marketer receives from the potential customer. Now I won’t go into detail on what step of the dating process this corresponds to, but in marketing terms, the goal is to motivate the consumer to give more and more permission over time. Permission to gather more data about the customer’s personal life, or hobbies, or interests. Permission to offer a new category of product for the customer’s consideration. Permission to provide a product sample. The range of permission you can obtain from a customer is very wide, and limited only by its relevance to the customer.
Over time, the marketer uses the permission he’s obtained to change consumer behavior, that is, get them to say, “I do.” That’s how you turn permission into profits. After permission is granted, that’s how it becomes a truly significant asset for the marketer. Now you can live happily ever after by repeating the aforementioned process while selling your customer more and more products. In other words, the fifth and final step is to leverage your permission into a profitable situation for both of you. Remember, you have access to the most valuable thing a customer can offer – attention.

Five Steps to Dating Your Customer
1.  Offer the prospect an incentive to volunteer
2.  Using the attention offered by the prospect, offer a curriculum over time, teaching the consumer about your product or service
3.  Reinforce the incentive to guarantee that the prospect maintains the permission
4.  Offer additional incentives to get even more permission from the consumer
5.  Over time, leverage the permission to change consumer behavior towards profits

Nothing good is free, and that goes double for Permission. Acquiring solid, deep permission from targeted customers is an investment.
What is one permission worth? According to their annual report, AOL has paid as much as $300 to get one new customer. American Express invests nearly $150 to get a new cardholder. Does American Express earn enough in fees to justify this expense? Not at all. But the other benefits associated with acquiring the permission to market to a cardmember outweigh the high cost. Amex sells its customers a wide range of products, not just an American Express card. They also use sophisticated database management tools to track customer behavior so they can tailor offers to individuals. They leverage their permission to increase revenue.
One of the leading brokerage houses on Wall Street is currently paying $15 in media acquisition costs just for permission to call a potential customer on the phone! Yes, it’s that expensive, and yes, it’s worth even more than that. They’ve discovered that the yield from an anticipated, welcomed, personal phone call is so much higher than a cold call during dinner that they’re willing to pay handsomely for the privilege.
While these (and other) marketers have discovered the power of permission, many interruption marketers have found, to their chagrin, that the cost of generating one new customer is rapidly approaching the net present value of that consumer. In other words, they’re close to losing money on every customer so they try to make it up in volume.
Permission Marketing cuts through the clutter and allows a marketer to speak to prospects as friends, not strangers. This personalized, anticipated, frequent, and relevant communication has infinitely more impact than a random message displayed in a random place at a random moment.
Think about choosing a nice restaurant for dinner. If you learn about a restaurant from a cold-calling telemarketer, or from an unsolicited direct mail piece, you’re likely to ignore the recommendation. But if a trusted friend offers a restaurant recommendation, you’re likely to try it out.
Permission Marketing lets you turn strangers, folks that might otherwise ignore your unsolicited offer, into people willing to pay attention when your message arrives in an expected, appreciated way.
An interruption marketer looks for a job by sending a resume to one thousand strangers. A Permission Marketer gets a job by focusing on one company and networking with them, consulting for them, working with them until they trust him enough to offer him a full time position..
A book publisher who uses interruption marketing sells children’s books by shipping them to bookstores, hoping that the right audience will stumble across them. A Permission Marketer builds book clubs at every school in the country.
An interruption marketer sells a new product by introducing it on national TV. A Permission Marketer sells a new product by informing all her existing customers about a way to get a free sample.

Permission Marketing isn’t as glamorous as hiring Steven Spielberg to direct a commercial starring a bevy of supermodels. It isn’t as easy as running an ad a few more times. It isn’t as cheap as building a web site and hoping that people find it on a search engine. In fact, it’s hard work.
Worst of all, Permission Marketing requires patience. Permission Marketing campaigns grow over time-the opposite of what most marketers look for these days. And Permission Marketing requires a leap of faith. Even a bad Interruption campaign gets some results right away, while a permission campaign requires infrastructure, and a belief in the durability of the permission concept before it blossoms with success..
But unlike Interruption Marketing, Permission Marketing is a measurable process. It evolves over time for every company that uses it. It becomes an increasingly valuable asset. The more you commit to Permission Marketing campaigns, the better they work over time. And these fast-moving, leveragable processes are the key to success in our cluttered age.
So, if Permission Marketing is so effective, and the ideas behind it not really new, why was the concept not used with effectiveness years ago? Why was this book just published?
Permission Marketing has been around forever (or at least as long as dating!), but it takes advantage of new technology better than other forms of marketing. The internet is the greatest direct mail medium of all time, and the low cost of frequent interaction makes it ideal for Permission Marketing.
Originally, the internet captured the attention of interruption marketers. They rushed in, spent billions of dollars applying their interruption marketing techniques and discovered almost total failure. Permission Marketing is the tool that unlocks the power of the internet. The leverage it brings to this new medium, combined with the pervasive clutter that infects the internet and virtually every other medium, makes Permission Marketing the most powerful trend in marketing for the next decade.
As new forms of media develop and clutter becomes ever more intense, it’s the asset of permission that will generate profits for marketers.
THE EVOLUTION OF MASS ADVERTISING
MASS ADVERTISING CREATED MASS MARKETERS

One hundred years ago, small companies ruled the earth. Virtually every retail dollar went to a small, individually owned business. Local businesses were responsive, trusted and capable. They had the infrastructure to deal with clients who didn’t have credit cards, telephones or Federal Express account numbers.
Without a mass communication infrastructure or the technology to expand, businesses stayed small and local. It was impossible for them to imagine a nationwide advertising campaign. New customers were acquired one at a time, usually by word of mouth or by door-to-door canvassing.
Companies knew exactly what a new client was worth, and they acted accordingly. A proprietor would spend hours with a prospect, knowing that the individual interaction would pay off many times over.
Consumers responded to this personal care and developed the expectation that they would be sold to personally. The local bookseller would read a book before recommending it. The local cheese merchant would happily offer a taste of a new flavor to a customer. It wasn’t unusual for a shopkeeper to spend some extra time with a customer, old or new, or for the merchant’s supplier to also be his neighbor. GIANT BRANDS GAVE RISE TO INTERRUPTIBLE MEDIA Giant brands and multi-national companies were created as the result of several interconnected socio-technological changes that occurred simultaneously.
The first change was the industrial revolution. Without the economies of scale that came from building factories, there was no reason at all to get big. When everything was handmade, having more craftsmen didn’t make your business more efficient or lucrative.
Once there were economies, though, businesses faced a choice. They could grow or they could wither. Many entrepreneurs saw the opportunity that came from scaling their businesses and raised the money to do just that.
Second, the development of the car and the truck made it possible to deliver things that were made more than a few miles away. Suddenly, companies could buy things in bulk, manufacture many items and then ship them around the country, and even around the world.
As a result of these investments, companies needed mass advertising. It did no good to build a factory that was efficient at mass production if it was impossible to deliver those goods to a larger market. And you couldn’t do that if you couldn’t persuade consumers to buy them. Instead of relying solely on word of mouth and personalized sales, big companies had no choice but to discover a way to get lots and lots of people to buy the output of their factories.
The big surprise is that it wasn’t factories or the car that caused the big increase in corporate profitability. It was advertising. The economies that came from establishing a product as the leading brand, the huge premiums that were derived by charging extra for a trusted name, dwarfed the savings in production.
Marketing rapidly became the most profitable part of the enterprise. In the words of one pundit, “everything else is an expense.” The ability to attract large numbers of customers with advertising was a revelation to these new companies. First enamored and then addicted, they based their entire business model and organization around the ability to reach the masses.
In the 1920s, advertising men were considered the saviors of industrialized society, the sophisticated men who would harness the awesome power of the crowd to uplift society. Advertising was credited with bringing the clean, the pure, and the powerful to ordinary citizens, lowering prices and vastly increasing the direct responsibility that manufacturers had over their products.
Once manufacturers began to advertise, they discovered (some quite by accident) an extraordinary truth: the more they advertised, the more sales they gained. And the value of the sales exceeded the cost of the advertising! The perpetual motion machine of commerce had arrived.
The development of content-filled media to hold all this advertising was a direct consequence of this discovery. Interruption Marketers needed something to interrupt, so newspapers flourished and magazines were started by the thousands. Did interruption marketing lead to the creation of mass media as we know it? Absolutely!
This evolution is best summarized by the story of Crisco.
In 1900, the folks at Procter & Gamble were heady with the success of Ivory soap. Ivory was the first packaged, branded soap that was able to compete with handmade soap, or unpackaged, bulk soap from the local general store. It was an insanely profitable, fast-growing business for this young company, but Ivory’s success quickly brought about a problem. There was a limited supply of cottonseed oil, a major ingredient in the manufacture of Ivory.
Cottonseed oil was produced by just a few tightly controlled trusts, and three huge vendors were able to purchase virtually all of the oil on the market. P&G desperately needed a product that would use lots of cottonseed oil. This increased consumption would give P&G more clout and lead to more reliable supplies and better pricing.
For four years, researchers worked to create the ideal product that would use a lot of cottonseed oil. Eventually, they created Crisco, a product designed to replace lard just as Ivory had replaced homemade soap.
In 1908 when P&G introduced Crisco, there was no Time Magazine, and no General Hospital on which to advertise. Without reliable mass media, P&G relied on permission marketing.
They started by paying the train lines (the equivalent of today’s airlines) to use Crisco instead of lard in the pies they served onboard (and to inform their customers when it was served). They secured testimonials from doctors and even rabbis, one of whom said that Crisco was, “The greatest advance for Judaism in 4,000 years.”
P&G held society teas in all the major cities, asking a leading citizen to invite the leading ladies to attend. Of course, everything offered to go with the tea was baked with Crisco.
Finally, P&G introduced a series of free cookbooks. In a classic Permission Marketing technique, P&G didn’t try to sell the product. Instead, they promoted the free cookbook. Once a prospect raised her hand for this information, the stories inside the cookbook taught her about the benefits of the product. The book quickly became a “bestseller.”
The campaign succeeded. Crisco rapidly became a major profit center for P&G. It also impacted grocery stores and changed the way people cooked.
But once the ball began rolling, Crisco realized that Permission Marketing alone couldn’t expand the brand’s popularity fast enough. So they took advantage of the lack of clutter and switched gears to an Interruption Marketing campaign. Now that they had a sales base, they wanted to expand it, fast. So they began buying advertising anywhere they could find it. And because there was so little clutter, the advertising popularized the brand quickly and cheaply.
Once the corporate world caught a glimpse of mass brand advertising, mass marketers were hooked on Interruption Marketing. The reasons were simple:
o Interruption Marketing was easy. Build a few ads, run them everywhere.  o Interruption Marketing was scaleable. If you need more sales, buy more ads.  o Interruption Marketing was predictable. With experience, a mass marketer could tell how many dollars in revenue one more dollar in ad spending would generate.
o Interruption Marketing fit the command and control bias of big companies. It was totally controlled by the advertiser, with no weird side effects.
o Interruption Marketing was profitable. The right product generated more profit than it cost the company to advertise.
Mass marketers optimized their organizations for this approach. They created brand managers and advertising agencies and measurement companies and focus groups and a myriad of other techniques to institutionalize their attachment to Interruption Marketing.
This focus on Interruption Marketing allowed the big brands to become even bigger and more dominant. The top 100 advertisers account for more than 87% of all advertising expenditures in this country. And more than 80 of these companies have been advertising for more than twenty years.
This has two important implications. First, behavior by these top advertisers dictates and drives the market as a whole. Second, and more important, is the fact that there are virtually no first generation marketers working at these companies.
To put it bluntly, big companies don’t hire people to reinvent their already successful marketing techniques. Instead, they hire and train people to do exactly what the last advertising people did. They market Crisco the same way they did 80 years ago. The Rice Krispies box hasn’t changed in years. Ford uses a marketing and distribution network they built in 1920.
Second and third generation marketers don’t want to rock the boat in which they’re sailing. They may have noticed that their current marketing techniques don’t seem to work as well as they used to, but they weren’t hired to demolish the distribution channel or to question the very foundation of their marketing heritage.
Permission Marketing represents a huge threat as well as a huge opportunity. Just as the fax machine altered the landscape of courier services and Federal Express, Permission Marketing will change the way companies market products.
Many of the big companies will stick to their knitting and remain faithful to the marketing methods that got them to where they are today. This creates mammoth opportunities for new companies, for companies with nothing to lose, for companies with the flexibility and initiative to try a very different way of gaining and keeping customers.

GETTING STARTED-FOCUS ON SHARE OF CUSTOMER, NOT MARKET SHARE
FIRE 70% OF YOUR CUSTOMERS AND WATCH YOUR PROFITS GO UP!

Five years ago, Don Peppers and Martha Rogers wrote a book that changed the marketing landscape forever. Titled The One to One Future, they proposed a radical rethinking of the way marketers treat their customers.
Peppers and Rogers presented a manifesto for how companies can increase their profits by selling more things to fewer customers. In other words, they believe it’s wiser to focus more on increasing sales to a smaller percentage of your existing customers than it is to find new ones.
The thinking behind their book is straightforward and it led directly to the agenda behind Permission Marketing: Getting a new customer is expensive. It takes money to get his attention and it takes continuing effort to educate him (interruption marketing is expensive, and so is the process of winning a customer’s trust). It’s also expensive for the customer, who has to spend time evaluating and learning about the features and benefits of a product.
So, argue the authors, instead of focusing on how to maximize the number of new customers, the focus should be on keeping customers longer and getting far more money from each of them over time.
It’s back to the old days, when merchants had a limited supply of customers and worked to get the maximum revenue from each one. Except now, with technology, companies can combine this old world thinking with the ability to dramatically grow their customer base at the same time.
If AT&T spends hundreds of dollars to get a new long distance customer, and that customer pays just $20 per month for AT&T’s services, then they have to be figuring out other ways to generate revenue through their interaction with that customer, not spending all their energy getting yet another new customer.
By selling cellular phone services, home security services and an increasing array of other items, AT&T can recoup the expense of obtaining these customers.
Levi’s has built the single largest brand of women’s jeans in the country. And they’ve done so without having any jeans in the store.
Instead, women have their measurements taken by a trained specialist, who sends them to a computerized factory. There, a semi-custom pair of jeans is made to order.
The shopper gets custom fit for a fraction of the cost.
Levi’s has a huge savings in inventory risk and advertising costs. And best of all, once a customer has given her measurements to Levi’s, once she’s endured the hassle of all that measurement-taking, once she’s worn a pair of custom jeans, would she even consider switching brands to save a few dollars?
To elaborate a little more on the one to one marketing approach, Peppers and Rogers would like you to focus on four things when selling to customers:
1.  Increase your “share of wallet.” Figure out which needs you can satisfy, then use the knowledge you have, and the trust you’ve built, to make that additional sale.
2.  Increase the durability of customer relationships. Invest money in customer retention, because it’s a small fraction of the cost of customer acquisition.
3.  Increase your product offerings to customers.

By being customer-focused instead of retail-focused, or factory-focused, a manufacturer or merchant can widely increase its offerings, thus increasing share of wallet.
4.  Create an interactive relationship that leads to meeting more customer needs. It’s a cycle. By constantly incenting the consumer to give more information, the marketer can offer more products.

This series of techniques isn’t easy, nor is it free. If it was, everyone would do it. It requires a huge investment in scaleable technology, along with the focus and commitment to do it right. It puts a lot more pressure on your organization, as well, because as each customer becomes worth more, the cost of losing one increases.
Don Peppers and Martha Rogers opened the eyes of many marketers and got them to look downstream after the first sale was made. By recognizing the huge cost of getting a first sale and the very high lifetime value of a customer, the one to one philosophy can dramatically increase profitability.
Permission Marketing demands that in addition to looking downstream, marketers now look upstream. The challenge facing most companies is that they notice people too late.
The process of getting new customers needs to be reengineered. Like caterpillars turning into butterflies, prospects go through a five step cycle:
Strangers
Friends
Customers
Loyal Customers
Former Customers
Today, most marketers don’t notice, track or interact with people until they are a customer. And some don’t even pay close attention until the consumer becomes a loyal customer. Unfortunately, a few don’t notice their customers until they become disgruntled former customers.
It’s essential, given the high cost of talking to strangers, that marketers move their focus of attention up the stream. They need to have a process in place that nurtures total strangers from the moment they first indicate an interest.
At that moment, a suite of marketing messages must begin to be applied. The goal is to teach, cajole and encourage this stranger to become a friend. And once she becomes a friend, to apply enough focused marketing to create a customer.
Do you know how your company does this now? Most marketers have no idea. They rely on a hodgepodge of randomly delivered interruptions and hope that from this primordial soup will rise a fully formed customer.
Computers and Permission Marketing can change that.
You can now choose who you reach. When you reach them. The order of the messages. The benefits offered.
You can create dozens or even hundreds of paths for an individual to follow from the first contact until the highest level of permission is granted.
If the marketing messages you send are anticipated, relevant and personal, they will cut through the clutter and increase the prospect’s knowledge of the benefits you offer. An organization that is focused on this process early on will always outperform one that isn’t.
As you’ve seen, Permission Marketing is the cousin of one to one marketing. Where Peppers and Rogers begin the process with the first sale, Permission begins the process with the very first contact.
Permission Marketing works to turn strangers into friends and then friends into customers. One to one marketing uses the very same techniques, incorporating knowledge, frequency, and relevance, to turn customers into supercustomers. One to one doesn’t compete with Permission Marketing. It’s part of the very same continuum. The one to one marketer takes the permission that’s been granted after someone becomes a customer and uses that permission to create even better customers.
The better the permission, the more profit created.

The one to one marketer works to change his focus from finding as many new customers as he can to extracting the maximum value from each customer.
The Permission marketer works to change his focus from finding as many prospects as he can to converting the largest number of prospects into customers. And then he leverages the permission on an ongoing basis.

You can’t build a one to one relationship with a customer unless the customer explicitly agrees to the process.
Everything from discovering a shoe size to building mutually dependent computer systems with a major vendor requires an overt agreement from both sides.
By measuring the depth of permission you have with each customer (one may allow you to send merchandise “on approval”, another may let you call them when a new product comes in), you can begin to track the benefits of your investment in Permission Marketing. By focusing on how deep your permission is with your existing customers, you can begin to recognize the value of your permission asset.
Frank Britt and Tim DeMello run a company called Streamline that is at the vanguard of the junction between Permission Marketing and one to one marketing.
Streamline capitalizes on the technologies and social shifts that are changing our lives, and they are building a fantastic business that serves as a model for the future.
They offer to save customers hours and hours of time each week by doing virtually all of their routine errands.
A call to Streamline leads to a customized sales pitch by a trained Streamline sales rep. And in a surprisingly high number of cases, that sales pitch leads to a first sale. Then Streamline comes to your house and installs a large wooden box and a refrigerator in your garage. Next, they ask to come into your house so they can scan the UPC codes on every item in your fridge and food cabinet. They take down the name of your pharmacy and where you like your clothes dry cleaned. Talk about Permission!
Then, using the Web, you log on each week and tell Streamline what you need. You fill out a pre-automated shopping list. They pick up dry cleaning and prescriptions and photos as well. Then, while you’re at work, they do all your errands, pick up what you need, and drop it off at your house.
Streamline does this for about $30 a month. And the more services they offer, the more permission they get from customers. In a single year, the average customer places 47 orders and spends more than $5,000 with them.
Multiply that by millions of potential customers and you see the size of the opportunity! As the company gains more permission, it’s not hard to imagine them branching into house cleaning, house painting, gardening and a huge range of home care and home delivery services.
By “owning” permission to market new services, and by using one to one techniques to know and remember your preferences, Streamline is creating a mega-business for the next century. They’re building an asset that has nothing to do with brand and everything to do with their relationship with you.
Will Streamline find competition? Without a doubt. But once they’ve established permission with their customers, it will be extremely difficult for a competitor to dislodge them.
A more familiar example is Amazon.com. Ask most sentient humans and they’ll tell you Amazon is a bookstore on the Web. Analysts will tell you that they’re one of the biggest internet-first brands.
Yet if Amazon is determined to be a bookseller, they’ve got big troubles. First, they pay far more for books than Barnes & Noble because of their smaller scale. But even if they overcome that disadvantage, other online sellers, like the new online service from Bertelsmann (the largest publisher of books in the world), will doubtless be able to compete on price.
So why is Amazon so busy building its customer base, losing money on each customer and trying to make it up in volume? Why does their prospectus claim that they’re losing money and see no end in sight for the losses?
Amazon appears to be building a permission asset, not a brand asset. Amazon has overt permission to track which books you buy and which books you browse. They have explicit permission to send you promotional e-mail messages. They are building special interest communities in which Amazon and its customers will be able to talk with each other about specific genres of books. Why?
The payoff comes the day Amazon decides to publish books. This is where the profit lies and where Amazon is best able to leverage their permission asset.
A book costs about $2 to print and $20 in the store. A huge gulf! But most of that money disappears in advertising, shipping and especially in the shredding of unsold books. What if you could remove all of those?
Imagine that Amazon.com sends a note to each of the one million people who bought a mystery novel from their site last year. (It costs them nothing to do that, of course, since e-mail is free). In the note, they ask if you’d like to buy the next Robert B. Parker novel, a Spenser mystery, which will be available exclusively from Amazon. And let’s say a third of those customers respond and say, “sure.”
Now, Amazon can make the following extraordinary offer to Robert B. Parker. “Write the book. We’ll edit it and typeset it and ship it directly to the 333,000 people who have pre-ordered it. We’ll deduct our costs and still have a million dollars left over to pay you.”
That’s a lot of money for a mystery novel. And yet Amazon still will earn more than 4 million dollars in profit from just one book.
Multiply that scenario by 100 or 1,000 books a year.
Using permission, Amazon can fundamentally reconfigure the entire book industry, disintermediating and combining every step of the chain until there are only two: the writer and Amazon.
That’s the way to visualize the power of Permission.
Technology enables marketers to have a perfect memory, and provides them with the ability to customize correspondence on the fly and deliver it for free via e-mail. Combine that with a database of customers who expect to receive marketing messages from you because they gave you their permission, and most industry book chains should begin to see a looming threat.
By moving strangers up the permission ladder, from that very first interruption until the moment when the consumer gives you the permission to actually purchase products on their behalf, marketers are able to optimize their entire marketing process. The results can be fantastic. By dramatically increasing the measurability and efficiency of your marketing system, your company can multiply its profits.
Traditional sales and marketing involves increasing market share, which means selling as much of your product as you can to as many customers as possible.
One to one marketing involves driving for share of customer, which means ensuring that each individual customer who buys your product buys more product, buys only your brand, and is happy using your product instead of another to solve their problem. The true, current value of any one customer is a function of the customer’s future purchases, across all the product lines, brands and services offered by you.

When you have a constant stream of strangers walking through the door as a result of Interruption Marketing, you don’t have to worry as much about protecting your existing customers. Even though it’s more profitable to cater to those existing customers, many marketers are uncomfortable with the shift in power it portends.
An online e-commerce story makes that lesson very clear.
A consumer ordered several items from a small merchant selling CDs online. The consumer’s credit card was quickly charged, but after three weeks, nothing had arrived.
The consumer sent a polite note to the customer service e-mail address. No response. Another note. No response.
So, after four weeks, the consumer wrote to the President of the company.
He wrote back the next day. His note consisted of just three words: “Get a Life.”
Did he burn a customer? Of course. That was his intention. But what he hasn’t learned yet (and soon will, or he’ll be gone) is that the act of dismissing that customer didn’t cost him just one sale. It cost him the loss of permission to sell products to this woman for the rest of her life.
Think about it. He had her in a dialogue. He had her credit card number. He knows what CDs she likes. If he had treated that permission with respect, it could have easily led to $1,000 or $5,000 worth of CD sales over the lifetime of the relationship. But because the merchant was a physical retailer, accustomed to the anonymity and unpredictability of walk-in trade, he figured he was losing a $10 sale. Big mistake.
Compare this to the true story of a similar customer at a similar merchant, also online. This time, the complaint about slow delivery ended when it reached the customer service desk. The customer got a response within five minutes. The response was factual (the CD was misaddressed and had been returned) but the letter was apologetic. AND the e-mail announced that to make up for the inconvenience, another CD by the same artist was going to be sent along for free.
Which merchant is most likely to earn a few thousand more dollars in incremental business due to the level of Permission earned? Customer service has always mattered. But now that power has shifted to the consumer, it matters a great deal more.
Based on these stories, however, there’s no way to know what type of customer, or future revenues, she represented. But given our vastly improved ability to “know” customers at an individual level, it’s important to recognize that some customers carry a negative value, and it’s sometimes wise to get rid of them. The reward comes to the marketer in the form of an increased ability to concentrate on nurturing the customers who represent the quality permission candidates for future business.
This means that sometimes you have to endure the entrepreneur’s nightmare—you must fire a customer. In view of optimizing customer service, sometimes that’s what it takes. A customer that distracts you, or one that cherry picks your line of products, or one that requires a disproportionate percentage of your company’s time and resources, for example, is going to cost you money. Of course it matters how you fire a customer, too, and telling a customer with a valid complaint to “get a life” obviously falls short of wisdom.
Not surprisingly, the first question most interruption marketers ask when they hear about Permission Marketing is, “How do you get people to sign up?”
Because they were trained in the art of getting momentary reactions from large numbers of people, this part of the process is the most familiar to them.
Permission Marketing almost always follows the same simple steps. Each campaign is very different, but the concepts behind each step remain the same. Simply stated, you interrupt the customer with a message designed to get them to raise their hand. That’s the way they volunteer, or say “yes” to begin a rewarding exchange of information accomplished over time, which builds trust that you can leverage into a sales relationship.
But the first step is still to interrupt the consumer. That’s one reason there will always be socially acceptable interruption marketing media. We need to get that initial attention.
Sometimes you’re lucky enough that a stranger comes to you of his own accord. There will always be a few people who straggle onto your web site, for example, or potential customers who call your toll free number or walk into your store. These are the freebies. Most of the time, however, you’ve got to use the tried and true interruptive techniques to reach large numbers of people.
Using measurable techniques, marketers can choose television, radio, print, direct mail or electronic media to grab the attention of consumers. But without some way to grab the attention of a stranger, the permission process never starts.
Joanne Kates is the third generation owner of Camp Arowhon, the oldest coed summer camp in North America. With a 70 year history, great word of mouth and a solid backlist, acquiring new customers is not her highest priority. Nonetheless, Arowhon needs a process to turn strangers into campers.
The camp uses permission marketing to accomplish this.
The first step is to advertise at camp fairs and in magazines that feature groups of ads from summer camps. But unlike virtually all of her competitors, Joanne isn’t trying to sell her camp. She knows that no one chooses a summer camp for their children on the basis of a two-inch square black and white advertisement.
Instead, her only goal in the ad, and at the trade show, is to get permission to send a video and a brochure. The ad sells the brochure, not the camp. Call the camp’s number and her staff will immediately qualify your interest and then send a video (perhaps the best produced camp video in the market) and the brochure (also extremely well-done.)
The only goal of the video is to get permission to have a personal meeting. It doesn’t sell the camp. It sells the meeting.
Now, fully qualified, and having seen the testimonials, the photographs, the facilities and the happy campers, the family is ready to be sold on the camp. And that’s done in person.
Once a camper attends for a summer, odds are that he or she will stay for more summers and bring a brother or sister as well. Which makes the sale worth nearly $20,000. By using Permission Marketing, Arowhon is able to make these significant step-by-step sales, with a very high efficiency.
At each step, the only goal of the next step is to expand permission. She interrupts to get permission to send a video using a small print ad, she uses the video to get permission to visit, she uses the visit to get permission to sell one summer and she uses the summer to sell six more.
By focusing media on getting permission instead of making the ultimate sale, marketers are able to get far more out of their expenditures. The response rate to a free sample or an affinity program or a birthday club might be five or ten times the response rate of an ad asking for a sale.
This is a critical distinction. Step two in the process, after the consumer has been interrupted, is to make an offer and ask for volunteers. The offer should provide selfish motivation and offer virtually no downside.
An interrupted consumer is in no hurry to send you money or promise to invest a lot of time. An interrupted consumer won’t fill out a long demographic form or get in his car to drive down to your automall. The less you ask of the consumer and the bigger the ‘bribe’, the more likely the consumer will give you permission. The permission won’t be broad or deep. But it will guarantee that your next interaction will be significantly more impactful.
When Hooked on Phonics ran nationwide radio advertising that helped them grow from zero to a hundred million dollars in revenue, they didn’t try to sell anything on the radio. They didn’t even mention the price. They sold the benefits by asking potential customers to call (800) ABCDEFG and get free information on how to help your kids. Free information. Help your kids. No downside. No money. This offer enticed millions of concerned parents to give permission to learn more about the product.
Hooked on Phonics gets far more attention from a completely qualified audience by using this two step approach. Imagine how much harder it would have been for them to generate the same level of sales if they had tried to make the sale on the radio.
In order to make the marketing messages you send relevant and personal you need to get some data. Permission marketers are totally obvious about their objectives with the consumer. They make it crystal clear what they will be doing with the data they collect, and exactly why it’s beneficial to the consumer to give this data.
Consumers who visit a web site are sometimes asked to give their phone number. But what’s in it for the consumer? Without a specific reason for the consumer to behave, without a reward or a benefit, the overwhelmed consumer will refuse.
The reward you offer a consumer must be obvious and simple. To dramatize the importance of this stage, to make it crasser than it needs to be, I call it bait. No one would argue that when you go fishing, you ought to use the most effective, most obvious bait you can find. The same is true when you try to attract consumers.
After you’ve interrupted, engaged in a bargain, and exchanged data with the consumer, now you need to teach, and eventually leverage the permission you’ve obtained.
If you’re in a medium where frequency is cheap (like the Net), take your time. Build trust through frequency.
Patiently tell your story to each consumer who is willing to participate in the exchange.
Be personal. Be relevant. Be specific. And always be anticipated. Anticipation, of course, is even better than expectation. Without surprising the consumer, gradually raise the level of permission you extract.
Then, by constantly raising the magnitude of rewards you offer the prospect, you can fight attrition and compression and keep them interested (compression is the tendency of rewards to become less effective with repetition). By continuing the dialogue, you can teach the consumer until a stranger becomes a friend and then a friend becomes a customer.
Of course, the process doesn’t end with the first sale. It just becomes one to one marketing. Using the permission already granted, you then work hard to expand the share of wallet and build a permission asset that is ever deeper and more powerful.
Getting the customer to raise their hand takes planning and capital Interrupting strangers and getting their attention in the first place is the glamorous part of marketing. Marketers and their advertising agencies live and die by the sizzle they create. They invest millions of dollars in a one minute commercial, just to maximize the effectiveness of the execution.
A copywriter can make his career with a clever ad. In fact, a thirty year old clever campaign for the Volkswagen came back from the dead to generate millions of dollars in new Beetle sales for VW in 1998.
At the same time that interruption marketers are arming themselves with these killer executions, they’re backing them with huge media budgets. Media budgets that often dwarf the cost of inventing or even manufacturing the product in the first place.
All of this time and money is spent with one goal in mind: interrupt people. If they remember the interruption the next day, even better. An interruption marketer who does a good job and boosts their direct mail response rate a tenth of a percent, or boosts morning-after recall a bit, is a hero. The entire point of the ad is to do that.
Wouldn’t it be great if we could eliminate this incredibly wasteful part of the process? Unfortunately, Permission Marketers cannot ignore the interruption part of the process. They can’t walk away from the cost of getting strangers to raise their hands. But they CAN leverage the expense of that interruption across multiple interactions.
This is the big win here. By leveraging one interruption across numerous communications, the Permission Marketer has an unfair advantage. One message becomes six or ten or a hundred. A momentary interruption becomes a dialogue that can last for weeks or months.
Let’s get specific and compare a marketer who had to make a single ad pay off with one who has the luxury of using Permission. The Interruption Marketer must earn back the entire cost of the ad after just one viewing. So, if it costs $2 to get one person to pay attention to the ad, it only pays off if, on average, it generates more than $2 in new business profits per viewing. If the impact is equal to or greater than the cost, go ahead and run the ad.
Running the same ad with frequency dramatically increases the amount of payback required. The marketer has to hope for $6 in new profits as a result of putting this ad in front of a prospect three times. If the third ad can’t generate enough impact to make it worth running, it doesn’t pay for itself.
Because frequency is free in an online Permission program, and much more effective offline, the marketer has the luxury of riding the impact curve up without a matching cost curve. Once the initial toll is paid, in other words, the rest of the ride is close to free.

"One way to look at the internet, mobile, web and tablets","
It might be about the size of the screen and whether or not you're standing up.
Start at the bottom. For the first five years of the Internet, the most used function was email. Email remains a bedrock of every device and system that's been built on top of the internet, though sometimes it looks like a text message or a mobile check in. This is the layer for asynchronous person to person connection, over time.
Moving from left to right, we see how the way we use the thing we call the internet has evolved over time. We also see how devices and technology and bandwidth have changed the uses of the net and, interestingly, how a growth in mass has led to a growth in self-motivated behavior.
Early online projects were things like Archie and Veronica and checking in changes to the Linux code base. You needed patience, a big screen and a sense of contribution.
Layer on top of this a practice that is getting ever more professional, which is creating content for others to consume. Sometimes in groups, sometimes using sophisticated software and talented cohorts.
As we move to the right (and through time) we see the birth of online shopping. Still to this day, most online shopping happens on traditional devices, often sitting down.
The sitting down part is not a silly aside. Ted Leonsis theorized twenty years ago that the giant difference between TV and the internet was how far you sat from the screen. TV was an 8 foot activity, and you were a consumer. The internet was a 16 inch activity, and you participated. I think the sitting down thing is similar. You're not going to buy an armoir while standing on the subway.
Moving over in time and device and intent, we see the idea of consuming content. While tablets get their share of shopping, this is where they really shine. I think 2011 is going to be the year of the tablet, from the Kindle to the iPad to the thing we used to call a phone.
It's in the last two categories that these other devices, things that don't involve sitting down, are superior, not just a mobile substitute. The social graph is a very low bandwidth, peripheral attention interaction, perfect for this audience and this medium. And the last category–tell me where I am, where to eat, who's near me, what's the weather, get me a cab right now–is all about me and now and here.
I don't believe this is a winner take all situation, any more than one bestselling book makes all other books obsolete. I think different pillars work for different devices, and there will continue to be winners in all of them.",,"Internet evolution, device usage, online interaction"
Cashing the check,"A check in your wallet does you very little good. It represents opportunity, sure, but not action.
Most of us are carrying around a check, an opportunity to make an impact, to do the work we're capable of, to ship the art that would make a difference.
No, the world isn't fair, and most people don't get all the chances they deserve. There are barriers due to income, to race, to social standing and to education, and they are inexcusable and must fall. But the check remains, now more than ever. The opportunity to step up and to fail (and then to fail again, and to fail again) and to continue failing until we succeed is greater now than it has ever been.

Self-destructive instructions,"If you ever have to say 'lighten up' to someone, you've failed twice.

Lost in a digital world,"Allison Miller, aged 14, sends and receives 27,000 text messages a month. Hey, that's only about sixty an hour, every hour she's awake.
Some say that the problem of our age is that continuous partial attention, this never ending non-stop distraction, addles the brain and prevents us from being productive. Not quite.
The danger is not distraction, the danger is the ability to hide.
Constant inputs and unlimited potential distractions allow us to avoid the lizard, they give the resistance a perfect tool.Everywhere to run, everywhere to hide.
The advantage of being cornered with nowhere to turn is that it leaves you face to face with the lizard brain, unable to stall or avoid the real work.

An hour after you haven't kept up with the world, you may or may not have work product to show as a result. If you don't, you've just called your bluff, haven't you? And if you do, then you've discovered how powerful confronting the fear (by turning off the noise) can be.
Ten years ago, no one was lost in this world. You had to play dungeons and dragons in a storm pipe to do that.

"30%, the long tail and a future of serialized content","The 1960s and 70s were the golden age of magazines. Why?
Enter tablets. To some, it feels like the dawn of a new golden age. People page through apps likeWiredand gasp at the pretty pictures and cool features. Surely, we're going to recreate that moment.
Here's the problem, and here's how Apple is making it much worse:
The newsstand is infinite. That means that far more titles will have far fewer subscribers. There are more than 60,000 apps on the newsstand. Hard to be in the short head when the long tail is so long…
plus, the cost of each issue is far higher, because it costs a lot more to pay a videographer, a video editor, a programmer, etc. than it does to pay John Updike to write 4,000 words…
plus, advertisers are harder to come by, because the number of readers is always going to be lower than it was back then, and the ads are easier to skip.
Of course, the good news is that the publisher doesn't have to pay for paper, so the profit on each subscriber ought to be way higher. Except…
Except Apple has announced that they want to tax each subscription made via the iPad at 30%. Yes, it's a tax, because what it does is dramatically decrease the incremental revenue from each subscriber. An intelligent publisher only has two choices: raise the price (punishing the reader and further cutting down readership) or make it free and hope for mass (see my point above about the infinite newsstand). When you make it free, it's all about the ads, and if you don't reach tens or hundreds of thousands of subscribers, you'll fail.
In a rare glitch,John Grubergot Apple's decision about the 30% subscription task completely wrong. By his logic, Apple would have been just as good for its users if the tax was 60%.
For content to be fabulous, for tablets to be more than game platforms, folks like Apple need to do two things:
The web has been a hotbed of siloed content, of deep dives for small audiences. The large scale stuff, though, has tended to be mostly about gossip and other quick reads that's cheap to produce. Tablets offer a new chance to create content worth paying for. Paving the way for that to happen is a smart move for anyone who cares about the audience and the devices.","February 25, 2011","subscription model, digital content, Apple tax"

An atomic theory of business size,"The magic of the periodic table is that every atom is one thing or another–there isn't a stable element that's sort of oxygen and sort of nitrogen. If there were, there would be millions of elements, not a few hundred.
That's because electrons are (more or less) either here or there. The quantum levels ensure that there areno weird hybrids.
A business follows a similar model. A local mom and pop store is just the right size for mom and for pop. The rent is low enough for the two of them to cover it. It's stable. They can't afford a $200,000 a year CFO. It wouldn't be a stable situation.
This is backwards but here you go: businesses that exist exist because the marketplace allows them to function at the right size. There were a lot of bowling alleys in the 1960s because the number of people you needed to run one plus the rent was just covered by the revenue you could expect. There was a right size, one that people were willing to take on and run.
The next level up from Mom and Pop feels different. Different furnishings, different rent, different payroll. It's not a little bigger, it's a whole quantum level different. And then down the street is the chain store, the one with 40 outlets and regional vice presidents and regional newspaper ads. Those things naturally go together, the scale is right.
Rightsizing your business is one of the most important decisions you can make. Just because you're thriving at one scale doesn't mean that a little more effort or a little more investment magically take you to the next. They probably don't.
Want to sell your popular donuts at Whole Foods? That's a quantum leap, not an incremental step.
Want your auction software company to become a public behemoth? It requires a leap of size and commitment, not a gradual creep.
Want to go from freelance work as a programmer to running a business like Fog Creek Software? Totally different list of requirements.
This is actually a good thing. It's good because rightsizing allows you to be profitable and live as a human. Those chasms in between are where people fall down.
One of the side effects of the internet revolution is that several new stable business sizes appeared. Groupon can do a billion dollars in revenue nationwide with far, far fewer employees than it took Target to hit the same level. A solo author can reach more people and generate more impact than she ever could have a dozen years ago.
These new sizes don't mean that the rules of quantum scale have gone away, though. That popular self-published author might be able to successfully employ six people, but there's no way she magically scales to sixty without something else changing. Several times I've run businesses that the market liked but couldn't find the right scale… adding more people didn't add a significant enough amount of revenue, and fewer people would have cost us our customer base. Just because it's a good idea doesn't mean that there's a scale that works.
When in pain, consider your scale. When you're too big or too small for the revenue or the impact you seek, you'll feel it in your bones. Leap.","February 24, 2011","business size, rightsizing, quantum scale"
A flip side: the asymmetrical gift,"Yesterday I bummed you out with ariffabout favors becoming impossible to fulfill. Worth a thought: the alternative, the good news that comes with the bad, is themassive asymmetric gift.
A gift is not a favor, because no recompense is implied or expected. A gift is just from me to you, that’s it.
The  internet makes it easy to give gifts to large numbers of people at very  very low cost.Editing a wikipedia article, for example, is a gift for  the ages, one that might be seen by a million people over three years.
This  leads to a new clause in the social contract. In this environment, we  expect that civilized participants will give. Just because. Because they  can. Because the gift makes all of it work better.
While mass favors have to fade (too easy to ask for, too unfair at scale), mass gifts show up to change the equation. Gifts are easy to scale, now, the more generous, the better. For all of us.","February 23, 2011","asymmetrical gift, social contract, mass gifts"
"Asymmetrical mass favors, a tragedy of our commons","If the farmer and the baker make a trade, both win. The farmer benefits from having someone turn his wheat into flour and bake it, and the baker gets money from the bread he sells that he can use to buy things he needs (like food).
This sample math of the transaction (Pareto, et. al.) created the world we live in. It also is connected to the idea of a favor.
A favor is the first half of a transaction.I ask you to do something for me today, something where I will probably benefit a lot in exchange for a small effort on your part. Inherent in the idea of a favor, though, is that one day soon, the transaction will be completed. One day, I will do something for you that gives you a benefit.
As Pareto and any economist will tell you, we willfully engage in this transaction because we'll benefit. Maybe not right now, but soon.
By spreading the idea of the trade over time, the favor makes trades more likely to occur, and also makes sure that they are even more efficient. If I’m already holding open the heavy door, holding it two more seconds for you is easy for me. And then, the next time you’re holding open the door, you’ll be more likely to hold it for me.
If I recommend you for a job, it doesn’t take much effort on my part, but you might get three years of gainful employment out of it. And of course, you’re happy to complete that transaction as soon as you can, because no one wants to walk around owing favors.
The efficiency caused by this sort of exchange is so extraordinary that we built it into the social contract. I’m not just selfish if I let the door slam as you walk toward the elevator–I’m rude. I’m risking becoming an outcast.
Favors are so ingrained that the next step was inevitable:Mass Symmetric Favors. Halloween is a great example: How else to explain a hundred million people buying half a billion Snickers bars? We give away the candy because it’s expected, and because people gave us candy when we were kids, and because people are giving our kids candy as well. To opt out is uncivilized.
School taxes create a similar obligation. If you don’t pay when you’re childless, there will be no one to pay when your kids are in school. (And you have to live in a world with uneducated people). And so the transactions are spread out over time, everyone giving and taking, not so much keeping score as knowing that a key part of civil society is to participate in these mass fungible favors.
But!
There’s a big but. The internet and other connecting tools now make it easy to create theasymmetrical mass favor–in which one person can ask alargenumber of people, some of them strangers, some friendlies, some friends–for an accommodation that may very well never be repaid.
The simple example is the person running for the Metro North commuter train that leaves at 5:20. She’s only 2 minutes late. If she misses it, she’s delayed half an hour. Surely the people on the train can wait a hundred and twenty seconds.
Not really. Not if there are 300 people on the train. That’s a ten hour penalty on the passengers, and if there’s no reasonable expectation of each of them somehow finishing the transaction one day in the future, the entire system will fall apart. No, in the abstract, we WANT the conductor to say ‘sorry.’
It gets far more dramatic when we think about spamming 10,000 or a hundred thousand people with your resume or plea for help.
The problem is that under the cover of the social contract, under the guise of doing what’s civilized, what some people are doing is beginning exchanges that they and those they engage withknowwill never be consummated.She's not transacting, she's taking.
And people resent her for it. “It can’t hurt to ask,” is almost never true, but here, especially, it hurts a lot. What the person looking for the favor is doing is actually undoing the tacit agreement we all live by, by seeking a favor when the recipient has no real (social) choice in the matter.
The favor is too important to be discarded, but the internet is making things that look like favors (but are actually asymmetrical takings) more and more common. It's putting pressure on people who are usually open to a favor to do the difficult thing and just say no.

Bankruptcy,"""Declaring Chapter 11""
What a poetic phrase, starting with 'declaring'. Not sighing or announcing or admitting, but Declaring!
Chapter 11 refers to part of the bankruptcy code that covers reorganizations. In Chapter 11, you don't shut down your business. Instead, faced with failure, you suspend certain agreements and debts and negotiate in a way that permits you to continue.
Chapter 7 is very different. It means ""I give up."" You shut down, it's over.
Metaphorically, we have the chance to declare either kind of bankruptcy whenever we work on a project or consider a habit, a social media addiction or even a job.Teetering on the edge of bankruptcy is painful. Declaring is often a relief.
Acknowledging that you're stuck is the very first step in getting unstuck…

What’s a slogan for (banal on purpose),"At MWC, Claes Magnusson saw the following slogans on 25 different high tech booths (companies like IBM, HP, etc.)

What are they for? Do they mean anything at all?
I think the big company corporate slogan is like heavy paper on the annual report, white space on the billboard and a suit on the sales rep. It's a signal, a sign that the company is big, that it's able to waste time dreaming this stuff up and waste money yelling about it. No one actually reads the slogan (at Yoyodyne, the internet company I founded in 1992, our stolen slogan was,""Where the future begins tomorrow.""It was written on our business cards and everything. I don't think 1 person in a 100 commented on it).

Two paths for successful group events,"I'm talking about trade shows, SXSW, street marketing…
There are two ways to be glad you went:
1. An overwhelming show of force. When you have the biggest booth, when you are the buzz of the event, when you are everywhere people look, you reinforce your position as the leader.
2. Powerful personal interactions. Not with everyone. Just with people who want to talk with you, who will benefit from a powerful exchange. Not mass, but high in value. Even better, designing these interactions (and your product) so that this small number of people set out to evangelize their peers on your behalf.
The mistake almost everyone makes is to do both. Or to believe that they know a cheap shortcut on their way to #1. Or to get too busy chasing (and failing) at mass that they don't have time to do the personal.
Years ago, the company I worked for spent millions at various venues of the Consumer Electronics Show. We were there, we were sort of big and we sort of won. But not really. Too much noise, too much competition, we were neither. By trying to reach as many as we could, we were never intimate enough to generate conversations that mattered or ideas that spread…
Once again, it comes down to scale. If you staff and invest appropriately, you don't have to 'win' the show to make it worth the trip. On the other hand, if you're setting out to win and investing at the appropriate level, youbetterwin.",,"group events, trade shows, personal interactions"
On pricing power,"If you’re not getting paid what you’re worth, there are only two possible reasons:1. People don’t know what you’re worth, or2. You’re not (currently) worth as much as you believe
The first situation can’t happen unless you permit it to. If you’re undervalued, then you have a communication problem, one that you can solve by telling accurate stories that resonate.
Far more likely, though, is the second problem. If there are reasonable substitutes for your work, and those substitutes are seen as cheaper, then you’re not going to get the work. 'Worth' in this case means, ""what does it cost to get something like that if something like that is what I want?""
A cheaper substitute might mean buying nothing. Personal coaches, for example, usually sell against this alternative. It’s not a matter of finding acheapercoach, it’s more about having no coach at all. Same with live music. People don't go to cheaper concerts, they just don't value the concert enough to go at all.
And so we often find ourselve stuck, matching the other guy's price, or worse, racing to the bottom to be cheaper. Cheaper is the last refuge of the marketer unable to invent a better product and tell a better story.
The goal, no matter what you sell, is to be seen asirreplaceable, essentialandpriceless.If you are all three, then you have pricing power. When the price charged is up to you, when you have the power to set the price, there is a line out the door and you can use pricing as a signaling mechanism, not merely a way to make a living.
Of course, the realization of what it takes to create value might break your heart, because it means you have to specialize, take risks, create art, leave a positive impact and adopt generosity in all you do. It means you have to develop extraordinary expertise and that you are almost always hanging way out of the boat, about to fall out.
The pricing power position in the market is coveted and valuable… The ability to have the power to set a price is at the heart of what it means to do business profitably, so of course there is a never-ending competition for pricing power.
The curse of the internet is that it provides competitive information, which makes pricing power ever more difficult to exercise. On the other hand, the benefit of the internet is that once you have it, the list of people who want to pay for your irreplaceable, essential and priceless contribution will get even longer.","February 17, 2011","Pricing power, value creation, market competition"

An acre of attitudes,"Anne Lamott relates an image from a friend in her great book on writing,Bird by Bird. My version:
Everyone is given an acre of attitudes at birth. It's yours to tend and garden and weed and live with. You can plant bitterness or good humor. Feel free to fertilize and tend the feelings and approaches that you want to spend time with. Unless you hurt someone, this acre is all yours.
Probably worth putting up a decent fence, so that only the attitudes that you choose will have a chance to put down seeds, but it's certainly a bad idea to put up a wall, because a walled garden is no good to anyone passing by. You get to decide what comes through your fence gate, right?
Watching out for invasive species—spending sufficient time on weeding and pruning and staking seem to be incredibly powerful tools for accomplishing the life you want. I refuse to accept that an attitude is an accident of birth or an unchangeable constant. That would be truly horrible to contemplate.
Happy Valentine's Day. Good luck with your garden.","February 14, 2011","attitudes, mindset, personal growth"
Treating best customers better,"To launch my first book with Amazon and theDomino Project, we're trying a neat experiment that rewards our biggest fans.
We're  going to set the launch price of the Kindle edition (which is also  readable on any computer or iPad) based on the number of people whosubscribeto our free newsletter. It started at $9.99 and we've already lowered it two dollars.
For every 5,000 people who sign up for the newsletter this week, we're going to lower the price of the ebook a dollar, until (we hope) we  reach a dollar. On the 21st of February, all our subscribers will  get a link to the URL that lets them pre-order the Kindle edition at a reduced price until the official publication date.
You get it first and you get it for less.
Details are here… Thanks for being a best customer.

Familiarity breeds respect,"It's nice to sign a letter, ""sincerely yours,"" but far more powerful, I think, to sign it, ""with respect."" It says something compelling about the recipient, something earned.
I realized the other day that I'd been working with the trio of Megan, Corey and Gil at Squidoo for five years, since we founded the company. And that I've been with Anne, my trusted bookkeeper, for more than ten years, David at GTN for almost as long, and Lisa, my agent, for more than seventeen. In an amazing bit of time travel, I've been doing projects with my friend Red for more than thirty.
Over time, you don't just come to trust valued colleagues like these, they also earn respect. Once you understand someone's sensibilities and goals, it's natural to see the world through their eyes and to embrace their motives and tactics. Once you've seen their work under pressure and in quieter moments, you get a sense for what they believe in. In a world of quick projects and short engagements, this sort of relationship is priceless.

"Ethical placebos (stunning, but not actually surprising)","A recent study found that placebosworkeven if the patient is told by the doctor that the drug they're taking has no 'real' medicine in it.
Huh?
We've come to understand that the placebo effect is real. If we believe we're going to get better, perform better, make the sale, etc., it often occurs that we do. That's because the brain is the single best marketing agent when it comes to selling ourselves something. If we think we're going to get better, we're much more likely to actually get better.
So then why do clearly labeled placebos work?
Because of the process. The ritual. The steps we go through to remember to take them, to open the bottle, to get the water, to swallow. Over time, we don't remind ourselves so much about what's in the pill and remind ourselves a lot that we're taking significant action.
This is one reason Disney makes you wait on line for a ride even if the park is empty. Why a full restaurant is more fun than an empty one, even if you know the food is precisely the same.
Marketers ostensibly know this, but it seems as though most organizations still act as though they're selling pencils to accountants.

What’s the use case?,"Visit an architect. On the first visit, right after shaking your hand, she unrolls plans for a house. ""Here are some sketches…""
Wait. That's backward.
Sketches for what? How do you know if I want a house or an office building? How am I to judge these plans? Is it a mind reading exercise?
The most effective way to sell the execution of an idea is to describe the use case first. And before you can do that, you need to have both the trust of your client and enough information to figure out what would delight them.
Then, describe what a great solution would do. ""If we could use 10,000 square feet of space to profitably service 100 customers an hour…"" or ""If we built a website that could convert x percent of …"" or ""If we could blend a wine that would appeal to this type of diner…""
After the use case is agreed on,thenfeel free to share your sketches, brainstorms and mockups. At that point, the only question is, ""does this execution support the use case we agreed on?""
Don't show me a project, a website, an ad buy or an essay without first telling mewhat it's supposed to do when it works properly. First, because I might not want that result. And second, how else am I supposed to judge if it's good or not without knowing what you're trying to do…

The new craftsmanship,"There's always been a bright line around the craftsperson, someone who takes real care and produces work for the ages. Everyone else might be a hack, or a factory guy or a suit or a drone, but a craftsperson was someone we could respect.
A craftsman might be a blacksmith or a carpenter, a visual artist or even a dedicated teacher. Someone to look up to.
Perhaps we're entering a new age of craftsmanship, one where we can see craft in the way a new business is devised, a sale is made or a website is coded. A craftsperson might be particularly talented and connected in the way she deals with clients, or be able to meet deadlines with alacrity.

How should you treat your best customers?,"Here's what most businesses do with their best customers: They take the money.
The biggest fan of that Broadway show, the one who comes a lot and sits up front? She's paying three times what the person just three rows back paid.
That loyal Verizon customer, the one who hasn't traded in his phone and has a contract for six years running? He's generating far more profit than the guy who switches every time a contract expires and a better offer comes along.
Or consider the loyal customer of a local business. The business chooses to offer new customers a coupon for half off—but makes him pay full price…
If you define ""best customer"" as the customer who pays you the most, then I guess it's not surprising that the reflex instinct is to charge them more. After all, they're happy to pay.
But what if you define ""best customer"" as the person who brings you new customers through frequent referrals, and who sticks with you through thick and thin?

Are $300 headphones worth it?,"A friend wanted to buyDr. Dreheadphones. They list for about $300.
Any audiophile can tell you that they sound like $39 headphones. Instead, considerthese. We can prove they sound better!
But of course, that's not the question. It's not what sounds better, it's what's worth it.
The Dre headphones come with admiring glances at no extra charge. They come with self-esteem built in. You can argue that this is a worthless feature in a device designed to reproduce sound accurately, but you'd be wrong. After all, the whole reason you're listening to music in the first place is to feel good. To be happy. If the Dre's make you happy, and your happiness is worth $300, then they're worth it, no?
For others (put me in that category) I get more happiness knowing that I didn't fall for a clever marketing ploy, and I buy the ones that I believesoundbetter.

Protecting the work,"In describing the role her brother played in producing one of her movies, Sofia Coppola said, ""he protected the film.""
As a producer, Roman saw his role as keeping the crew small, the project moving, the choices open so that Sofia could do her work. He protected the movie so that she could make it.

Compared to perfect: the price/value mismatch in content,"""How's the wine?""
You really can't answer that question out of context. Compared to what? Compared to a hundred dollar bottle? Not so good. Compared to any other $12 bottle… great!
""How was the hotel?""
""How's the service at the post office?""
In just about all the decisions we make, we consider the price. A shipper doesn't expect the same level of service quality from a first class letter delivery than it does from an overnight international courier service. Of course not.
And yet…
A quick analysis of the top 100 titles on Amazon (movies, books, music, doesn't matter what) showszerocorrelation between the price and the reviews. (I didn't do the math, but you're welcome to… might be a good science fair entry). Try to imagine a similar disconnect if the subject was cars or clothing…
For any other good or service, the value of a free alternative that was any good would be infinite–free airplane tickets, free dinners at the cafe… When it comes to content, though, we rarely compare the experience with other content at a similar price. We compare it to perfect.
People walking out of the afternoon bargain matinee at the movies don't cut the film any slack because it was half price. Critics piling on to a music video on YouTube never mention the fact that HEY IT WAS FREE.There is no thrift store for content.Sure, we can get an old movie for ninety-nine cents, but if we hate it, it doesn't matter how cheap it was. If we're going to spend time, apparently, it better be perfect, the best there ever was, regardless of price.
This isn't true for cars, potato chips, air travel, worker's comp insurance…
Consider people walking out of a concert where tickets might be beingscalpedfor as much as $1,000. That's $40 or more for each song played–are they considering the price when they're evaluating the experience? There's a lot of nuance here… I'm certainly not arguing that expensive is always better.
In fact, I do think it's probably true that a low priceincreasesthe negative feedback. That's because a low price exposes the work to individuals that might not be raving fans.
Free is a valid marketing strategy. In fact it's almost impossible for an idea to have mass impact without some sort of free (TV, radio, webpages, online videos… they're all free). At the same time, it's not clear to me that cheaper content outperforms expensive in many areas. As the marginal cost of delivering content drops to zero (all digital content meets this definition), I think there are valid marketing reasons to do the opposite of what economists expect.
Free gets you mass. Free, though, isn't always the price that will help you achieve your goals.
Price is often a signalling mechanism, and perhaps nowhere more than in the area of content. Free enables your idea to spread, price, on the other hand, signals individuals and often ends up putting your idea in the right place. Mass shouldn't always be the goal. Impact may matter more.","March 31, 2011","price/value mismatch, content evaluation, marketing strategy"

This is a mystery to me. A billion people have learned Chinese, and the failure rate for new kids is close to zero. If a well functioning adult puts in sufficient time and the effort, she''ll succeed.
The key to this disconnect is the unspoken part about time and effort and fear. I agree that you will never ship that product or close that sale or invent that device unless you put in the time and put in the effort and overcome the fear. But I don't accept for a minute that there's some sort of natural limit on your ability to do just about anything that involves creating and selling ideas.
This attitude gets me in trouble sometimes. Perhaps I shouldn't be pushing people who want something but have been taught not to push themselves. Somewhere along the way,  it seems, I forgot that it's none of my business if people choose to  accept what they've got, to forget their dreams and to not seek to help  those around them achieve what matters to them.
Not sure if you'll forgive me, but no, I'm not going to believe that  only a few people are permitted to be gatekeepers or creators or  generous leaders.

Lewis Hyde’s newbookis about the nature of ideas, and how they improve with use. It turns out that anyone who produces a totally new idea, something completely out of thin air, is unlikely to be a productive artist and a lot more likely to be seen as a total loon. Every artist builds on what came before. Ben Franklin, Bill Shakespeare, Alexander Graham Bell, Martin Luther King Jr., Shepard Fairey, Ricky Jay, Maya Angelou–all thieves.
Abbey Ryan is an artist on the leading edge of the painting-a-day practice. Like all visual artists, she finds her inspiration everywhere, from the supermarket to the work of other artists. Unlike some, though, she’s not reluctant togive creditto those that came before her.
For me, those that get all up in arms about sources of inspiration, the ones that misuse words like ‘plagiarism’ are rarely actively producing anything of value themselves. They’re merely trolls, eager to join a mob instead of spending their time and energy inventing, remixing and poking. If that’s all you can contribute–vague threats of lawsuits, insults and screeds–we’re better off ignoring you.
And for the self-styled producer who does nothing but copy and pass things off, we’re better off without you as well.
Now, more than ever, we can see the work an artist (in any medium, any endeavor) produces over time. If all an artist can do is steal, the truth will out.

Are you making something?,"Making something is work. Let’s define work, for a moment, as something you create that has a lasting value in the market.
Twenty years ago, my friend Jill discovered Tetris. Unfortunately, she was working on her Ph.D. thesis at the time. On any given day the attention she spent on the game felt right to her. It was a choice, and she made it. It was more fun to move blocks than it was to write her thesis. Day by day this adds up… she wasted so much time that she had to stay in school and pay for another six months to finish her doctorate.
Two weeks ago, I took a five-hour plane ride. That’s enough time for me to get a huge amount of productive writing done. Instead, I turned on the wifi connection and accomplished precisely no new measurable work between New York and Los Angeles.
More and more, we’re finding it easy to get engaged with activities that feel like work, but aren’t. I can appear just as engaged (and probably enjoy some of the same endorphins) when I beat someone in Words With Friends as I do when I’m writing the chapter for a new book. The challenge is that the pleasure from winning a game fades fast, but writing a book contributes to readers (and to me) for years to come.
One reason for this confusion is that we’re oftenusing precisely the same device todoour work as we are todistractourselves from our work. The distractions come along with the productivity. The boss (and even our honest selves) would probably freak out if we took hours of ping pong breaks while at the office, but spending the same amount of time engaged with others online is easier to rationalize. Hence this proposal:
The two-device solution
Simple but bold: Only use your computer for work. Real work. The work of making something.
Have a second device, perhaps an iPad, and use it for games, web commenting, online shopping, networking… anything that doesn’t directly create valued output (no need to have an argument here about which is which, which is work and which is not… draw a line, any line, and separate the two of them. If you don’t like the results from that line, draw a new line).
Now, when you pick up the iPad, you can say to yourself, “break time.” And if you find yourself taking a lot of that break time, you’ve just learned something important.

Not the point of this post. The question is: did you know about this chart? How does it resonate with you?
Vivid is not the same as true. It's far easier to amplify sudden and horrible outcomes than it is to talk about the slow, grinding reality of day to day strife. That's just human nature. Not included in this chart are deaths due to global political instability involving oil fields, deaths from coastal flooding and deaths due to environmental impacts yet unmeasured, all of which skew it even more if you think about it.
This chart unsettles a lot of people, because there must be something wrong with it. Further proof of how easy it is to fear the unknown and accept what we've got.
I think that any time reality doesn't match your expectations, it means that marketing was involved. Perhaps it was advertising, or perhaps deliberate story telling by an industry. Or perhaps it was just the stories we tell one another in our daily lives.

To seek out the permission and authority that comes from a publisher or talk show host or even a blogger saying, “I pick you.” Once you reject that impulse and realize that no one is going to select you–that Prince Charming has chosen another house–then you can actually get to work.

Coughing is heckling,"The other night I heard Keith Jarrett stop a concert mid-note. While the hall had been surprisingly silent during the performance, the song he was playing was quiet and downbeat and we (and especially he) could hear an increasing chorus of coughs.
""Coughs?,"" you might wonder… ""No one coughs on purpose. Anyway, there are thousands of people in the hall, of course there are going to be coughs.""
But how come no one was coughing during the introductions or the upbeat songs or during the awkward moments when Keith stopped playing?
No, a cough is not as overt or aggressive as shouting down the performer. Nevertheless, it's heckling.
Just like it's heckling when someone is tweeting during a meeting you're running, or refusing to make eye contact during a sales call. Your work is an act of co-creation, and if the other party isn't egging you on, engaging wth you and doing their part, then it's as if they're actively tearing you down.
Yes, you're a professional. So is Jarrett. A professional at Carnegie Hall has no business stopping a concert over some coughing. But in many ways, I'm glad he did. He made it clear that for him, it's personal. It's a useful message for all of us, a message about understanding that our responsibility goes beyond buying a ticket for the concert or warming a chair in the meeting. If we're going to demand that our partners push to new levels, we have to go for the ride, all the way, or not at all.","March 18, 2011","coughing, heckling, engagement"
Protecting the soft spot,"We all have one. Or more than one. It's that place where we can get hurt, the one we seek to defend.
For some people, it's a boss calling us out in front of our peers. For someone else, it's an angry customer. For someone else, it's being confronted with a problem you can solve–but that the effort just seems too great.
The key question is this: how much does the act of protecting the soft spot actually make it more likely you will be hurt?
It turns out that the more you angle yourself, the harder you work to protect the soft spot, the more likely it is that you'll get hurt.
All the time and effort you put into ducking and hiding and holding and avoiding might be sending the market a signal… the irony of your effort is that it's probably making the problem worse.","March 17, 2011","soft spot, protection, vulnerability"

Are you doing a good job?,"One way to approach your work: ""I come in on time, even a little early. I do what the boss asks, a bit faster than she expects. I stay on time and on budget, and I'm hardworking and loyal.""
The other way: ""What aren't they asking me to do that I can do, learn from, make an impact, and possibly fail (yet survive)? What's not on my agenda that I can fight to put there? Who can I frighten, what can I learn, how can I go faster, what sort of legacy am I creating?""
You might very well be doing a good job. But that doesn't mean you're a linchpin, the one we'll miss. For that, you have to stop thinking about the job and start thinking about your platform, your point of view and your mission.
It's entirely possible you work somewhere that gives you no option but to merely do a job. If that's actually true, I wonder why someone with your potential would stay…

"Bring me stuff that’s dead, please","RSS is dead. Blogs are dead. The web is dead.
Good.
Dead means that they are no longer interesting to the drive-by technorati. Dead means that the curiousity factor has been satisfied, that people have gotten the joke.
These people rarely do anything of much value, though.
Great music wasn't created by the first people to grab an electric guitar or a synthesizer. Great snowboarding moves didn't come from the guy who invented the snowboard… No one thinks Gutenberg was a great author, and some of the best books will be written long after books are truly dead.
Only when an innovation is dead can the real work begin. That's when people who are seeking leverage get to work, when we can focus on what we're saying, not how (or where) we're saying it.
The drive-by technorati are well-informed, curious and always probing. They're also hiding… hiding from the real work of creating work that matters, connections with impact and art that lasts. I love to hear about the next big thing, but I'm far more interested in what you're doing with the old big thing.","March 14, 2011","innovation, creativity, significance"

"Your SXSW agenda (or any conference, for that matter)","It costs a ton of time and money to go to something like SXSW. Other than having a blast, why go?
Here's an interesting way to think about it, something I've used to change the way I attend events (I don't do many, and won't be there, so have fun without me):
Think back a year ago to the last time you went. What do you remember?
Do you remember the presentations that were later on videotape? Do you remember the special screenings of movies? Do you remember the crowded cocktail parties? Bumping into a net celebrity?  I don't.
So I don't do them. At the last TED, I didn't attend a single session. They're fabulous, but I can always watch them later, on video.
Instead, I focus on what I do remember: the engaged conversations. The one on one discussions of what someone is working on. Helping a friend design a book cover or solve a thorny entrepreneurial problem. Sneaking out to go to a taco stand for lunch with a very cool CEO…
These are the reasons it is worth going. (At least for me). So do more of that, I think.
This isn't easy to do. Most conferences are organized around mass, not around individual interactions that last. It takes an effort to seek out conversations that matter.
Will people miss you if you don't show up next year? Why?","March 12, 2011","SXSW, conference experience, meaningful conversations"
Relentlessly smaller,"Some people work overtime to make their jobs smaller.
If your job is smaller you're less likely to make a mistake and more likely to please your boss.

Unskilled labor,"Perhaps it's time for a new definition.
Unskilled labor is what you call someone who merely has skills that most everyone else has.
If it's not scarce, why pay extra?
Skills matter. The unemployment rate for US workers without a college education is almosttriplethat for those with one. Even the college rate is still too high, though.  On the other hand, the unemployment rate for skilled neurosurgeons, talented database designers and motivated recombinant DNA biologists is essentially zero, despite the high pay in all three fields.
Unskilled now means not-specially skilled.","March 11, 2011","Unskilled labor, skills, unemployment"
Assuming goodwill,"Productivity comes from interactivity and the exchange of ideas and talents.
People are happiest when they're encouraged and trusted.
An airport functions far better when we don't strip search passengers. Tiffany's may post guards at the door, but the salespeople are happy to let you hold priceless jewels. Art museums let you stand close enough to paintings to see them. Restaurants don't charge you until after you eat.
Compare this environment of trust with the world that Paypal has to live in. Every day, thousands of mobsters in various parts of the world sit down intent on scamming the company out of millions of dollars. If the site makes one mistake, permits just one security hole to linger, they're going to be taken for a fortune. As a result, the company isn't just paranoid–they know that people reallyareout to get them.
This is the fork in the road that just about all of us face, whether as individuals or organizations. We have to make an assumption about whether people are going to steal our ideas, break their promises, void their contracts and steal from us, or perhaps, that people are basically honest, trustworthy and generous. It's very hard to have both postures simultaneously. I have no idea how those pistol-packing guys in the movies ever get a good night's sleep.
In just about every industry (except electronic money transfer, apparently), assuming goodwill is not only more productive, it's also likely to be an accurate forecast.

Herbs,"Thyme is cheap. Twenty five cents worth is plenty for a family of four.
Hang out at the market and watch people buy expensive fish, chicken or beef to cook for a family gathering. Almost no one is buying fresh herbs. What's that about?
I guess that the main course is so expensive and so much work and so apparently foreboding and complex that most people believe they can't be bothered with the effort of adding herbs. Herbs would change everything. A twenty-five cent investment would transform a simple but expensive dinner into something really great.
""What! I don't know how. It's not worth the effort. I'll screw it up. Isn't this expensive piece of fish enough? I'm too busy. Hey, it's just dinner…""

Famous to the family,"The way my family plays 20 Questions is that one person silently chooses a famous person and then everyone in the car has 20 yes or no questions to figure out who it is.
A variation that was briefly popular was to redefine ""famous"" as ""famous to the family."" You could announce that you had chosen this variation and then pick, say, Ziggy the painter. Zigmund might not be known to the public or the history books, but in our family, he's famous.
I'm fascinated by a new category, though. ""Famous to the tribe."" Is Xeni Jardin famous? Merlin Mann? What about Anne McCrossan? Never mind that Warhol thing about 15 minutes…
Everyone is famous to 1,500 people.
Some people are even famous to 3,000.
And that's a fascinating new phenomenon. When there are 3,000 or 10,000 or 500,000 people who think you're famous, who are willing to play 20 Questions where you are the answer…it changes things. We're not really prepared for a culture where a million (or a billion) people are valid answers in 20 Questions.
The race to be slightly famous is on, and it's being fueled by the social and tribal connections permitted by the net. We give a lot of credit and faith to the famous, but now there are a lot more of them. Over time, once everyone is famous, that will fade, but right now, the trust and benefit of the doubt we accord the famous is quite valuable.","March 8, 2011","fame, family, social networks"
Empathy,"""If I were in your shoes, I know what I would do.""
Marketers can't do their jobs without understanding what a prospect wants, talks about or is interested in.
And managers (and leaders) are ineffective when they're unable to imagine life through someone else's eyes.
The problem is this:if you were in my shoes, I wouldn't be me, I would be you.
As soon as you bring your beliefs, expectations and worldview to the table, you've lost the ability to imagine what someone else would do in this situation. All you're doing is imagining whatyouwould do.
The next time you're puzzled by the behavior of a colleague or prospect, consider the reason might have nothing to do with the situation and everything to do with who is making the decision and what they bring to it.","March 7, 2011","Empathy, Perspective, Understanding"
Cascade of broken promises,"… a cautionary tale. It's always easier to make a promise than it is to keep one, and if you're not careful, it compounds.
I got my new Macbook Pro the other day. It comes with Migration Assistant, a flawed piece of software that promises to easily transfer years of old data from one machine to another.
The software failed. (Promise broken). Having paid $99 for the One to One service (which promises individual hour long sessions), I make an appointment and head over to the store. Nate, the promised guide, doesn't know how to fix it, because, despite the promise, he's not trained to do so. He hands me over to a genius, Michael, who hears my story and promises to personally handle it (it takes ten hours to do the transfer, he'll watch over it and make sure it goes well.) He actually looks me in the eye and says, ""I promise to personally handle this.""
The next day, the phone rings. It's Aideen, who has the case, doesn't know who Michael is and doesn't know what to do. She leaves a message. I call back, talk to someone at the store who insists that Aideen isn't available but that someone will call me back within thirty minutes. He says, ""I promise that someone will call you within thirty minutes."" An hour later, no one has called back.
It goes on and on. Every employee means well. Every employee is overwhelmed by incoming traffic, most from people who have already had their promises broken. Every employee has discovered that it's easier to make a promise and pass it along than it is to either tell the truth or keep the promise.
The cascade starts with the product. When your brand makes promises it can't keep, your overworked staff bears the brunt.

The limits of evidence-based marketing,"That's what most of us do. We present facts and proof and expect a rational consumer/voter/follower/peer to make an intelligent decision on what's better.
That's how science works. Thesis, test, evidence, conclusion. All testable and rational.
Here's the conversation that needs to happen before we invest a lot of time in evidence-based marketing in the face of skepticism: ""What evidence would you need to see in order to change your mind?""
If the honest answer is, ""well, actually, there's nothing you could show me that would change my mind,"" you've just saved everyone a lot of time. Please don't bother having endless fact-based discussions.
[Apple tried to use evidence to persuade IT execs and big companies to adopt the Mac during the 80s. They tried ads and studies thatprovedthe Mac was easier and cheaper to support. They failed. It was only the gentle persistence of storytelling and the elevation of evangelists that turned the tide.]
What would you have to show someone who believes men never walked on the moon? What evidence would you have to proffer in order to change the mind of someone who is certain the Earth is only 5,000 years old? If they're being truthful with you, there'snothingthey haven't been exposed to that would do the trick. I was talking to someone who has a body of artistic work I respect a great deal. He explained to me his notion that the polio vaccine was a net negative, that it didn't really work and that more people have been hurt by it than helped.
I tried evidence. I showed him detailed reports from the Gates Foundation and from the WHO and from other sources. No, he said, that's all faked, promoted by the pharma business. There was no evidence that would change his mind.
Of course, evidence isn't the only marketing tactic that is effective. In fact, it's often not the best tactic. What would change his mind, what would change the mind of many people resistant to evidence is a series of eager testimonials from other tribe members who have changed their minds. When people who are respected in a social or professional circle clearly and loudly proclaim that they've changed their minds, a ripple effect starts. First, peer pressure tries to repress these flip-flopping outliers. But if they persist in their new mindset, over time others may come along. Soon, the majority flips. It's not easy or fast, but it happens.
That's why it's hard to find people who believe the earth is flat. That's why political parties change their stripes now and then. It wasn't that the majority reviewed the facts and made a shift. It's because people they respected sold them on a new faith, a new opinion.","March 6, 2011","evidence-based marketing, skepticism, storytelling"

For thousands of years, restaurants were dull. Feeding the public is hard work, and being a chef was perhaps a craft, but not often an art.
Consider, then, the case ofGrant Achatz, founding chef at the groundbreaking restaurant Alinea and his new restaurant, Next. Every three months, the restaurant is going to abandon its entire menu and start over. First up is a recreation of nineteenth century French food. Then, a futuristic Thai menu. Set it and forget it is precisely not the point. Given all the places you could go for dinner in Chicago, surely this one is now on the list… iniative is the reason.

I'd argue that the same thinking applies to the way you first encounter someone. You can certainly be over the top enough to get a handshake or even a meeting, but the thing that got you that meeting might be exactly what costs you the deal.

Jumping the line vs. opening the door,"Every morning, the line of cars waiting to get onto the Hutchinson River Parkway exceeds 40. Of course, you don't have to patiently wait, you can drive down the center lane, passing all the civilized suckers and then, at the last moment, cut over.
Drivers hate this, and for good reason. The road is narrow, and your aggressive act didn't help anyone but you. You slowed down the cars in the lane behind you, and your selfish behavior merely made 40 other people wait.
This is a different act than the contribution someone makes when she sees that everyone is patiently waiting to enter a building through a single door. She walks past everyone and opens a second door. Now, with two doors open, things start moving again and she's certainly earned her place at the front of that second entrance.
Too often, we're persuaded that initiative and innovation and bypassing the status quo is some sort of line jumping, a selfish gaming of the zero sum game. Most of the time it's not. In fact, what you do when you solve an interesting problem is that you open a new door. Not only is that okay, I think it's actually a moral act.

Initiators #1 [PTB],"To celebrate the launch ofPoke the Box, I'm going to profile a dozen people who have, in various ways, made the decision to lead, to poke, to initiate. Starting things is a scarce resource, the fuel we need to change things for the better.
Let's kick it off with Sasha Dichter, Director of Business Development at the Acumen Fund. He doesn't run a company, he has a boss, and he works for a non-profit. Certainly there's not a lot of room for initiative and innovation in a setting like this.
Except there is. Sasha has one of the most influential non-profit blogs online, something he started on his own. He has written provocativemanifestosand recentlylauncheda national holiday.
It's so easy to get hung up on reacting to incoming, on working through a checklist and on imagining what the boss wants you to do next. It's far more productive, I think, to decide where you want to go and then go there. And the power and low-price of online tools makes that easier than ever.
The key difference between initiators and everyone else is the simple idea of posture. What do you say to yourself in between assignments? What do you do when you see something that needs doing?
Sasha asks himself (not his boss), ""what's next?"" And that's the shift. You look at a world of opportunities and you pick one.Initiative is taken, it's not given.","March 1, 2011","Initiative, Leadership, Non-profit"
Who will say go?,"Here's a little-spoken truth learned via crowdsourcing:
Most people don't believe they are capable of initiative.
Initiating a project, a blog, a wikipedia article, a family journey. Initiating something even when you're not putatively in charge.
At the same time, almost all people believe they are capable of editing, giving feedback or merely criticizing.
So finding people to fix your typos is easy.
A few people are vandals, happy to anonymously attack or add graffiti or useless noise.
If your project depends on individuals to step up and say, ""This is what I believe, here is my plan, here is my original thought, here is my tribe,"" then you need to expect that most people will see that offer and decline to take it.
Most of the edits on Wikipedia are tiny. Most of the tweets among the billions that go by are reactions or possibly responses, not initiatives. Q&A sites flourish because everyone knows how to ask a question, and many feel empowered to answer it, if it's specific enough. Little tiny steps, not intellectual leaps or risks.
I have a controversial belief about this: I don't think the problem has much to do with the innate ability to initiate. I think it has to do with believing that it's possible and acceptable for you to do it. We've only had these doors open wide for a decade or so, and most people have been brainwashed into believing that their job is to copyedit the world, not to design it.
There's a huge shortage… a shortage of people who will say go.

Writing a book isn't that difficult for me (I've done it before), and it would have been easy to keep publishing books the traditional way, the way it's supposed to be done.

Choose your dreams carefully.
Everyone is entitled to adream. It gives us hope, focuses our energy, makes us human.
Sometimes, though, we get sold a dream instead of creating our own.
Is it really every girl's dream to become a princess, to be chosen by someone of royal birth and to have a $34 million wedding? Or is that the Disney-industrial complex betraying you, selling you short?
I just read that the folks who brought us the Mall of America are going to redo the troubled Xanadu shopping complex in New Jersey and rename it The American Dream. Is this the best we can do? Shop?

Headroom,"The only thing worse than being able to say, ""my boss won't let me,"" is having to acknowledge, ""my bosswilllet me.""
Over the last fifty years, the amount of headroom offered to white collar workers has dramatically increased. Piece work and time clocks have been replaced with self-policing and keep-your-own-calendar in many organizations. It's entirely possible to do very little, very often, particularly in a big company.
When we say, ""my boss won't let me,"" what we're often saying is, ""my boss wants great results, but she's not willing to let me take initiative without responsibility.""
I'd be shocked if any smart boss took a different approach. Who's going to give you authoritywithoutresponsibility?

The paperback choice and my video dilemma,"Linchpinis the bestselling and (judging from my inbox) biggest impact book I've ever written. Given the extraordinary feedback I've gotten from readers, it encouraged me to figure out ways to spread the idea to more people.
To that end, the paperback comes out today. It's four dollars cheaper, which in the scheme of things isn't a lot, but paperbacks have proven to make a huge difference in widespread adoption (Eat, Pray, Lovesold more than 1000% as many copies after they made the shift). I think a new format sends a message about sharability.
For impact, I still prefer thehardcover, but I really like that this new edition means that theKindle editionwill finally be fairly priced by my publisher–less thanhalfthe price it used to be.
To celebrate the paperback launch, I took the audio from a speech I did on the road trip last year and decided to make it into a video, adding the latest in snazzy motion graphics.
Things got out of hand.Way out of hand.
Paul, the creator of the graphics, ended up spending four months of his life on the animation, creating perhaps the most elaborate video of its kind. I gave him free rein to do what he liked, and he took it… 700 hours of creation, 1,000 pieces of art… the rendering alone took 27 hours. This project took on a life of its own, and it took blood, sweat, tears and money to finish it. What to do next?
My original thought was to create a DVD of the presentation and offer itfor sale for $300. Shipping worldwide included. Each copy comes with live performance rights, so you can present it to groups (but not online).
That's fine for corporations, coaches and organizations, but I wanted to share it with more people. One way is to create a complex system that would require you to submit a receipt for buying the paperback and getting some sort of passkey, etc.
I decided that this was too complex and not trusting enough.
Hence the honor system. The Road Trip video has been broken into four pieces for manageability and we inserted a tiny blurb for the paperback in each one. You can watch the entire video right now, at no extra cost, online. All you have to do is truthfully type in a password (The password is: iboughtthebook) when you watch each part of the video.Here's the link to the first part.

As soon as you say, ""failure is not an option,"" you've just said, ""innovation is not an option.""",,"Innovation, Failure, Success"
Changing personas,"This isn't easy. It's not easy for people or for organizations.
A marketing persona is the posture or approach or attitude you bring to the market. Your strategy might be speed or generosity or petulance. Over time, we tend to adopt the ones that work for us and abandon the others.
A scrappy startup has a persona of thumbing its nose at competitors and convention. It works. They do it more. Then, one day, the startup is actually the dominant player, and there's no one to thumb. A new persona is needed, or the company fails.
A cute kid starts out using the cute kid persona to get attention, treats and preferential treatment. Then he or she grows up and maybe isn't so cute any more. Suddenly, all the tricks that worked before don't seem to work now. No longer cute, now just angry.
A non-profit gets a boost at first because it's the new one, the untested, the great hope. The persona of insurgent fits them well. There are foundations and grants for innovators. A few years later, those grantors aren't so interested anymore, because they only fund the new. If the non-profit wants to keep growing, it will have to change its marketing story and attitude and posture so it appeals to the middle, not the edges.
Someone has success with pouting, with being hard to please, with occasional bits of bitterness. We want to soothe and entertain and please him, so the persona is effective. And then we don't any more. Switch the method you use to get attention or get used to being lonely.
Acknowledging the urgency of the problem and being aware of the need to change personas is the critical turning point for any of these marketers. Once you can see how a game that used to work has ceased to work, then, and only then, can you dream up a new game, a better one.
Please don't tell me about authenticity. Brands and personas are made, not born, and we use them because they work, not because our DNA orders us to. When they stop working, it's time to change them.
Being comfortable with the familiar persona you see in the mirror is not the same as having an appearance that helps you reach your goals.","April 27, 2011","personas, marketing, change"

The bully-victim cycle,"A bully acts up in a meeting or in an online forum. He gets called on it and chastised for his behavior.
The bully then calls out the person who cited their behavior in the first place. He twists their words, casts blame and becomes an aggrieved victim.
Often, members of the tribe then respond by backing off, by making amends, by giving the bully another chance.
And soon the cycle continues.
Brands do this, bosses do it and so do passers-by. Being a bully is a choice, and falling for this cycle, permitting it to continue, is a mistake.",,"bully-victim cycle, manipulation, accountability"
Alignment,"Long-term brands and relationships are built on alignment. Here are a few examples (""I"" is the royal I, not me in particular):
A perfect relationship: I want your company to help me, and your company wants to help me. We're both focused on helping the same person.
The Walmart relationship: I want the cheapest possible prices and Walmart wants to (actually works hard to) give me the cheapest possible prices. That's why there's little pushback about customer service or employee respect… the goals are aligned.
The Apple relationship: I want Apple to be cool. Apple wants to be cool. That's why there's little pushback on pricing or obsolence or disappointing developers.
The demagogue politician relationship: I will feel more powerful if you get elected and get your way. You will feel more powerful if you get elected and get your way.
The search engine relationship (when it's working): I want to find what I'm looking for. You want me to find what I'm looking for, regardless of the short-term income possibilities.
The Mercedes (formerly Cadillac) relationship: I want a prestige product that reliably delivers an expensive label that's unattainable to many. They want to reliably and consistently charge a lot for a car that sends a message to everyone else.
The farmer's market relationship: I want to eat sustainable foods that make me feel good. You want to grow sustainable foods that make me feel good.
Compare these to the ultimately doomed relationships (if not doomed, then tense) in which goals don't align, relationships where the brand took advantage of an opening but then grows out of the initial deal and wants to change it:
The Dell relationship: I want a cheap, boring, reliable computer. You want to make more profit.
The hip designer relationship: I want the new thing no one else has yet. You want to be around for years.
The search engine relationship (when it doesn't work): I want to find what I'm looking for. You want to distract me and take money to send me places I actually don't want to go.
The reluctant purchaser relationship: I don't want to waste money on something I didn't know I wanted. You want to make a commission.
The troll relationship: I want to laugh at a buffoon who doesn't realize he's making a fool of himself. You want to be respected by the mainstream.
The young actor relationship: I want the fresh-faced young movie star. You want a career that lasts more than a year.
The typical media relationship: I want to see the shows, you want to interrupt with ads.
Alignment isn't something you say. It's something you do. Alignment is demonstrated when you make the tough calls, when you see if the thing that matters the most to you is also the thing that matters the most to the other person.
The tension that comes from misalignment can work for a while, but it's when alignment kicks in that the enterprise really scales.","April 25, 2011","Alignment, Relationships, Branding"
The opportunity is here,"At the same time that our economic engines are faltering, something else is happening. Like all revolutions, it happens in fits and starts, without perfection, but it's clearly happening.
The mass market is being replaced by multiple micro markets and the long tail of choice.
Google is connecting buyers and sellers over vaster distances, more efficiently and more cheaply than ever before.
Manufacturing is more of a conceptual hurdle than a practical one.
The exchange of information creates ever more value, while commodity products are ever cheaper. It takes fewer employees to generate more value, make more noise and impact more people.
Most of all is this: every individual, self-employed or with a boss, is now more in charge of her destiny than ever before. The notion of a company town or a stagnant industry with little choice is fading fast.
Right before your eyes, a fundamentally different economy, with different players and different ways to add value is being built. What used to be an essential asset (for a person or for a company) is worth far less, while new attributes are both scarce and valuable.
Are there dislocations? There's no doubt about it. Pain and uncertainty and risk, for sure.
The opportunity, though, is the biggest of our generation (or the last one, for that matter). The opportunity is there for anyone (with or without a job) smart enough to take it–to develop a best in class skill, to tell a story, to spread the word, to be in demand, to satisfy real needs, to run from the mediocre middle and to change everything.
¡Note! Like all revolutions, this is an opportunity, not a solution, not a guarantee. It's an opportunity to poke and experiment and fail and discover dead ends on the way to making a difference. The old economy offered a guarantee–time plus education plus obedience = stability. The new one, not so much. The new one offers a chance for you to take a chance and make an impact.
¡Note! If you're looking for 'how', if you're looking for a map, for a way to industrialize the new era, you've totally missed the point and you will end up disappointed. The nature of the last era was that repetition and management of results increased profits. The nature of this one is the opposite: if someone can tell you precisely what to do, it's too late. Art and novelty and innovation cannot be reliably and successfully industrialized.
In 1924, Walt Disney wrote a letter to Ub Iwerks. Walt was already in Hollywood and he wanted his old friend Ubbe to leave Kansas City and come join him to build an animation studio. The last line of the letter said ""PS I wouldn't live in KC now if you gave me the place—yep—you bet—Hooray for Hollywood."" And, just above, in larger letters, he scrawled,""Don't hesitate—Do it now.""
It's not 1924, and this isn't Hollywood, but it is a revolution, and there's a spot for you (and your boss if you push) if you realize you're capable of making adifference. Or you could be frustrated. Up to you.","April 24, 2011","Opportunity, Micro Markets, Revolution"
The realization is now,"Newpollingout this week shows that Americans are frustrated with the world and pessimistic about the future. They're losing patience with the economy, with their prospects, with their leaders (of both parties).
What's actually happening is this: we're realizing that the industrial revolution is fading. The 80 year long run that brought ever-increasing productivity (and along with it, well-paying jobs for an ever-expanding middle class) is ending.
It's one thing to read about the changes the internet brought, it's another to experience them. People who thought they had a valuable skill or degree have discovered that being an anonymous middleman doesn't guarantee job security. Individuals who were trained to comply and follow instructions have discovered that the deal is over… and it isn't their fault, because they've always done what they were told.
This isn't fair of course. It's not fair to train for years, to pay your dues, to invest in a house or a career and then suddenly see it fade.
For a while, politicians and organizations promised that things would get back to normal. Those promises aren't enough, though, and it's clear to many that this might be the new normal. In fact, itisthe new normal.
I regularly hear from people who say, ""enough with this conceptual stuff, tell me how to get my factory moving, my day job replaced, my consistent paycheck restored…"" There's an idea that somehow, if we just do things with more effort or skill, we can go back to the Brady Bunch and mass markets and mediocre products that pay off for years. It's not an idea, though, it's a myth.
Some people insist that if we focus on ""business fundamentals"" and get ""back to basics,"" all will return. Not so. The promise that you can get paid really well to do precisely what your boss instructs you to do is now a dream, no longer a reality.
It takes a long time for a generation to come around to significant revolutionary change. The newspaper business, the steel business, law firms, the car business, the record business, even computers… one by one, our industries are being turned upside down, and so quickly that it requires us to change faster than we'd like.
It's unpleasant, it's not fair, but it's all we've got. The sooner we realize that the world has changed, the sooner we can accept it and make something of what we've got. Whining isn't a scalable solution.

Improving the trains,"While making the trains run on time is a good thing, making them run early is not.
If you define success as getting closer and closer to a mythical perfection, an agreed upon standard, it's extremely difficult to become remarkable, particularly if the field is competitive. Can't get rounder than round.
In general, purple cows live in fields where it's possible to reinvent what people expect.","April 22, 2011","trains, improvement, standards"
Hungry or guarded,"The hungry person at the all you can eat buffet is happy to take one more item. She doesn't spend a lot of time comparing this to that, or saying 'no thank you' or avoiding certain items. If it's interesting, ""sure I'll try a little bit. I can always come back.""
The guarded person walking down the street avoids eye contact with the homeless person, doesn't answer a request from the petition-signer and certainly doesn't help a Boy Scout with that old lady.
And this is precisely the dichotomy every cause, every candidate and every marketer faces.
Either you're selling to people who are hungry for what you offer, who are open to hearing what you have to say, who arefans…
Or you're selling to people who are actively protecting themselves, guarding against interruption or a mistake or worse.
How can you possibly have a strategy about what you're going to do next until you determine which mindset you're marketing to?
Here's the key truth: in any given moment, in any given situation, a person is either hungry or guarded. You need to decide which sort of person you'll be telling your story to, because one approach won't work on the other type of person.
