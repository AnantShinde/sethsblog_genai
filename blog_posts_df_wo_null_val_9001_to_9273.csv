Normalizing selfishness,"Shoplifters lurk in the shadows. They realize that they will have an easier time if they quietly steal stuff, because speaking up about it won’t help their cause.
Sometimes, though, some people seek to change the culture in a way that celebrates taking. “I own this jetski and I can ride it as long, as loud as I want to. Get out of my way.” It’s clearly in the owner’s interest to take over the lake, but not really in anyone else’s.
It’s a short-term dead end, though. Your selfish today will probably be replaced by somebody else’s selfish tomorrow.

Optimized or maximized?,"Engineers can optimize a bridge. There are some bridge designs that satisfy aesthetic, financial, durability, safety and efficiency needs better than others. The work of optimization is finding the best set of tradeoffs.
Maximization, on the other hand, seeks the solution that ranks the highest for just one goal.
After it peaked, Yahoo sought to maximize short-term stock price (and the needs of its top executives) instead of optimizing for customer experience, innovation, resilience and utility.
Over time, social networks fade away for similar reasons. They turn users into the product instead of treating them like customers.
Maximizing something is simple and may be satisfying. It doesn’t involve difficult tradeoffs and it’s easy to measure.
But that doesn’t mean it’s a good idea.","January 28, 2024","Optimization, Maximization, Tradeoffs"
Unaware,"If you don’t realize that you have power, you might not be able to exercise it.
The power to speak up, to participate, to invent, to lead, to encourage, to vote, to connect, to organize, to march, to write, to say ‘no’ or to say ‘yes’.
It’s tempting to imagine we have less power than we do. It lets us off the hook. For now.","January 27, 2024","power, participation, awareness"
Coercion,"One way to look at power is “you get to tell people what to do.”
But an alternative is that the most powerful institutions, brands and people are the ones who are in alignment with their audience.

"A good idea, well executed","Why isn’t this enough?
There are plenty of good ideas, easy to learn from and copy.
There are countless projects, well executed, with the steps on display.
Any entrepreneur could find a local business and bring a version of it from over here to over there.
And a social change maker could find a successful non profit and simply follow the playbook.
None of this is enough.
The scarce piece is the willingness to say, “go.”
To sign up and to stick with it.
To hope, to dream, to push through the dip and most of all, take responsibility.

Communications hygiene (and the demise of texting),"Attention is scarce.
Decisions are difficult.
Searching takes effort.
For thirty years, texting has been a powerful medium. It’s the thing that vibrates in our pocket. It promises something urgent, and a reply that’s demanded equally urgently.
“I’m running ten minutes late,” is a fine text, and “okay” is a great response.
Like all digital media that works, it’s sticky and has a powerful network effect. Once someone sends you a text, you need to send one back. Once your colleagues are texting, you need to text as well. It works better when you do it the way others are doing it.
And, like all digital media that works, it gets corrupted. Sometimes by evil spammers that send texts pretending to know you, “want to play golf tomorrow?” or “your wife said you were selling your house…”. And sometimes by people who aren’t evil at all, but simply have a different sense of the medium than you do.
And so here’s a text in which 15 people are cc’ed. You don’t know most of them, so all you see is their phone numbers. And it requires you to stop what you’re doing and open your calendar and calculate whether that day is free or not. And whether the people you hope to interact with are going or not. And of course, if anyone hits reply, everyone gets the reply. And of course, one of those people then decides to ‘get the word out’ and tell everyone else on the thread about their unrelated garage sale, coming up in just a few days…
Pretty soon, your pocket vibrates enough with both kinds of texts often enough that you simply don’t prioritize checking, and then, the next time an urgent text comes along, well, it’s ignored.
Texting is first come next served. There’s no nuance to it, no priority list, nothing but ‘I read it’ or ‘I didn’t.’
The asymmetry of the dynamic here sows the seeds of the demise. It’s up to every single person you know to protect your attention, up to each of them to be generous and discreet and not waste your time. And the cost of them simply doing what everyone else is doing is so low that the whole thing begins to degrade.
Add to that the ease with which telemarketers and spammers can now weaponize your initial contact (14 notes about one dinner reservation!) and you can see how the path only goes one way.
The magic of widespread media like the telephone, email and texts is that it’s an open API. No one is actually in charge of the inputs, but this is also the problem.
I’m hopeful that services liketexts.comor even the folks in Cupertino will take a deep breath and create a protected tier for useful interactions that actually have permission. The structure of the interface determines the utility of the system. If it’s easy to cc 15 strangers, people will.
In 1994, I led a team that invented games you could play by text. It almost turned into a killer idea, and maybe it’ll be back one day.
And in 1999, I tried to coordinate the work around buying cheap stamps for email, so that the API might be slowed and focused a bit.
Perhaps AI will start being an (imperfect) filter, but the problem is so hard to solve after the fact, I’m not optimistic.
The rule is pretty simple:bad noise crowds out good signalin just about any useful communications medium. The opportunity is to design against bad noise and to be vigilant about maintaining the magic that made it useful in the first place.","January 23, 2024","Communications hygiene, Texting, Attention management"
It’s Mac Day (#40),"A lot shifted when the Apple Macintosh was introduced, and it wasn’t about the RAM, the chips or the processor speed. Our world changed forty years ago today. Marketing, technology, commerce, luxury brands, communities, communication and our expectations for how we might spend our future all shifted, and fairly quickly.
Guy Kawasakibrought me one to use as a beta tester. I was 23 years old and amazed. What I didn’t realize was that revolutions like this were extremely rare, and here was one, at exactly the right moment for my career and for a new cadre of creators.
A big shift the Mac announced was turning the computer from a hobbyist novelty into the center of pop culture, productivity and creative work. The Commodore 64 was a toy. This was a car. The first leap like this since Henry Ford.
The device itself didn’t do nearly as much as we hoped it would (yet), but the clear and actionable promises that it brought with it changed what we expected and imagined might be next.
Regis McKennanever got enough credit for being the visionary behind so much of the marketing and the ripples it caused.Susan Karebecame a minor celebrity–for giving a computer a face and a personality.
It was the first time the launch of a new product (other than the Edsel, perhaps) was a media event of this magnitude.
The Super Bowl ad (which Jobs didn’t even want to do) marked a shift from ads being about the product to also being about the ads.
Once we got the joke, we wanted to tell everyone else. Insiders and outsiders. Early adopters and the mainstream. Evangelists. A pattern that’s been repeated hundreds of times since then.
There are few concepts that can’t be explained with an Apple anecdote, and it largely began with the launch of this one device.
[I invented two devices to work with the Mac–the first fax board in 1986, and a precursor to Sonos that would pipe your music across the room. It turns out that it’s easier to write about Apple than to work with them…]
I’m typing this on perhaps the 20th (okay, 40th) Mac I’ve owned. The pace of innovation has now slowed to a crawl as Apple seeks to take profits instead of following the path that the Mac started down two generations ago–to not just sell a product, but to change the culture.
Even if they’ve lost the instinct to make something insanely great, they taught people all over the world to want to do so.
The change we make is at the heart of the work we’re able to do.","January 22, 2024","Apple, Macintosh, innovation"
Stumbling in the dark,"Learning is complicated.
While we’re doing it, it’s easy to imagine that those around us are completely sure of themselves, moving forward in a well-lit space.
In fact, if you visit a growing company, a useful school or anywhere that growth is happening, you’ll quickly see that everyone is stumbling forward in the shadows.
That’s part of the deal.","January 21, 2024","Learning, Growth, Uncertainty"
Out to get you,"It’s easy to believe that in some moments, the world is out to get you.
This is unlikely. The world hardly knows you exist.
There is injustice and trauma and systems of caste. There are tiny pockets of humanity that hold a grudge.
But most of the time, in most situations, what happened happened and our story about it is up to us and us alone.
It’s not personal, it’s the system. The system is unaware of where we are, and the system is often visible to us before we begin our journey if we pay attention.
When things don’t go the way we hope, one alternative is to look hard at the system that caused the problem. And another productive strategy is to figure out what to do with what we get, instead of seeking to find the villain that’s causing our problem.","January 20, 2024","perception, system, accountability"
Decoding ‘story’,"Marketers like to talk about the story we tell.
And non-marketers imagine that we’re referring to Goldilocks and other ‘once upon a time’ moments.
Because stories are the basic building block of culture, it’s difficult to see the nuance in this simple word. But one or two examples can help.
A new saw might have a story. A home woodworker isn’t cutting wood for a living–it’s a hobby. When a new saw from Festool comes out, the thoughtful design plants a seed for the home woodworker. From that moment on, every cut with the old saw feels like a compromise or even an insult. And the SawStop table saw is a story as well… every time a home woodworker is about to cut with their old saw, they visualize life without a finger or two… the story is far more emotional than the specs of the item itself.
Bottled water is a story. In countries where the water isn’t regularly safe to drink, there’s the simple, practical story of not getting sick.
But in wealthy countries, bottled water is a symbol. It’s a symbol for a lot of things, including status. It’s a statement about a certain kind of healthiness or self-care. And all of that rolls up into a story that is rarely put into words. When you buy bottled water in a restaurant, what are you buying?
When environmental organizations started to tell the story of millions of discarded bottles floating in the ocean, it was pretty easy for many bottled water purchasers to ignore. After all, that’s over there, and this bottle is over here. And after all, those bottles in that ocean aren’t about me or affecting me, so I’m not really aware of them. And of course, don’t blame me, because I put my bottle in a blue bin…
A far more powerful story just appeared in a scientificjournal. It explains that there are 100 times as many microparticles of plastic in bottled water than had been previously estimated. 100 times as many particles that are small enough get into the bloodstream. Billions of tiny health risks.
This is a story that will probably stick with many of the people who didn’t want to hear the other story. Because now, looking at that clear bottle of status and health, it is easy for it to look like a bottle of poison.

“I didn’t get in”,"There are two ways to process this:
The selection committee saw me, understood me, and then decided to reject me.
or
The selection committee didn’t get what I had to offer. I wasn’t rejected, my application was. It’s not that I didn’t get in, it’s that they didn’t engage with the story I told.
We can always do a better job of finding the place where we might thrive. And a better job of living and telling the story that earns us a chance to get to that place.

Who pays?,"Supply and demand are always in a dance, with one outpacing the other from time to time.
In the last three years, the green tech revolution has accelerated dramatically. Countless companies are being created to change how food is grown, people are transported and energy is created. I’ve been stunned by the pace as well as the passion of many of the people working on these projects.
The bet some are making is that greener tech will simultaneously be cheaper, easier and more convenient.
And then, of course, everyone will switch, and the investments will pay off.
But new tech is rarely cheaper, easierandmore convenient. And new tech that involves energy almost never is.
And so, we see Hertz losing their nerve and selling off electric cars. “There’s insufficient demand” combined with “it’s not as convenient…”
The problem here is one of timing. We’re asking the users of the new tech to do most of the paying, even though we all benefit.
We benefit from the experience curve that will ultimately enable the price-performance ratio of these technologies to improve.
And most of all, we all benefit by saving money on healthcare, climate remediation and unpredictable disasters.
Building a bridge between now and later is often a challenge when we seek to rewire our tech. The internet only arrived because DARPA and others kept it going for more than twenty years before it clicked.

Variety and the long tail,"In aWe Are All Weirduniverse, there are two sorts of cultural disappointments.
The first has been around since the dawn of cable: We don’t all watch the same thing. We don’t all talk about it, hits aren’t really hits, not like they used to be. There’s no comparison in the reach of M*A*S*H and the Crown. (In fact, it’s about 25:1).
It’s easy to miss the feeling of a monoculture if you grew up with it. Hits gave us something to talk about, adhere to or even work against. There are so many pockets of culture, it can’t help but feel a bit more lonely from a certain angle.
But the new one is one I’m hearing for the first time, from younger culture denizens who didn’t grow up in the monoculture. They’re arguing that we’re headed back to a monoculture, where filters, memes and the rapid spread of ideas are making everything the same again. The pressure to be in the short head is great, the desire for variety is shrinking in the face of the monopoly’s algorithms and it’s all becoming mush.
Sure, a hipster coffee shop in Tokyo feels a lot like one in Boise. But no, that can’t be compared to the hegemony of the orange-roofed Howard Johnson’s or yellow-arched McDonald’s that made every road trip exactly the same. Yes, Sysco puts the same sugar packets everywhere, but at the same time, there are three Ethiopian restaurants in Cleveland right now. I’m pretty sure that when I was stranded there in 1974, there weren’t any. Consider that they’re now discussing the bestbagelsin … Seattle. (or the bestbreadin Paris, the bestchocolatein Missouri, ethicalspices, or even the bestgluten-free cakesin New York).
The math is simple: more people are consuming more of everything than ever before, but there are very few hits of real scale. That means that many of us spend our time in niches, not in the center.
The number one variety of beer, music, sporting event, sneaker, jeans, religious practice and automobile is: OTHER. Yes, the filters keep pushing to make the hits less interesting, but the long tail stays long.
None of the aboveis going to be here for a while longer.","January 16, 2024","monoculture, long tail, cultural variety"

Looking for a handle,"What if your boots don’t have any straps?
Bootstrapping is logically impossible. You can’t pick yourself up into the air by lifting on your boots, no matter how hard you try, because gravity isn’t just a good idea, it’s the law.
But it’s significantly more difficult if your boots don’t have straps.
The word “purchase” has many meanings, but the most eloquent one describes the foothold we find when we’re trying to climb a wall. If you can’t find a spot to stand, it’s hard to get to where you hope to go.
And sometimes, we willingly get stuck. Or we create situations where others do.
If we’re afraid or benefitting from feeling trapped, we start to eliminate the handles. We know that taking a course, going for a walk or asking for help might move us forward, so we work hard to avoid those things. If the desire to stay stuck is strong, we’ll do anything we can to avoid offering purchase to ourselves or to anyone else who is trying to help.

Customer service is a choice,"It’s either part of your strategy or you’re paying for your mistake.
800 numbers changed the way large brands dealt with the public. Instantly, and for free, a consumer could contact a company about a product or service and they would work to make it right.
It was more than fodder for an infinite number ofNew Yorkercartoons. Some brands made it a part of their marketing strategy (Zappos, for example) while others saw it as a bottomless expense and did as little as they could (Google, for one.) The successful companies in the no-support group spent the money they saved on user experience, working hard to make it so you’d never need to call them.
Both are defensible choices. Great customer service is expensive, but it’s also free. It’s free because delighting a customer who has an issue is the single cheapest way to not only keep that customer, but also have them spread the word.
Building a new car company is difficult and expensive. Rivian has adopted the strategy of being the most honest, diligent and responsible car company in history. They answer the phone in one ring, a helpful person actually helps, and they work overtime to make things right. If you meet someone with a Rivian, just ask them.
A much smaller company, Discourse, supports their software with a community approach that’s human, interactive and effective. It’s not as expensive as having a car towed away, but it supports customer loyalty and decent margins.
Delightfully, great companies like PSAudio are following their lead, using Discourse to help customers become connected and find support. It provides a layer of insulation that other companies struggle to keep up with.
On the other hand, Firstbase.io, a new company aiming to service founders of new companies, has completely lost their way. They take as long as five business days to respond to a query, their UX is terrible and they generally don’t care, or at least act like they don’t. Unlike Google, who decided to build a customer-facing product that didn’t need support, Firstbase is simply in cost-cutting mode. It’s broken and they know it.
You can’t cost cut your way to greatness.
Consumers have been trained to expect that companies will engage.

You know what it can do and how it will change your life and you don’t want it.
You don’t know what it can do and you don’t want to find out.
Kevin Kelly has pointed out that many Amish communities are in the first camp. They designate a few community members as nerds who can try out a technology and report back on how it changed their families and their focus. The end result is that they often make the intentional choice to avoid something that they deem counter to their goals.

PW 4: Productivity and tools,"Adam Smith and Karl Marx both wrote about the pin-making machine. Not too long ago, pins (for hats, to hold shirts in place, etc.) were incredibly expensive. They were a luxury item, and a handmade pin might cost more than buying lunch.
The pin-making machine changed this. It transformed the labor of four trained workers from 20 pins a day to 10,000.
It’s pretty clear that if you wanted to make pins productively, you’d want to own one of these devices.
Industrial productivity progress grows and then ebbs or levels out. The inclined plane. The shovel. The assembly line. The computer chip. Robots…
When it’s leveling out, some people insist it will never rise again. And yet it does.
The tools that are available to each of us are so powerful, so varied and so complex that even the free ones are ignored or misunderstood. We’re too busy doing work to get much done.
And so we end up with the convenient and sexy tools (like the smartphone you might be reading this on) and fail to do the few hours or days of training we might need to transform our productivity with desktop tools or thought-through and optimized AI and workflow improvements.

Productivity is the measure of the output (value) we get for the time or money we spend.
Two hats for productivity:
When I’m clearing my inbox, responding to comments in a doc, cooking lunch–these are chores.
Chores are the backbone of industrial productivity. We can check them off, measure them and see them stacked up.

By association,"We’re busy, we’re confused and we’re always seeking a shortcut.
If a company is hiring, the person who worked at Google or Apple or Disney gets more of the benefit of the doubt. Even if all they did was bring coffee to someone.
But, if that person was one of the hundreds laid off yesterday as a result of Apple shuttering their car project, not so much.
If you get pitched by someone who worked at Bird or Theranos or General Magic, what pile do they go in?
What about someone who was the assistant to an actor who just got nominated for an Academy Award vs. someone who worked for a has-been?
It’s not hard to extend this to people who went to a school with a successful football team, or who are part of a group that traditionally is given an advantage due to an accident of birth.

What are the stakes?,"How big a swing do we need to make it feel like it matters?
At the casino, some folks play with $5 chips, some with $100 chips. Do the high rollers have more fun? Are they more engaged?
It’s natural to imagine that bigger swings matter more. That a bigger audience means our standup needs to be better, or a bigger investment is a signal that our business matters more.
More and better aren’t the same.
There are very few projects that have an impact on every human. Most are more local than that. Winning the regional Math Olympiad can feel just as important as winning the Super Bowl, and entire countries will be unaware of both events.

The close proximity gap,"One of the unmentioned causes of division in much of our culture happens because of the shift in expectations and rules when we begin to live in close proximity to one another.
In a non-crowded setting, the default is independence. The expectation is that you can drive as fast as you like, do whatever you like with your land, say anything that’s on your mind.
In a city, proximity raises the stakes for how our behavior influences others. Interdependence becomes a benefit. So don’t tailgate, turn down the stereo in your apartment and realize that your words and behavior impact the folks around you.
Both are forms of freedom. The freedom to do what you want and the freedom to live in a connected culture.
When we move online, everything and everyone is just a click away. We’re constantly in close proximity to people of different ages, backgrounds and goals.
And when the world continues to get smaller and more entwined, close proximity dominates. Buying a dozen bottles of water at the market (even if they’re on sale) costs everyone else. Those bottles are going to go somewhere when you’re done with them, and the world is smaller than ever before.

The grey goo,"If we take a big enough dataset…
Add to it machine learning and autotune and the race to fit in and reach the masses…
We end up with a relentless march toward mediocrity. Mediocre is another word for average.
It has always happened as industries matured (whether it’s Motown or blenders). But then, often, a human being shows up with something that ‘everyone’ says isn’t going to work, and the game is reset.
Just about all bestsellers are surprise bestsellers.
But the forces of mediocrity are now microprocessor-powered, heavily funded, and determined to hold on to the middle of the market. More grey, more goo.

A transformative summer,"Living indoors, connected to a screen, it’s easy for the months and years to blur together.
The seasons used to matter more.
But for young adults, they still do. Transitions are built around the seasons, and the headlong rush to a career is still sometimes interrupted by months where there’s a chance to reset and to grow.
If you know someone who’s a few months away from one of these in-between summers, I hope you’ll forward this to them.
While it’s tempting to see a summer as a break, simply a chance to rest up and recharge, the ones we end up remembering and treasuring are the foundational ones. The projects that changed us, largely because we helped someone else grow, because we built something or became something or did something worth our effort.
I’m helping my friends up north recruit and train a few instructors and staff for the summer.Click here for the details.

AI is here now, and the pace is astonishing. So far, I haven’t seen many freelancers or small businesspeople choosing to make an impact by understanding what it can do and selling processes and services to bigger organizations in ways that dramatically change how they do business.

Queued,"It’s sort of the opposite of “cued.”
In addition to being delightful to spell, the idea of work that’s queued up is energizing. The chapter ahead of schedule, the process in place for the next quarter, the continued commitment to learning…
It is locked, loaded and ready to go. It’s work that requires timing and foresight, and it’s an asset.
Knowing that it’s ready and waiting gives you the leverage and confidence to work on the next thing.

Spire confusion,"When architects show off their work, or propose a bold new building complex or even ask for a zoning variance, the public sees the external photos. The tall spire, the innovative use of glass, the weird hole in the center of the building.
And when a car company shows off a new model at a press conference, it’s the headlights or the door handles that catch our attention.
And colleges brag about their football teams…
But the thing is, most of the time the building serves its function for the people working inside of it. The owner of the car can’t see the headlights, and almost all the benefits of college have zero to do with what happens for two hours on Saturday.

When a new technology comes out, describe the scam that the founders are running. Highlight how it will cost us all our jobs, create untold new problems and definitely not work.

Make or buy?,"If you’re a writer, it probably doesn’t pay to chop down trees and make your own paper, or even to set up a little machine shop to make your own pens. That’s pretty obvious.
Should the smoothie shop make its own almond milk?
It’s pretty clear that Starbucks should have a team of architects, lawyers and graphic artists on staff, but does it pay for them to make their own cups?
Ford makes engines but they don’t make tires.
The theory of the firm was first written about by Ronald Coase nearly a hundred years ago, and the questions persist.
Consider:
Is there a reliable way for you to purchase the inputs as a commodity, where you have more power than the suppliers do?
Does buying a commodity input free you up to focus on something your customers value instead?
In the case of Ford, there are plenty of companies that are in the tire-making business, and the amount of customer-facing innovation in that industry is low. Since Ford can shop around for tires each year, and since customers don’t care very much, it makes little sense for Ford to make tires.
On the other hand, Apple discovered that there were very few companies that were competing for their chip business, and customers did indeed care about whether or not a laptop would be faster, cooler and cheaper. Rather than allowing a chip company to dominate their future, they set up their own.
If you’re a soloist, you only have a dozen hours a day (tops) to work on your project. How many of those hours are spent replicating something you could buy, the way Ford buys tires?","February 19, 2024","make or buy, outsourcing, efficiency"

If it’s not solvable, we’ll pretend it’s not a problem.
If the cultural cost of solving the problem is too high, we’ll pretend there’s no solution.
People don’t spend a lot of time planning for death because there’s no solution to it and the social costs of bringing it up are scary. It’s easier to not talk about it.

Trading trust,"The Brookings Institution did a fascinatingsurveyseries over the last five years.
I have two takeways from this:
The first is that focused and persistent propaganda is able to shift public opinion about institutions they don’t have direct interaction with.
The more important one is this: Many companies, particularly tech ones, are deliberately trading trust for short-term profits.
Amazon and many other companies went from investing heavily in being reliable, trustworthy and fair to taking persistent steps to trade these valuable assets for quarterly results. It’s worth being clear about this–they did this intentionally. They decided that the confidence consumers had placed in them wasn’t worth as much as the shortcuts they could take to increase profits instead.
While the survey focuses on widely known, large institutions, the same could be said for the local pizzeria.
Once you burn some trust, it’s almost impossible to earn it back. It took Harvard 400 years to become Harvard, Google about twenty to earn its position. This is the opportunity you’ve been waiting for–to become the one that earns the benefit of the doubt.

Peak infrastructure,"Community resources are easy to take for granted.
Unevenly distributed, they’re the sort of thing we miss only when they’re gone. Invisible things are easy to ignore.
I was stunned to see a sign in Connecticut that listed the names of dozens of highway workers who had been killed in accidents while doing their jobs. Too often, we celebrate the rabble rousers or innovators, without acknowledging our investments and efforts to keep things working.
But everything we’ve built has been built on top of our community commitments to infrastructure.
I’m lucky to have access to things like:
Few people worldwide have as much access to these resources, and one of the unsung stories of the last century has been the spread of civil systems to more and more people.
A combination of aging systems, decreased commitment to community spending and the disruptions we’re causing to the climate mean that it’s possible we’ll end up with holes in this infrastructure that we might not be able to easily fix.

Customer satisfaction and tipping,"In North America, tipping is an unfair system built into the status quo by law. Restaurants aren’t allowed to easily spread tips around, and as a result, they tend to to exacerbate many of the inequities in our culture at the same time that they make it hard to count on a fair wage in one of the largest industries in the world.
That said, one reason for the stickiness of tipping is that the act of doing it offers benefits to the customers.
The first is ritual. It’s what we grew up doing, and leaving it out feels awkward.
The second is control. The person leaving a tip is given a vivid reminder of their power as a customer. “To insure prompt service” might not be the origin of the term, but it can feel that way. It gives the customer a sense of control.
Another is status. At fancy restaurants in New York, experiments with eliminating tipping have had little success, and one reason is that regular customers enjoyed the way it allowed them to subtly (not that subtly) demonstrate their status to their guests.
A recent one is the labeling and sorting of the internet. Restaurants and resorts that include gratuities in their fees get hammered in search, because they seem more expensive than they are.
Part of the persistence of cultural norms comes from our desire for there to be a norm. When two people split a check, it’s not unusual for them to compare how much they’re leaving in a tip. Why? After all, people don’t walk across a restaurant to ask a stranger to be sure they’re in sync. But giving the ‘right’ amount, or perhaps just a bit over or just bit under is part of our desire to establish our place in a hierarchy.
How to cut this knot? If tipping is a service (for customers or staff) how to make it more than an afterthought?
If the goal is to keep tipping, then we have the chance to create the conditions where the tipper feels really good about the practice. Simple cues, an easy way to find oneself in the hierarchy, a way to know you’re tipping the ‘right amount.’ Or perhaps the sort of signaling that we see in nightclubs when someone orders a really expensive bottle for the table–how do we give customers the chance to put a show about their tipping in a way that benefits the customer as well as the server?
On the other hand, if the goal is to eliminate tipping, different stategies can be put to work.
Imagine a resort that prides itself on service. Instead of asking for a tip the last day, a note might say, “Thanks for joining us, and supporting our mission in creating a magical place to work and visit. We’ve already charged your card, which includes a hospitality fee. If anyone on the property contributed to the quality of your stay, please let us know and we’ll make sure to celebrate their work.”
Service is at the heart of our economy now. Perhaps it’s worth rethinking how we recognize it and pay for it.","February 14, 2024","tipping, customer satisfaction, service economy"
The four cohorts of the status quo,"The first group cares about the policy. They benefit from it. They’ve organized themselves around it.
The second group cares about stability. They have limited bandwidth, and they’re not particularly interested in reconsidering everything, all the time.
The third group doesn’t care that much.
And the fourth group is harmed by the policy, either directly or indirectly.
Change happens slowly because the first three groups have power, inertia and communications on their side.
Change happens when the fourth group can create the conditions for the third group to care, and then these two groups move the urgency up the agenda.
It makes no sense to argue with the first group.","February 13, 2024","Cohorts, Policy, Change"
To be well published,"Sooner or later, we benefit from being well-published.
Publishing has nothing to do with printing. It’s the act of taking risks to bring a new idea to people who want to embrace it.
It’s the head of the lab who works behind the scenes to be sure the talented scientist gets a gig at the right conference. Her talk propels the work forward.
It’s Bill Graham ‘publishing’ the Grateful Dead on stage at the Fillmore.
It’s Jean Feiwel orchestrating the bookstore success of Harry Potter…
Being well-published doesn’t guarantee that an idea or an individual will succeed. Instead, it creates the conditions to maximize the chances that the work will spread. It often involves:
Generous enthusiasm: In the moments when the marketplace hasn’t yet embraced the work, the publisher is a vital bridge between now and later.
Extraordinary logistics: It’s the tech crew that has read the rider, the operations team that makes sure the printing is done right and the strategic insight to prioritize the parts that matter.
Insightful provocation: The publisher knows the territory, and can encourage and amplify work that’s in sync with what the market will respond to.
A focus on distribution: If the work isn’t in the right place at the right time, it has no chance to thrive.
Resilience and investment: Few ideas work the first time they’re exposed to the audience. Resilience is the willingness and ability to try again, and investment represents the resources to do it well.
Just because something succeeds doesn’t mean it’s well-published, but well-published work has a better chance to succeed.
The people behind a well-published work rarely get the credit they deserve. It’s difficult and requires persistence and care.","February 12, 2024","Publishing, Success, Distribution"

Transitions are difficult,"They’re risky (unknown territory leads to unforeseen outcomes) and a very recent phenomenon. A kid dropped off at pre-school, a new boss, a food you’re not familiar with. None of this was common for most of pre-history.
When the transition occurs, we’re tempted to direct our anxiety at the details of the new situation. The boss is a close talker, the air in this new place is humid, the appetizers aren’t quite right and our guests are almost here…
It’s productive to name the actual cause instead. Time spent on the details won’t do a thing to make the transition easier.
Instead, when we address the actual issue, when we name the fact that it’s the transition that’s bothering us, we can get back to the reason we’re transitioning in the first place.","February 10, 2024","Transitions, Anxiety, Change"
Understanding free software,"A cup of coffee costs far more than a glass of water.
That’s true even though we can’t live without water. (Most) people can live without coffee.
It’s true even though creating the infrastructure to purify and deliver clean water costs billions of dollars.
The critical reason for the difference is marginal cost.
To deliver one more glass of water costs the town virtually nothing. Less than a penny.
To deliver one more cup of coffee, though, requires more beans, more roasting, more electricity, more cups, more oats, more cows, more staff… add it all up, and Starbucks couldn’t possibly profit from selling coffee for a nickel a cup.
The first thing to understand about free software is that themarginal costof one more email, one more download, one more bit is vanishingly low, close to zero.
Given the low incremental cost of another user, it’s likely that if that were the only factor, most software wouldn’t be a very good business, because it costs a lot to develop but market forces would keep pushing the price low.
The second factor islock-in. Unlike coffee, software rewards users who stick with it. Over time, the software you use becomes more familiar, it opens the files you created yesterday and it becomes harder and harder to switch. As a result, companies that make software work to create the conditions where people are encouraged to start right now, and only later discover that it’s difficult to switch.
But the real miracle of modern software is thenetwork effect. Simply put: the software works better for each user when other people use it too. The network effect dramatically rewards head starts. You want to use the same word processor as your peers, because opening their files is part of your job. You want to be on the same phone system, the same social network, the same protocols.
Sometimes, software is built in community, by teams, and often called open source. These projects exist to solve a problem and serve the user. But sometimes, software is a business.
A community-built open-source project can thrive on free. But software can also do a lot of good work when the software creates enough value that people will choose to pay for it.
And a business-led software project has similar choices to make.
And when all three pieces come together, we’re left with two extremes most software businesses face:
For a business, then, there’s the path of free or nearly free, with the goal of making money some other way, or the path of expensive, which aligns the company’s decisions with those of its users.
And for community-driven software, there’s the magic alignment that comes from open source.
There’s not an obvious answer, but there is a clear choice to be made.","February 9, 2024","Free software, marginal cost, network effect"

The pitfall of Big Game thinking,"In the US, [next Sunday] is a major holiday. The Superb Owl, with nachos, commercials and beer. People who don’t even watch football watch this game, and it’s one of the largest audiences each year on TV.
For a certain kind of mass marketer, a Super Bowl ad has been the gold standard for 40 years, ever since Lee Clow and Jay Chiat did the original Mac ad. As a result of advertiser demand, the per-viewer cost of running an ad for this mass audience is actuallymorethan it would cost to run targeted ads at only the people you actually want to reach.
To put this clearly: advertisers are paying extra to reach people who don’t care and won’t take action.
Because it’s big. Super. Easy.
A few brands can actually justify these ads with results. They make beer and chips. For just about everyone else, mass isn’t your friend. Mass means average, and the average person isn’t ready to sign up, talk about it or switch. That’s because change always happens at the edges.
The same thinking drives companies to advertise on the biggest podcasts, exhibit at the biggest trade shows and hire at the biggest colleges. Not because it’s effective, but because there’s a crowd.
The pitfall of Big Game thinking is our lack of focus. We are distracted by what others are doing, have decided is important or chosen to value, instead of doing the rewarding work of focusing on the change we seek to make.

Two chicken jokes,"“Why did the chicken cross the road” tells us a bit about jokes. It’s a joke about jokes. The first half is a setup, reminding us that an absurd question creates tension, which is then relieved by the punchline.
But the second half undoes this by refusing to release the tension. “To get to the other side” is banal. There’s no point to this Q&A. And so we sit, empty, unsure about what happens next. The absence of a punchline reminds us of how much we care about punchlines.
On the other hand, “which came first, the chicken or the egg,” isn’t a joke at all. Instead, it’s a false paradox based on a misunderstanding of Darwinian evolution and taxonomy. The only thing that can be born from a chicken egg is a chicken, whereas something that’s almost a chicken could lay a chicken egg. In fact, that’s how we got chickens in the first place. The egg came first.
But that’s not the reason for the question. The question exists to create instability, to cause us tension as we seek to find our footing in the face of an infinite loop.

Niching up,"Along the way, folks have talked about “niching down” as a way to help a project find focus.
But that’s backward.
When we identify and embrace the smallest viable audience, we’re moving up. Up the quality hierarchy. Up in responsibility. Up in the likelihood that we’ll make an impact.
To niche up, identify the smallest group of people that would be enough to sustain the project. That group, the group you get to choose, what do they have in common? What do they want? What would they miss if it disappeared…
This puts us on the hook, because if they don’t like it, the work needs to be improved.
And it gives us the foundation to kindly recommend alternatives to people who aren’t in our group. Instead of hustling for more, we’re focusing for better.

Shields down,"Michael Lopp helpedcoinan important term. When you’re a skilled craftsperson with high market value, there may be recruiters knocking on your door. An employee who has ‘shields up’ doesn’t even bother to answer the door. When shields are down, you’re open to at least hearing what’s on offer.
In a follow-uppostwhere he offered silkscreened shirts with your shield status as a fundraiser, he said that it might not be a good idea to actually wear the shirt to work.
That’s almost as fascinating as the shields up phenomenon.
There are good reasons to go shields up. It saves you a lot of filtering time. It increases job satisfaction because you’re not always comparing the reality of today with the imagined perfection of tomorrow somewhere else. And it creates a better relationship with your colleagues, because mutual commitment leads to trust.
And there are good reasons to put your shields down. You owe a debt to tomorrow–to use it in the best way you can. Too often, we let Resistance hold us back, instead of taking a hard look at what’s possible.
Why not share your status?
Tom Peters used to write about leaders who ran resumé sessions for their employees. Skeptics asked why on earth you would encourage your team to understand and demonstrate their value in the job market. He pointed out that it was better to work with people who wanted to stay, when the alternative is working with people who believe they’re stuck where they are.
There’s a long-time tension between the factory owner and the worker. The factory owner wants to take the maximum amount of labor in exchange the lowest amount of compensation. The worker often responds by playing defense and not letting the boss disrespect them.
Bosses invented employee loyalty, not employees.
The fear, if you wear your shields up shirt, is that your boss will ask for more. And that if you wear your shields down shirt, your boss will stop trusting you and start scheming to replace you.
Perhaps there’s an alternative:
The boss should act as if everyone has shields down. Assume you need to re-earn engagement and loyalty every day by offering respect, significance and interesting opportunities.
And the employees could act as if they have shields up, simply because it’s a powerful way to spend your day in flow. You can always change your mind tomorrow.","March 27, 2024","shields, employee engagement, trust"
The drift to normal,"As an organization grows in scale, the idiosyncrasy and distinctiveness that was originally informed by the taste of the founders moves toward the mean.
Over time, things get more average.
That’s because each new customer, each new supplier and each new employee wants or needs something a little more normal, at least sometimes. The drift to normal can only be countered by persistent effort, usually at the cost of some element of short-term scale.

Explaining yourself,"The only reason we need to go into detail about our resume, the details of our new idea or the features of a product is to cause action to happen.

Velocity and possibility,"The art of project management includes the dance between velocity and possibility.
If you describe the outcome with specificity and remove as many variables as possible, you’ll get the work done with more speed, higher reliability and less cost.
That velocity, though, might encourage us to recognize that all sorts of options are available. There are countless chances to make the project better and to find new opportunities.
Exploring the possibilities in moments of high velocity almost certainly ensures that costs will increase, reliability will be impacted and you’ll miss deadlines.
That’s because possibility is the art of being willing to be wrong. It’s exploration. It’s far easier to explore on foot than it is on a high-speed train.
The best time to explore isbeforeyou scale your investments, your commitments and the size of the team.

The rock star conundrum,"Forty years ago, the royalty of rock spent the night in a studio to record one of the fastest-selling singles of all time. Thedocumentaryof the event is just okay, but it’s fascinating in how it shows us just how deep imposter syndrome lies.
Only a few stars seemed at all comfortable–Stevie Wonder and Diana Ross. On the other hand, Waylon Jennings felt excluded and stormed out halfway through. Huey Lewis said his legs were shaking. Some notable stars were too afraid to come at all. And Bob Dylan, the same guy who won the Nobel Prize, seems profoundly insecure the entire time, and it’s only when Stevie and Quincy Jones give him some reassurance that he’s finally able to sing at all.
We’d like to believe that if we only had the adulation, market success, and fan support of superstars like these,thenwe’d finally be comfortable and able to do our best.

The worst person on our team,"A common shortcut to cultural divisiveness is to find the single worst person in a different group and highlight and attack their behavior.
By making it clear and obvious that this is what THEY (the plural) want and who THEY are, it’s easy to walk away from a largerwe. Their worst troll becomes their mascot.
And in a media-fueled culture that thrives on division, this is a convenient shortcut.
What happens, though, if we find the worst person onourteam and tell them to chill out a bit. That people like us don’t do things like that. That their trollish, extreme behavior is magnifying differences instead of making it more likely we end up with useful cultural cohesion…
It’s surprising how much the outlier is willing to listen to the very people they’re counting on for support. And the folks you seek to win over are much more likely to give you the benefit of the doubt if you have a history of discouraging bad behavior.

Naming is part of marketing,"A name is a hook for us to hang a story on.
We need to begin with empathy and a useful story… useful to the people who want to believe it, spread it, and use it to accomplish their goals.
But then, the story needs firm footing and a way to stick with us. Patagonia is a great name because while most people have no idea where the place known as Patagonia is, they’re able to associate it with the story that the company has been telling for a long time. Nike is a great name, even though it’s not obvious how to pronounce it. Genghis Khan had a memorable, unique name–you don’t have to be beloved for the name to be useful.
The industry that’s the current world champ at bad naming is AI.
ChatGPT is a terrible name. And the trademark office in the US just denied them ownership in GPT, so even if they were a pioneer, that’s gone now. It’s hard to tell the story when you don’t know what to call it.

Curation (vs the road to junk),"The independent bookstore down the street is carefully curated. Each book takes up the spot that a different book could inhabit, so the owner makes sure that there’s a great reason a title is included.
Amazon, on the other hand, has no shelf space problem, and the Kindle multiplies it. As a result, the average book on the Kindle is virtually worthless, because once it’s easy to include everything, everything gets included. Amazon doesn’t promise to curate, they insist the purchaser does.
Christopher Nolan hasn’t made many movies (and has carefully kept his first student film hidden from view). If he puts his name on it, people pay attention.
YouTube has countless (actually countless, because new ones arrive faster than you can count the old ones) videos. And a significant number of them have less than ten views, and they don’t even deserve that many.  YouTube doesn’t curate, they encourage the crowd to do that for them.
The long tail is a business model and a way of bringing work to the world. More is better.

Hiding the ‘aha’,"The most effective persuasion happens when we persuade ourselves.
The purpose of the memo or the table or the graph or the presentation is to create the conditions for someone to make up their own minds. Because it’s almost impossible to make up their mind for them.
The aha is actually a chemical reaction, a rewiring of our brain, the moment when we see what we hadn’t seen before and make a new decision based on what we believe to be new information.
Causing an aha requires insight and elegance, and there are three ways we avoid it.
Sometimes, we are entranced by our own insight, or impressed with our communication tools. We let facts, formatting and filigree get in the way of a good story.
And sometimes, we’re afraid of our power, so we bury the lede too far, letting ourselves off the hook by not influencing someone else.
Once in a while, we do the opposite. We say what we mean so clearly and so directly that the story disappears and the facts bounce off the inertia and self esteem of the person encountering them.

The positive auction,"[Sorry, I hit publish prematurely. I’ll be updating this and correcting the errors as we go.]
In 2023, I developed a new idea that transforms an old way of doing commerce.
In traditional auctions, there are rounds of bidding and the high bidder pays to get the prize. The last bid is the amount paid, and no one else is charged anything.
This is an interesting ‘game’ in which all participants are able to express their desire for the item in monetary terms. In an efficient auction, the price paid will represent the highest utility among the bidders, with no one feeling remorse–including the seller–because the “market has spoken.”
Over time, these sorts of auctions aren’t actually as efficient as they seem. This is why other times of auctions have evolved. These include:
The three other common types of auctions are (via Wikipedia):
When bidders have an understanding of the nature of the bidders in the room as well as their options, bidding is skewed. For things like spectrum, this can cost the seller billions of dollars.
I chose to address the problem of charity auctions. Often run at galas, they depend on a combination of status and alcohol to generate high bids for items that the buyers might not have imagined wanting to purchase before the event began. As a result, the results are often quite disappointing to the seller, often a worthy cause.
The positive auction transforms the dynamics of a charity auction by changing two elements:
Most profoundly, every bid is a donation.
Bidding begins at $10 and increments by ten dollars per bid. Bidders are not permitted to skip a step.
The total raised increases exponentially.
Specifically
S=(n/2)​(2a+(n−1)d)
S is the final sum. a is the first number and d is the increment.
In practice, then, the bidding results look like this:
The organizer of the auction can offer free bids to bidders at no cost to the seller. In fact, free bids can actually increase the amount raised.
The second innovation is incorporating “free bids” into the auction.
For example, a free bid could be rewarded to anyone who recruits someone who bids in an auction. When used, the free bid ratchets up the auction, meaning that the next bid will be higher. Even if a free bidder wins the auction, they haven’t decreased the amount of money raised.
In practice, a positive auction creates an unstable equilibrium. If we consider an auction with 150 bids, the winner pays only $1,495 but gets an item that might be worth $100,000. It’s difficult to look away from this gap without exploring it.
We’re taking the dynamics of positive auctions and building GOODBIDS around it, providing a tool for worthy causes to raise money.
Positive auctions paper (via Claude.ai):Abstract:This paper introduces a novel auction format, the positive auction, designed to address the inefficiencies and suboptimal outcomes often associated with traditional charity auctions. By incorporating two key innovations—treating every bid as a donation and introducing free bids—the positive auction model aims to increase total funds raised for charitable causes while maintaining an engaging and competitive bidding environment.1. IntroductionCharity auctions play a vital role in generating funds for worthy causes. However, traditional auction formats often fail to maximize the potential for fundraising, as they rely heavily on factors such as status and impulsive bidding behavior. This paper presents the positive auction model, a transformative approach to charity auctions that seeks to address these shortcomings and optimize the fundraising process.2. The Positive Auction Model2.1 Every Bid as a DonationThe core principle of the positive auction is that every bid placed by a participant constitutes a donation to the charitable cause. Bidding commences at a fixed starting price and increases by a predetermined increment with each subsequent bid. Participants are required to follow the incremental bidding sequence, ensuring a structured and transparent process.The total funds raised through a positive auction can be calculated using the following formula:_S_\=(n/2)​(2_a_+(_n_−1)_d_)Where:_S_ = total sum raised_n_ = number of bids_a_ = starting bid amount_d_ = bid incrementThis formula demonstrates the exponential growth potential of the positive auction model, with total funds raised increasing significantly as the number of bids grows.2.2 Free BidsThe positive auction introduces the concept of “free bids” to further enhance the fundraising potential. Free bids are awarded to participants based on predefined criteria, such as recruiting additional bidders to the auction. These free bids serve to increase the overall number of bids placed, driving up the total funds raised without any additional cost to the charitable organization.3. Unstable Equilibrium and IncentivesThe positive auction creates an unstable equilibrium, where the winning bidder may secure an item of substantial value for a relatively low final bid price. This disparity between the item’s perceived value and the winning bid price serves as a powerful incentive for participants to continue bidding, as the potential for securing a high-value item at a bargain price is a compelling prospect.4. Practical Application: GOODBIDSThe positive auction model has been implemented through the development of GOODBIDS, a platform designed to facilitate fundraising for charitable causes. By providing a user-friendly interface and automating the bidding process, GOODBIDS aims to make the positive auction model accessible to a wide range of organizations and individuals seeking to maximize their fundraising efforts.5. ConclusionThe positive auction model represents a significant advancement in the field of charity auctions, offering a novel approach to maximizing fundraising potential while maintaining an engaging and competitive bidding environment. By treating every bid as a donation and introducing the concept of free bids, the positive auction creates an unstable equilibrium that incentivizes participants to continue bidding, ultimately leading to increased funds raised for worthy causes. The development of platforms like GOODBIDS further enhances the practical application of this innovative auction format, promising to revolutionize the landscape of charitable fundraising.","March 5, 2024","Positive auction, charity fundraising, GOODBIDS"

The question book,"In the old days, companies had a suggestion box. It was immortalized in cartoons, but the idea that an employee could anonymously submit a suggestion to make things better is a first step in engagement. Some companies took this much further and paid employees for suggestions that generated profits.
Digital communication and more open workplaces have made the necessity for a box like this decrease. But we’re still often hung up on the odd cultural stigma around seeming dumb. So people don’t raise their hands, don’t ask questions and work in frustration and ignorance instead.
Something we learn as teenagers.
Perhaps we can begin with a teenager-focused solution. When your kid turns 12, give them a blank notebook. “Any time you have a question that’s embarrassing or you’re not sure who to ask, just write it down in this notebook and put it on my bed. I’ll write out an answer and return it the next day.”

Inverting the vex,"Life can be irritating.
And sometimes, we can make a choice.
The thing that’s vexing you: is it a situation or a problem?
Problems have solutions. If we care enough, we can find a way to solve a problem, but it might cost more money, require more effort or involve more risk than we’d prefer. If we’re ready to ease some of the constraints, that problem might go away.
Situations don’t have solutions. That’s why we don’t call them problems. There might be constraints we are not prepared to confront, or the structure of the situation may simply make it impossible to change.
If a problem is vexing us, we can use that irritation as fuel, finding the energy to deal with it. We can turn the moment into curiosity and forward motion.
And if it’s a situation? Then being vexed is a choice. If it’s helping you to be irritated, enjoy it. If not, then why bother?

The Net Promoter Score,"More than two-thirds of the companies surveyed said that they used NPS methodology with their customers. Some are using it to measure employee satisfaction as well.
The P stands for ‘promoter’, but of course, it doesn’t actually measure promotion.

Being liked is important. Trust, comfort and delight are useful things to strive for.
Liked doesn’t get you promoted, though. People promote a brand or activity when it increases their status or the affiliation they have with others, not because they owe you something.

Different overhead… the investments that help you and your product or service become better for your customers. When you pay rent in a neighborhood that makes it easier for people to get to you, that rent increases your appeal.
Indifferent overheadis just as it sounds–the money you’re spending that isn’t noticed by the people you serve.
A direct way to create the freedom you need to do the work you want to do is to make your indifferent overhead as low as you possibly can. If the customers don’t care, perhaps we shouldn’t either.","April 28, 2024","overhead, indifferent overhead, business expenses"
"Manipulation, indoctrination and addiction","They’re often related.
It’s not unusual for someone to have more experience or knowledge than we do. If they use that knowledge to their benefit, not ours, they might be manipulating us. If we knew what they knew, we wouldn’t have gone along. This is the difference between a generous teacher and a hustler.
Indoctrination is the repeated effort to get people to believe something, often something that’s not useful or correct. It starts early, it’s repeated and it’s built into the culture. When peer pressure is added to manipulation, we often end up with indoctrination into systems of belief that aren’t helpful.
Learning to thrive in a resilient culture is essential. Being indoctrinated into a rigid and fragile mindset is not.
And addiction is often sold to us. It’s a shortcut to profit and power for many. Ingrained habits that fuel businesses or movements are designed to be sticky manipulations. Better for them than for you.
The easiest way to deal with any of the three is to avoid them. The hard part is that once they begin, they create the conditions where it’s ever more difficult to stop.

There were more than 450,000 new titles issued last year according toBookscan. A title is a book in a specific format–so the audio counts as separate from the hardcover, etc. To be conservative, you can triple the sales numbers here, to account for digital and audio formats of the same title.
If we narrow that down to the 45,000 books published by the largest publishers—books that by every definition are not self-published, and that required a team to create—we get thischart(click to enlarge):
Only 163 books sold more than 100,000 copies. That’s fewer than one out of every 250 titles published.
That’s a pretty low bar: 100,000 is the population of Roanoke, Virginia.
If we halve that goal, we only add another 320 books. This means that every time the smartest minds in book publishing spend time, money and effort to publish 900 books,oneof them approaches the status of a hit.
(And in this case, a hit is simply one book for every person in Pocatello, Idaho.)
You could open a bookstore that carries every current hit in every format and you’d only need a few bookcases.
On the other end of the scale, we see that 85% of all traditional books published last year sold fewer than 5,000 copies each in their format. Those are extraordinarily bad odds.
Books matter. Making them is a combination of craft and insight. Publishing them is a generous act of faith. Adding to the corpus of shared knowledge is important. Books change the culture when people act on them, even if they don’t sell many copies. And sometimes the backlist surprises the accountants.
But the economics of new books have nothing to do with any of these benefits. Scarcity made the book publishing world work as a business, and scarcity is gone.
Write a book because you can and because it might make a difference. But don’t listen to your publisher’s suggestions simply to sell more copies. You probably won’t.","April 26, 2024","book sales, publishing, long tail"
Bottom of the funnel,"It’s easy to get focused on the public-facing mouth of the funnel.
More followers.
More impressions.
More buzz, hype, promotion. Get the word out.
Just about all the time people who call themselves “marketers” spend is on this. Don’t worry about what happens later, just pour more attention into the top.
But the math is simple:
Most of the people at the top leave long before they engage, buy or spread the word.
Which means that doubling your conversion is exactly the same as doubling the number of people who are aware of you.
It means that by the time you get to 20 people (out of 1,000) who are ready to become committed fans, each of these people is worth fifty times as much effort as you’d put into getting one new stranger to be aware of what you do.

“What’s the catch?”,"It’s an important question. Lots of opportunities come with one, and going in with your eyes open helps avoid problems later.
Two challenges:
Sometimes, a really good opportunity doesn’t actually have a catch. And spending a lot of time looking for one keeps us from the work we ought to be doing.
And sometimes, a really exciting opportunity is so exciting we forget to look. And we should.","April 24, 2024","opportunities, challenges, awareness"
Generational shifts in punditry,"In 1970, when Walter Cronkite was narrating current events for the United States, he was 54 years old. Hitchcock made his last film when he was 77.
When there’s a limited number of slots for narrators to fill, they can stick around for a long time.
One of the overlooked cultural shifts of our time is that by dramatically expanding the number of slots (and removing the gatekeepers) we skipped twenty or thirty years. Now, there are writers, pundits, video stars and producers who aren’t being asked to wait two decades to have a voice.
Existing media (like traditional book publishing or network TV) will hold on to proven voices for as long as it can, but new media (which now captures far more attention) has no mechanism for that.
If it seems like it’s happening all at once, compared to history, it is.

What happened vs. what we do about it,"It’s possible to have a useful conversation about what to do about something that’s broken or needs improvement. But first, we must acknowledge that it happened.
It’s not controversial to understand the facts, the data and the shifts that are happening in the world we live in. In fact, the only way to have a useful conversation about what to do about it is to understand and accept the reality of what’s here.
Movements that deny reality choose to do this because they don’t have a better plan, and stalling is their best option. Which is no option at all.
Today is Earth Day, which like Mother’s Day, shouldn’t be a day at all, more like an all-year-round celebration.
Two years ago, hundreds of volunteers from 90 countries came together and produced anAlmanac.
Since then, the book has been translated into languages around the world (recently with a free edition inSpanish), been a bestseller from China to Italy to the Netherlands, and remained in the top 100 in its category in the US.
And yet, it’s possible that you haven’t seen it yet, that your kids aren’t using it in school, that it’s not being handed out at community meetings or required reading at organizations large and small. Today would be a great day to share a copy.

Other people’s problems,"It’s surprisingly easy to be generous and find solutions to our friend’s problems.
Much easier than it is to do it for ourselves. Why?
There are two useful reasons, I think.
FIRST, because we’re unaware of all the real and imaginary boundaries our friends have set up. If it were easy to solve the problem, they probably would have. But they’re making it hard because they have decided that there are people or systems that aren’t worth challenging. Loosening the constraints always makes a problem easier to solve.
And SECOND, because resistance is real. Solving the problem means moving ahead, confronting new, even scarier problems. It might be easier to simply stay where we are, marinating in our stuck.
When we care enough to solve our own problem, we’ll loosen the unloosenable constraints and embrace the new challenges to come.","April 21, 2024","Generosity, Constraints, Resistance"
ChatGPT is dumber than it looks,"That’s not true for a screwdriver.
Or a table saw or even a spatula.
These are useful tools, but they don’t pretend to be well-informed or wise. They’re dumb, and they look dumb too.
That’s one reason that tools are effective. We use them to leverage our effort, but we don’t trust them to do things that they’re not good at.
The reason AI language models are dumb is that they don’t actually know anything, the model is simply calculating probabilities. Not about the unknown, but abouteverything. Each word, each sentence, is a statistical guess.
I’ve switched mostly toclaude.aibecause it’s more effective and less arrogant, but it’s still guessing.
If a guess is good enough, you’re set. If it’s not, plan accordingly.

The grid of inquiry,"Expertise and firmly held beliefs don’t always go together.
Here’s a simple XY grid to help us choose where to sit at whatever table we’re invited to:
Plenty of well-trainedprofessionalshave earned the right to have strongly held beliefs. These convictions save them time and error, particularly if the world is stable. Surgeons, jugglers and historians make countless decisions, and they rarely have the time or resources to reconsider each underlying factor. This makes them efficient, but can also cause a field to get stuck.
Fortunately, there areinnovators. These are individuals with plenty of experience and training who have chosen to be flexible, to repeatedly ask ‘what if’ and ‘why’. When an innovator suggests a counter-intuitive or even nutty concept, it might pay to listen carefully.
For most of us, most of the time, we have the chance to becurious. We don’t have a lot of domain knowledge, but we’re able to ask intelligent questions and to listen carefully to the answers. The hallmark of a curious person with goodwill is that they’re eager to change their minds.
Alas, social media has elevated thefoolish. People possessing little in the way of expertise, and generally unwilling to change their assertions or goals.

"Dreams, plans and contradictions","Dreams are fine. And dreams involve contradictions. We want this AND that, but both can’t happen. That’s what keeps them from being plans.
Plans embrace boundaries and reality, they don’t ignore them. Plans thrive on scarcity and constraints. Plans are open for inspection, and a successful planner looks forward to altering the plans to make them more likely to become real.","April 18, 2024","Dreams, Plans, Contradictions"
The blank page,"Sometimes, we’re so afraid of creation that we don’t even leave blank pages around.
If your workspace has a hole exactly the size of a creative idea in it, you’re more likely to fill the hole.
When we decrease the number of steps to begin creating, and increase the expectation that something is going to arrive, it’s far more likely to happen.
Book a recording studio. Leave the laptop open. Schedule a blog post. Make sure the whiteboard can be seen. Buy more blank canvasses than you need.

Refusing the salon of the refused,"This week is the 150th anniversary of the most important failed art exhibit of all time.
It was organized by and featured artists who weren’t even among those that had a slot at the runner’s up exhibit for artists who weren’t featured in therealSalon in Paris. Manet didn’t have the guts to join them, so he participated in the ‘Refused’ exhibit. The others understood that a real change was possible.
Monet, Renoir, Sisley, Degas, Berthe Morisot, Pissarro, Béliard, Guillaumin, Lepic, Levert, and Rourt all participated. They not only put their art in the show, they organized and paid for it.
A few lessons worth taking away:
The first exhibit was a financial and critical failure. The show received fewer than 1% of the number of visitors that the mainstream salon benefitted from, and there were few reviews, most of them negative.
They knew someone who had a building, and the empty space he offered them was enough of an instigator that it turned some maybes into yesses. Use it or lose it.
One of the most positive things to come from the exhibit was a scathing satirical piece, the one that gave the impressionists their name. The insecure critics came to regret their inability to see what was possible.
And yet, the artists persisted. Year after year, eight times, gaining momentum each time, they returned, working their way from outsiders to become the dominant form of artistic expression of their time.
But most of all, so much easier today than in Paris 150 years ago, these individual painters did two things:They picked themselves and they did it together.
Everyone wants to be picked, but no one wants to organize the collective ‘we’.
It’s the ‘we’ that creates a school of thought, a movement, a network, a culture.
Curate, connect, organize and lead. Who better than you?

Getting the word out,"“How do you get the word out?”
I’ve heard this from presidential candidates, from small business leaders and nonprofits as well. It’s easy to believe that the goal of marketing is to shout, hype, hustle and otherwise promote.
It’s tempting to focus on your story as the top of the pyramid, and decide that your work is to share that story to everyone downstream, downwind or near you.
Hire a PR firm, run some ads, post more on social media and hype and hustle. After all, it’simportant.
But that’s not how the world works, and it hasn’t worked that way since network TV started to fade a few decades ago.
Ideas that spread win.Horizontally, not from the rooftops.
When we build something that our users want to talk about, remarkable happens. Remarkable means worth making a remark about.
This is the engine thatGOODBIDSis built for. A nonprofit uses the permission asset they’ve built with their existing donors to let them know about an auction. That’s anticipated, personal and relevant, and backers are delighted to hear about it.
And then what happens?
If the auction is interesting to friends or colleagues, the supporters happily tell the others about it. They do it to earn free bids, or they do it to help a cause they care about, or they do it because spreading the word about something interesting, worthwhile or fun feels good.
In the last four days, GOODBIDS users have shared our initial auctions with tens of thousands of people… not because someone made them do it, but because they wanted to.
Today’s auctions:
An officialNASA Apollo 11 shoulder patch, identical to the one that Armstrong wore on the moon. It comes with a signed, limited edition ofDavid Meerman Scott‘s brilliant book on the marketing of the race to the moon.
It also comes with a letter of authenticity. The patch is untouched, unflown and uncut. It will make your heart race and remind you of just how much we’re capable of when we work together with focus. Meeting Neil years ago made me cry, and I hope you’ll check this one out.

Charity auctions are an odd hybrid. They take a lot of focus, and when done live, a lot of logistical support.
It’s all of the charity’s best “customers” in a room, at the same time.
Not just in a room, but at something that’s supposed to be a party, an event that’s not only supposed to be fun and demonstrate hospitality, but one that might involve our feelings around status, insufficiency and perfection.
As a result, months are spent making sure everything is just right.Date certainhas baggage. Sign up to host live events with care.
That’s time and effort the nonprofit could be putting into engaging with donors directly. Or even in connecting donors to one another in a way that’s generative and useful.
If something goes wrong, plenty of people are triggered. And the responses have to happen with urgency.
GOODBIDSpositive auctions can bring some of the real-time energy and urgency of a fundraising event, but without the emotional or labor overhead.
Yes, the auction is happening right here and right now. Bidders can’t snooze or they miss out. The clock is ticking, but not at the expense of the hardworking folks at the nonprofit. It’s workingforthem instead.

Each of us builds culture every time we interact with anyone else. Opting out isn’t possible, all we can do is decide what sort of impact and contribution we’re each going to make.
It’s tempting to say, “they” build culture, and to see that some have far more leverage than others. But it’s actually a “we” thing.",,"Culture, Community, Impact"
The challenge of nonprofit fundraising,"When someone starts a business, they spend a bunch of time with a business plan, working to raise funds and get it off the ground. After that, though, the purpose of the business is completely aligned with the idea of not running out of money. We run a business to make money, not to spend it. If done well, there’s no more fundraising after a startup period.
On the other hand, nonprofits sign up to do at leasttwothings.
They’re here to solve a problem, to address trauma, to enrich the culture, to do the difficult work that we’re not always able to do on our own.
And yet, at the same time, we require them to raise money. Not just for a little while, butall the time.
The more successful they become, the more money they need to raise.
Along the way, it’s not unusual for a nonprofit to spend 50% of the money they raise on the expense of raising more money. That’s not becausethey’reinefficient, it’s becauseweare.
We demand a gala, or an emergency, or artfully written fundraising letters. Donors want personal attention from the folks who are ostensibly doing the front line or strategic work of the nonprofit, and treat regular donations as an exception, not the standard.
When the internet arrived, it dramatically lowered the transactional costs in a wide variety of industries. You can buy an airline ticket yourself faster and with less intervention than through a travel agent. You can buy stocks for transaction fees that are a tiny fraction of what a broker used to charge. But creative and effective nonprofit fundraising has been stuck in a cycle of risk, galas and uncertainty.
GOODBIDSis making it easier for a nonprofit to create an event that might capture the attention of regular donors as well as new ones. It still requires some effort to secure the prizes, but our tool significantly leverages the work of the nonprofit and the fee we charge the nonprofit is a tiny fraction of what it usually costs to do fundraising.

PS bonus tip: Each Goodbids auction has an end date and time, but the auction is automatically extended when someone bids near the end of the window.

Updating our stuck interactions,"There are few sitcoms, thrillers or plays where the plot can tolerate the addition of a cell phone. Once the characters have the ability to connect and clear up misunderstandings at will, a lot of tension disappears. If Juliet had had a smartphone, she and Romeo would have ended up married, living in a house in the suburbs.
And the ubiquitous meeting-in-person has a similarly long history. And yet they still happen with very few changes, with power getting the head of the table, traditionally privileged voices being the loudest and no accommodations for new information or asynchronous interactions.
Political debates are largely unchanged since Lincoln’s day. Yes, we have microphones now, but it hasn’t occurred to the organizers to use a timer and simply turn off the mic when time’s up, not to mention including real time fact checking. We still reward bullying, bloviating and dances of dominance.
Email, once the most modern form of interaction, hasn’t changed much at all since I got my first address in 1976. There are a hundred ways it could be dramatically more effective and efficient, but it’s stuck.
Weddings, high school graduations and funerals also remain similar to the way they’ve always been.
One reason these formats stick around is that they are connection devices, and we often believe that we have to stick with the status quo, because getting everyone involved to agree on a new method is too difficult. And yet, new methods do arise… but sometimes we stick with the old ones without wondering why.
Humans have been communicating and coordinating since the beginning. But in the last fifty years, we’ve transformed the tech–now we need to think hard about whether we’re sticking with something because it works, or because we always have done it that way.",,"interaction, communication, tradition"
Why tell the others?,"Every internet success works because the network effect kicked in.
There’s no other way for an idea to reliably and economically reach a big enough audience to be sustained. That’s why Super Bowl ads make so little sense in 2024.
Ideas that spread win.
I wrote a bestseller about this 20 years ago, and I still take the insight to heart.
One challenge with fundraising is that it’s awkward to share. Perhaps your friend isn’t ready to donate, or isn’t interested in the non profit… It simply doesn’t feel as easy or as fun as sharing a silly video or meme.
Also, if you’re in an auction, you probably don’t want to share it with others, because they might outbid you.
That’s where the second innovation ofGOODBIDScomes in.
Every registered user gets a unique referral link. If you share that link and someone bids, you get a free bid. In any auction you like.
The free bid can be for any amount. And if you get the reward with that free bid, it costs you nothing (and it doesn’t cost the charity anything either).
Here’s a simple example:
Today, we’re launching three cool auctions:
1-on-1 office or Zoom meeting withNicole Walters(to benefitWalkGoodLA)
Priceless guitar signed by Bob Weir(for theGrateful Guitars Foundation)
Autographed jersey from Christian McCaffreywho played in this year’s Super Bowl (for theMillion Meal Project)
A deadhead cares a lot about this guitar. A business owner would walk across hot coals to spend time with bestselling authorNicole Walters. And unlike the commercials, jerseys are actually worth something to fans.
These are worth sharing.
If you tell your friends about one of these auctions, post on Reddit or share on social media, and someone bids any amount, even $10, your special link will get a free bid added to your account.
You can use that free bid to participate in theApple Watch auctionat $350 or $550.
It works because the free bids simply ratchet the auction forward. If you get outbid, the new donor just put in $360. If you don’t, it’s still raising as much as it would have if you hadn’t used your free bid.
I’m imagining that some folks will bid early in auctions because they want to support the charity and the work they’re doing, or because they’d like to be part of something. And it’s likely that many people will eagerly spread the idea of GOODBIDS to support a charity they care about. Or because the reward is really cool and worth talking about. Or because they’d like to earn an account filled with free bids.
Now it gets fascinating. And fun.","April 11, 2024","network effect, fundraising, auctions"

Launching GOODBIDS,"Over the next few days, I’m going to feature a newprojectwe launched today. A small and mighty team has been working on this for a year. I want to share the highlights along with some of the critical design choices we made along the way
Each year, charities in the US raise about a billion dollars adayfrom individuals. That money goes to great use–for the arts, for healthcare, for education, for countless projects that benefit our communities.
Because our society hasn’t built in a passive way for these organizations to get funded, they need to actively fundraise. It’s exhausting and frankly, a grind. No one particularly wants to take risks or spend extra time being creative, since it’s a required chore, not the point.
In creatingGOODBIDS, we set out to create a new way for worthy causes to raise money, something that would be fun, remarkable and generative.
The core of the idea is the Positive Auction. While it seems a bit like an eBay auction, there are actually some extraordinary and game-changing twists.
The key is this:Every bid is a donation.
Today, we launched three auctions, with more to come all week:
The bidding starts at $10. It goes up in $10 increments and you can’t skip a step.
So, $10, $20, $30, etc.
Each bid is actually a non-refundable donation.
That means that if you bid $10 and someone outbids you at $20, your donation still goes to the charity. You get an email confirmation of your donation and peace of mind. Someone else is going to get the reward–unless you choose to bid again.
The last donation gets the reward.
The magic of a Positive Auction is in the math. If the bidding for the session with Jason goes to $1500 (far less than its value), the nonprofit will get up to $112,000 in donations.
We’re going to be launching a range of extraordinary auctions this week, all with donated prizes. I hope you’ll check them out and be sure to tune in tomorrow if you’re a Dead fan.
And here’s a sneak peek…","April 10, 2024","GOODBIDS, Positive Auction, fundraising"
Demanding certainty,"The defenders of the status quo often demand certainty when facing decisions about the future.
It sets up the conditions for doing nothing, because certainty never happens until the future arrives.
It’s much more useful to look at probabilities.
Flipping a fair coin has a 50% chance of coming up heads. That’s a risky bet.
On the other hand, there’s more than a 95% chance that the sea levels in Miami will be significantly higher in ten years. Is that a bet you want to take the other side of?
As soon as we can begin discussing probabilities, we can sit on the same side of the table and refine our estimates and our risk profiles.

Jevons paradox is not surprising,"When a resource can be used more efficiently, we end up using more of the thing, not less.
So, when cars get better gas mileage, people drive more, andconsumptioncan actually go up.
When AI learns to write computer code, the demand for programmers goesup, because more efficient code is more attractive, and we want more of it.
Household appliances that are designed to save time and trouble end up being used for more than simply maintaining the previous level of tidiness. Because it’s easier, we raise our standards for tidy and use them more as they get easier to use.

Alas, this doesn’t work unless the others do the taking and do the accepting.
Which is unlikely. We’re giving power to someone who isn’t going to use it to make our day better.
It’s far more predictable and reliable to simply take it ourselves. At least that way, we can do something with it.

Generosity and fear,"Fear is self-focused. Day to day, our fear is about us. What will happen if we give that speech, launch that project, get stuck in traffic, are eaten by an alligator…
And generosity is about others. “How can I help?”
Jumping in the water to save a struggling swimmer stops us from worrying about how we look in our suit or whether the water is cold. And if you’re worried about the customer instead of your quota, making a sales call is easier too.
The key scene at the climax of the Wizard of Oz happens when Dorothy intercedes on the scarecrow’s behalf. Once again, she finds the courage to overcome her fear when she’s generously supporting a friend.
It’s more than a shift in narrative. It’s a shift in intent.","April 2, 2024","Generosity, Fear, Intent"
Kinds of courage,"Courage is a generous act that involves risk.
It’s not courageous to hang out with friends and make a crank phone call.
The risk involved might be actual risk (it took courage to go to the moon) or it might feel risky (raising your hand at a meeting to ask a useful question probably has no real downside but it feels that way).
Too often, we get hung up on how risky it feels, and fail to focus enough on how generous the work is. Generosity is a great antidote to fear.","April 1, 2024","Courage, Generosity, Risk"
The third impossibility,"The first was radio and television. Humans around the world spending a significant portion of their waking hours consuming audio and video recordings of other people.
The second was the internet. Five to ten hours a day interacting, in real time, with other people, many of them strangers.
And the third is AI. We’re about to spend almost all of our time interacting with software that appears to have an understanding of us and the world around us. All the time, in real time.","May 31, 2024","AI, interaction, technology"
Assume goodwill,"There’s often doubt.
Giving someone the benefit of that doubt enables us to move forward, and that requires us to realize that our doubt might be unfounded.
Systems that assume goodwill create possibility, connection and utility far easier than those that don’t. Being invited to find a place in those systems is a privilege worth earning.","May 30, 2024","goodwill, benefit of the doubt, connection"
Incrementally better,"Massive leaps in utility and quality are extraordinary events. Going from ver 2.0 to 3.0 is a step change.
But that is almost never what improvement looks like.
Instead, the persistent commitment to slightly better on a regular schedule inexorably makes a difference over time.","May 29, 2024","Incremental Improvement, Consistency, Long-term Growth"
Exceed or maintain?,"In just about every group, people decide in advance how they’ll show up when it comes to learning, to winning and to responding to opportunities. They’re wearing a hat with a label, and over time, it’s not hard to recognize.
This can change based on pedagogy, social conditions and the juxtaposition of status roles, but it’s really quite sticky.
A few people are not simply autodidacts, they’re actually motivated by the journey itself. They show up early, do the training, focus on prep and learn what they can, merely because they can. This is the person who trains for a marathon and then runs one, without waiting for an organized race to happen.
The second group gets a lot of attention. They are fierce competitors–not only against their personal best, but in regards to the rest of the pack. If others in their investment bank work 10 hours a day, they’ll work 10 and a half–but when they move to a new firm, the first thing they’ll figure out is what others do.
The ‘almost win’ group are very much like the winner group, except they almost always come in third or fourth. Resistance is real, and while competition motivates them, fear or other internal limits holds them back. Some people in this group manage to whine and blame the refs or self sabotage… the external symptoms may change, but the outcomes remain.
The next group doesn’t want to be left behind. They’re willing and able to expend effort, but not too much. If they’re in a fast group, they’ll go faster, but they never see themselves as contenders.
And the last group, with no capital letters, finds satisfaction and solace in doing the least amount possible in this situation.
These hats aren’t permanent, and different people wear them in different settings. We may have been handed a hat from an early age, but ultimately, it’s a choice.

And the opposite of the lazy shortcut.
The meanings of both clauses change over time…
Play fair:

Social media and politics have done a great job of celebrating people who seek selfish shortcuts, simply because it’s entertaining or easy to believe.
Few of us do the hard work of manual labor these days. Instead, we have the chance to sign up to work hard on solving useful problems in a way that’s generative and resilient.
I hope it’s pretty clear that most of us would like to work in a culture like this. But if we don’t work at it, it disappears.

Transforming two-sided markets,"AI agents are going to overhaul the way we think about buying and selling.
Uber already did this in a small way. They organized the drivers, and now they organize the riders. Hailing a cab was already sort of anonymous, but with competition and structure, AI will continue to get better at finding the right passengers for the right drivers, and vice versa.
But there are far more markets where this sort of transformation hasn’t happened yet.
Real estate (both buying and renting) has been slightly changed by the internet. They’ve made markets a bit more efficient and given buyers more insight. But the choices people make are based on intuition, and data sets are incomplete and have more “I know it when I see it” than we’d expect from such a large and regular transaction.
What happens when the right person finds the right place to live, and the connections have value far beyond building awareness?
Tinder and other dating apps changed some of the inefficiencies of people connecting with one another as they pursue relationships, but it’s mostly focused on displaying many options to people on both sides of the marketplace. It’s a very large singles bar with some pre-sorting and ranking going on. Participants aren’t eager to give up their agency, and there’s not a lot of data about what happens after a match is made.
Linkedin amplified the ‘find a job’ x ‘find an employee’ dynamic, but it’s a similar approach. They don’t know who came in second at the end of a grueling job search, nor do they know a lot about which bosses make good bosses or accomplish useful hires.
These marketplaces feel so vast and so human that it’s difficult to suggest that AI is going to make much of an impact. But I’m confident that it will. There’s so much expense and wasted time and anxiety around these essential connections that some part of the market will be open to engaging… and success will lead to more success.
We have a lot of fake agency, where we think we’re making a choice in hiring or connecting with others, but that choice is influenced by structures and dynamics that aren’t actually related to what we want. If it’s sunny on the day of the open house, more people make an offer…
We’re using false proxies and amplifying negative cultural tropes to shortcut our selection processes, and it harms everyone involved.
We don’t need a better digital resume, or a way to get the word out. We need to get much smarter about what we want, why we want it and what’s likely to work.
Creating connections between and among buyers and sellers in dramatically more productive ways is (possibly) around the corner.","May 25, 2024","Two-sided markets, AI transformation, marketplace efficiency"
The challenge of N + 1,"“Just a little more,” might be a useful way to self motivate, until it isn’t.
N + 1 pushes us to win every race, every argument, every bank balance competition. Sometimes this is simply a self challenge, not designed to hurt others, but the problem with never being satisfied is that the loser is also going to be you.

2 + 2,"Arguments about taste are more common than ever before. The long tail makes it easy to find what you like, and to talk about what you don’t. There’s no accounting for taste, and that’s a good thing.
Because taste is useful.
Flopping the toilet paper under or over the roll, Beatles vs. Stones, Chevy vs. Ford… the interactions and tribal identity that result from these discussions satisfies our need to be seen, to have agency and to be part of something.
Sports fans don’t change the outcome of the game, but they have fun arguing about it.
If you want to listen to Jamaican polka music, please do. You can even make up new words or ignore the Oxford comma. If it helps, that’s okay.
We’ve built trillion-dollar media empires around this simple desire. Dividing and connecting and redividing over taste, preferences and niches.
But that habit can easily cross a line. It turns out that birds are real, that the Earth isn’t flat and that 2 + 2, in all common parlance, does equal 4. To argue about these things isn’t useful.
Quantum mechanics doesn’t care if Albert Einstein believes in it or not. It’s still the best explanation available for what happens when things are very small.
Public health, math, engineering and the science that underlies them isn’t based on taste or the need we have to be in groups. Show your work, make a prediction, assert something falsifiable and then give others a chance to respond. If you can make helpful predictions and create interventions that produce value, your work is useful. Otherwise, it’s simply noise.
Every day, we’re celebrating a splintering of taste, but it’s worth pausing before we embrace the idea that there are no facts. That’s not useful.","May 23, 2024","Taste, Arguments, Truth"

In my experience, there are two uncomfortable pedagogical methods that lead to better learning outcomes:

Noodling for professionals,"When Miles Davis recorded Kind of Blue with his sextet, they spent a total of four days in the recording studio. They created one of the bestselling and most important jazz albums of all time in less than a week.
Of course, they’d been exploring for months. In clubs, in front of an audience, trading fours and taking risks.
Studio time is expensive. Studio time should be de-risked.

I was wrong about sun tea,"The story is a good one: put some tea bags in a mason jar filled with fresh, cold water. Put it in the sun. Four hours later, smooth and delicious tea is waiting for you. The photons from the sun go through the clear glass and the water, strike the leaves and transfer radiant energy to the tea.
This isn’t actually what happens.
It turns out that the sun simply warms the water a bit, and tea happens. You can make cold water tea in the fridge more safely, because it keeps the water cold (though it takes much longer).
Of course, the lesson has nothing to do with tea. Or even beverages.
It’s that I was enamored with the story and stopped being curious. It would have been easy to set up the experiment. Worse, I never bothered to look it up. It was better, apparently, to feel right than to know what was actually happening.

The same is true for analogies and relationships of words.
If someone says, “A baseball manager is like the conductor of an orchestra,” they don’t mean that the manager wears a tuxedo and waves a stick. Understanding context and being willing to look for what the purpose of the analogy is takes a bit of effort.

Complaints are a gift,"It’s easy to see a complaint as simple whining, the narcissistic impatience of someone who has enough insulation from the real world that they can share their dissatisfaction over just about anything.
But a complaint unheard gives us no way to improve.
In our current medical system, doctors can seek to minimize complaints, to explain them away with a negative test or a shrug of the shoulders. But the purpose of medicine isn’t to pass a test, it’s to improve the well-being of the patient.
We’re under no obligation to embrace or even listen to a complaint. We can always help the complainant by sending them to another vendor or professional who is eager to try to help.
But if we choose to engage, then the complaint is a gift. It’s a clue about what might be at the root of the problem.
And solving problems is our job.","May 16, 2024","complaints, improvement, medicine"
The obligations of the Town Hall,"A few hundred years ago, small towns in New England embraced the idea of the town hall. Citizens (at the time, just the white men) came together and worked through the town’s agenda. Each person could speak, each person could vote, it was direct and sometimes effective.
Part of the innovation was the idea that each vote was equal, regardless of how much land you owned or wealth or status you had acquired. (Conveniently ignoring all the souls left out of the meeting.)
When there’s no representative to blame, the responsibility feels different. When everyone in the room can speak, there’s also an expectation that people will listen as they wait their turn. The entire endeavor only works if people are willing to engage and seek mutual success.
We agree to speak with care, to listen to others, to change our minds when useful and to abide by the will of the majority. That’s a lot.
It’s not unusual for companies to have an event, as often as weekly, that they call a town hall. But this is different. It’s largely a performance, not a conversation among peers. Everyone very muchdoesn’tget a vote. This is a feature of the corporation, not a bug. We label the roles with power, and clearly put them on a chart.
Traditional Town Halls require each participant to understand their responsibility as well as the power of their vote. They use cultural cohesion and the permanence of real estate in a small town to create civility and mutual respect. It’s not surprising that they don’t scale very well.
When a company actually wants the opinions of those who work there, there are far more effective ways to have a productive conversation around the insights and desires that we each bring to the organization. Asynchronous and structured, these interactions are vital sources of connection and wisdom.
I’m all in favor of a well-run company meeting. When bosses have the guts and energy to describe their vision for the future, it can make a difference. But it’s not a town hall.",,"Town Hall, Civic Engagement, Corporate Communication"

After Niels Bohr began describing quantum mechanics, the atomic bomb became inevitable. The laws of physics combined with the game theory of competitive sovereign nations meant that sooner or later, it would be discovered.

The defensive arrogance of TL;DR,"Ever since there has been high school, there has been the instinct to read the Cliffs Notes. The internet took this idea, added a gratuitous semicolon and perfected Too Long; Didn’t Read. This is the mistakenly proud assertion that we are far too busy and too important to read the whole thing, we skimmed a summary instead.
At first glance, it seems as though AI is good at this.
Why read four pages when you can read a few bullet points instead?
Or why bother sitting through Waiting for Godot, when the summary gives away the plot: “Two men, Vladimir and Estragon, wait for the enigmatic Godot. They engage in meandering conversations and encounter other characters, but Godot never arrives, underscoring the absurdity and futility of existence.”
TL;DR is defensive. Not simply because it defends our time, but because it defends us from change and from lived experience. A joke isn’t funny because it has a punchline. It’s funny because something happens to us as the joke unfolds, and the punch line is simply a punctuation of that experience.
“Orange you glad I didn’t say banana,” isn’t funny by itself.
Ask someone who finished running a marathon–for many, the moment they crossed the finish line is not the most memorable part of the experience, and for those that find that it is, it only matters because of the tens of thousands of steps that came before.
When we lean into exploration, we’re far more likely to find something that matters. Because we worked for it.
[Ted Gioiahas coined a great term: Dopamine Culture. Here’s the chart that goes with it]:
It’s easy to miss the point.
The graph and the data underlying it seem to indicate that if you’re a creator or consumer of any of the above, the righthand column is the place to be.
Cavitation happens here. We’re at a rolling boil, and there’s a lot of pressure to turn our work and the work we consume to steam.
The steam analogy is worthwhile: a thirsty person can’t subsist on steam. And while there’s a lot of it, you’re unlikely to collect enough as a creator to produce much value.
Back in the old days of ‘slow traditional culture’ there were plenty of conversations, music in the parlor and even daydreams about dating. But we didn’t count those. The real stuff was the solid stuff, the informal didn’t truly matter.
And now we live in a time where the previously informal is easy to measure.

We don’t just take these once magic items for granted, now we express frustration that they’re not better or cheaper or faster. The fade is real and the half-life continues to get shorter.
It’s a sort of hedonic treadmill of tech, where we not only take a breakthrough for granted in just a short time, but we also raise the bar for what counts as magic next time.
If we depend on outside forces to find wonder and awe, we’re going to end up disappointed.

Convenience in the short run often comes at the expense of comfort. The comfort of resilience, of kindness, of long-term satisfaction. The comfort of offering someone dignity, a hand up or knowing that we put our effort into something useful.

Movies and then Technicolor made the world seem more vivid when it was normal.
But then we took a big step backward. YouTube, compressed MP3 files and grunge typography made the world a bit compressed and janky.

Return on effort,"It’s a pretty simple calculation.
How much value per dollar does a freelancer produce for you? What’s the psychic reward for the time you put into your favorite hobby? That machine that takes time and money to set up and run… what does it create when it’s operating?
Not everything can or should be evaluated on a return on effort basis, but when we’re comparing two alternatives, it’s a fine place to start.
Instead, we often find ourselves focusing on how easy it is to avoid the issue and choose to focus our effort on more of what we did yesterday, or how painful it might be to walk away from a sunk cost or asset. We think about the effortaroundthe effort, instead of the choices we can make each day about what might be worth our focus.","June 25, 2024","Return on effort, value assessment, decision making"

The Coney Island problem,"Disney theme parks created more than 20 billion dollars in revenue last year.
Coney Island, not so much.
Coney Island is dozens of small honky tonk vendors and attractions, an ecosystem, not a corporation.
Independent local stores got hammered by the more organized stores in the mall and then by the centrally controlled Wal-mart and other box stores. And then the big box stores got hammered in turn by Amazon, a rigidly controlled system that puts the little guys at its mercy.
RSS and blogs were a federation of independent voices. It didn’t take much for them to be co-opted by a few tech giants.
We’d like to believe that we prefer to walk down the picturesque street, visiting one merchant after another, buying directly from the creator or her gallery. We’d like to think that the centralized antiseptic option isn’t for us…
And yet, when thesupermarcheopens in rural France, it does very well.
It turns out that we respond well to large entities that pretend that they’re simply a conglomeration of independent voices and visions, but when masses of people are given a choice, they’re drawn to the big guy, not the real thing.
The long tail is real, but we’ve been trained to prefer it if the tail is contained within a centrally-controlled system run by a corporation.","June 22, 2024","Coney Island, independent merchants, centralized systems"

The near future (and summer reads),"Near-future science fiction is a fine way to consider our now. Without the reality of today, we can think hard about the tomorrow we’re about to live in.
Summer reads are supposed to be a bit lighter.
Technological change is making our near future a bit harder to dance with, and yet, here are some books I strongly recommend–not because they gloss over our possible futures, but because they give us the scaffolding to look hard at it while we can still make an impact.
Foundryis a thriller about semiconductors. Fast-moving and classic Peper.
When H.A.R.L.I.E. Was Oneis the very first novel I read about AI. I was 12 years old. Gerrold wrote this a lifetime ago, and yet it will make you think.
The Ministry for the Futureis heartbreaking and life-changing. Every human should be offered a copy and encouraged to read it.
The Very Nice Boxhelps us think about workplace roles (with some marketing and design as a bonus).
The Last Policemanis fabulous metaphor and a great way to get clear about how you’d like to spend tomorrow.
All highly recommended.","June 20, 2024","Near-future, summer reads, science fiction"
Phrenology,"For thousands of years, and as recently as the 1930s, phrenology was seen as a useful proxy to judge someone’s character.
Carefully charting the bumps on someone’s head, along with the slope of their forehead and other telltale signs was seen as a thoughtful and proven way to determine whether someone was creative, honest or empathic.
Even with the nutty pseudoscience we are all surrounded by, it’s pretty easy to tell that this is nonsense.
And yet, we want proxies so badly, we embraced this idea for centuries, despite a lack of evidence.
We engage in this soothsaying search for proxies every time we do a job interview with someone. Unless we’re interviewing for people who have interviewing as their job, there isn’t a lot of evidence that doing a great job in the interview means you’re going to do a great job.
False proxies are expensive. They also create significant social and moral hazards.
Perhaps hanging up this poster is a good way to remind us not to fall into that trap.",,"Phrenology, Proxies, Pseudoscience"
Are you weather?,"The thunderstorm doesn’t know we exist. Rain dances and wishes are ineffective at bringing or preventing a storm, because it isn’t caused by our actions.
Metaphorical weather is tempting to mistake as a response. When someone cuts us off in traffic or doesn’t engage with us the way we might hope for, it’s easy to take it personally.
But the weather would be there with or without you.
There are two useful questions:
The first is whether we’re signing up to be in weather conditions that aren’t safe or helpful.
And second, when the tables are turned, is to ask ourselves, “Am I being someone else’s weather right now?” Because that’s something we do have control over.","June 19, 2024","weather, metaphor, control"

The intentional stance,"Dan Dennett explained that it began as a survival mechanism. It’s important to predict how someone else is going to behave. That tiger might be a threat, that person from the next village might have something to offer.
If we simply wait and see, we might encounter an unwelcome or even fatal surprise. The shortcut that the intentional stance offers us is, “if I were them, I might have this in mind.” Assuming intent doesn’t always work, but it works often enough that all humans embrace it.
There’s the physical stance (a rock headed toward a window is probably going to break it) and the design stance (this ATM is supposed to dispense money, let’s look for the slot.) But the most useful and now problematic shortcut is imagining that others are imagining.
There used to be a chicken in an arcade in New York that played tic tac toe. The best way to engage with the chicken game was to imagine that the chicken had goals and strategies and that he was ‘hoping’ you would go there, not there.
Of course, chickens don’t do any hoping, any more than chess computers are trying to get you to fall into a trap when they set up an en passant. But we take the stance because it’s useful. It’s not an accurate portrayal of the state of the physical entity, but it might be a useful way to make predictions.
There’s a certain sort of empathy here, extending ourselves to another entity and imagining that it has intent. But there’s also a lack of empathy, because we assume that the entity is just like us… but also a chicken.
The challenge kicks in when our predictions of agency and intent don’t match up with what happens next.
AI certainly seems like it has earned both a design and an intentional stance from us. Even AI researchers treat their interactions with a working LLM as if they’re talking to a real person, perhaps a little unevenly balanced, but a person nonetheless.
The intentional stance brings rights and responsibilities, though. We don’t treat infants as though they want something the way we might, which makes it easier to live with their crying. Successful dog trainers don’t imagine that dogs are humans with four legs–they boil down behavior to inputs and outputs, and use operant conditioning, not reasoning, to change behavior.
Every day, millions of people are joining the early adopters who are giving AI systems the benefit of the doubt, a stance of intent and agency. But it’s an illusion, and the AI isn’t ready for rights and can’t take responsibility.
The collision between what we believe and what will happen is going to be significant, and we’re not even sure how to talk about it.
The intentional stance is often useful, but it’s not always accurate. When it stops being useful, we need to use a different model for how to understand and what to expect.","June 17, 2024","intentional stance, AI, empathy"
Spam 3.0,"Any fully open system of digital communication will corrode over time. Bad messages will crowd out the good ones.
The new normal: Someone finds a database of every residential property, then another of cell phones. An AI is trained to call every homeowner, every day, asking if they’re thinking of selling their home. Millions of calls an hour. The leads (one out of 40,000 calls, perhaps) are sold to real estate brokers.
Multiply this by 500 different hustlers in a dozen industries, and now the open nature of the phone is gone forever.
And then texts.
And of course, email. An inbox with 100,000 unread messages in it is no longer a functional tool.
Open systems come with the requirement of self-restraint and humanity. When we replace those with automated stealers of attention with a profit margin, the system can no longer remain open.

Better than Google,"I haven’t done a Google search in months.
Perplexityis more powerful, more pleasant and more effective.
Instead of being corrupted by invasive ads, surveillance and sneaky dark patterns, it presents you with a simple, footnoted explanation of exactly what you’re looking for. Asked and answered.
And I like that there’s a pro version that we can pay for. This makes us the customer, not the product.
Most of all, the limited scope of the promise gives AI a chance to shine. ChatGPT often comes across as both arrogant and bumbling, because it promises that it can do everything, all at once. Perplexity is simply a smart search partner without the corrosion that racing for more ad dollars will cause. At least for now.
So far, I’d give it five stars. It’s worth checking out.","June 15, 2024","Perplexity, search engine, AI"
Boundaries and limits,"They serve different purposes.
The fence near the train tracks is a boundary. You can go near it without risk. The electrified third rail, on the other hand, is a limit. If you touch it, you’re done.
Boundaries can give us room to innovate and thrive. Budgets, schedules and specifications all exist to show us where the safe areas are. Sure, go to the edges and challenge the boundaries, that’s why they’re there.
But limits aren’t boundaries. Limits are the end, the danger zone, the thing to avoid.
Some people bristle at boundaries. They’d like to have a project with no budget and no deadline. The problem with living without boundaries is that the limits sneak up on you, and then, boom, it’s over.

The seduction of false promises,"Why do we buy the pitch of the snake oil salesman, the flim-flam man, the con artist, the demagogue or the trickster?
As our modern world becomes more informed and more rational, we see an increase (not the expected decrease) in scams, hustles, and chaos. There are Jokers and Riddlers on every corner, and our email box and mailbox are filled with schemes and manipulations. None of them would succeed if we didn’t support them.
What’s the attraction of these shortcuts?
Human culture is fueled and remade by insurgents. Successful art, innovation, and technology make promises that at first, are hard to distinguish from selfish cons like perpetual motion and pyramid schemes. The emperor has no clothes, but wouldn’t it be nice to believe that he did?
Contradicting forces of complacency, greed, and despair are some of the conditions that can lead us to getting tricked.
Complacencyis a cousin of boredom. When things feel safe, our ennui might give us an itch for adventure.
Greedis the engine of capitalism and a component of status, and it tends to scale–people with more want even more, and they want it right away and without a lot of effort.
Anddespairis a lack of hope, a feeling that the existing paths can’t possibly offer what we need.
The good news is that we don’t fall for every scam, and we’ve gotten better at being resilient in the face of broken promises. It’s culture that pushes us to find a shortcut, but it’s also culture that can save us from the next one.
Being surrounded by a community that sees and tells the truth, that establishes a standard for keeping promises and that applauds long-term generative thinking is a resilient way forward.Connectionhelps us find traction, and forward motion toward better.
We get to choose whichcommunity narrativewe want to absorb. And we get to choose whether we want to share those ideas with those we lead and connect with. We pick a neighborhood to live in, and we can pick a culture to be part of.
No whining, no shortcuts, no hustles. The long-run matters. Honor the rules that protect people who aren’t in your shoes, because you might be them one day.

After the emergency,"If we need to wait until after the short-term emergency is settled, it’s unlikely we’re ever going to get to work on the long-term important work.

The half apology,"What a waste.
Something went wrong, and the other person cared enough about the relationship to let you know.
Perhaps they’re hoping that you can rebuild a bridge. That you can see what they see and care enough to do something about it.
A half apology is a little like half a balloon. It takes effort, but it doesn’t have much utility.
Honoring the moment, an apology is a chance to reconnect and actually move forward. If that’s not your goal, a half-apology might be fine, but don’t expect much to come of it. If you can’t see or accept the other person’s situation, you haven’t responded to the very thing that prompted the apology in the first place.
The opportunity for an apology is just that–an opportunity to demonstrate to the person you care about that you see them, understand them, and are concerned enough to extend yourself.
The useful apology celebrates the relationship and takes responsibility for what went wrong. It’s hard to minimize your way through this moment. Empathy and care might be a more useful alternative than trying to get it over with without too much responsibility taken.","June 9, 2024","apology, empathy, relationship"

Hardness can be perfect. You can measure it. Softness, on the other hand, is multi-dimensional.

Practical empathy (vs. telepathy),"“If I were you…”
or, more commonly, “if you were me.”
Management has never been easy, but as the world becomes more complex, it gets more difficult.
We’d like to imagine that the person (or AI bot, or freelancer, or firm) that we hired has enough drive, insight and common sense to do exactly what we do in the situation.
No need to spell everything out, just think like me and do the right thing.
Of course, the person being managed is just as challenged in empathy as you are. You don’t know what it’s like to be them, and vice versa.
The person we’re counting on doesn’t see what we see, doesn’t know what we know and might not even want what we want.
We can deny this and insist that they read our heart and our minds.
Or we can embrace this and lean into empathy. We can draw a very clear picture of what we seek and create the conditions for the person to do the work that we’d like to have done.
Managing is a skill and it’s difficult. Sometimes, we’re lucky enough to work with someone who manages themselves, but we don’t often give this commitment the credit it deserves.

What does the world owe us?,"This question is a trap. It’s based on scarcity and entitlement, and most of all, the world isn’t listening. When more and more people focus on this question, it simply pushes us apart.
On the other hand, “what do I owe the world?” opens the door for endless opportunity. When lots of people ask this question, the contributions add up, the connections are solidified and better is possible.

Did you see it in the theater?,"We’re in the middle of a huge and unusual shift.
The magazine publisher acted like the best sales were newsstand sales, even though the profit came from subscriptions and most people simply visited the website.
Book publishers and editors seem to focus on selling copies on paper, sold in independent bookstores. They spend as little time as they can on audiobooks.
The actors, producers and directors count the sales of tickets and popcorn. Watching the superclip on YouTube doesn’t count, and Netflix is okay, but mostly because it gives them another chance at the theater.
Record labels still focus on radio airplay and vinyl or CD sales. Streaming just isn’t the same when it comes to hits.
And theNew York Timesnow generates more time on-site and profit from word games than they do from news. You wouldn’t know that from their staffing or the conversations they have.
Bestseller lists capture our attention, but which lists? To what end?
The Long Tail plus always-on streaming can’t help but transform the culture. Muhammad Ali was the last “most famous person in the world” and that record probably won’t be broken.

If you have raised a ton of venture investment…
If you are embracing the discontent of being unpublished, undistributed or unfunded…
An alternative is to seek to strip away all market insulation, the equivalent of the kid selling cookies at a table in front of their house. Either people buy the cookies or they don’t.
The market might be wrong, it might be callous or it might be stupid, but there it is, right in front of you.
Too much market awareness pushes us to be short-sighted, hustling to pander.

Of course, it’s not just mythical creatures beloved by children. It’s our adherence to a social norm, loyalty to a leader or the structure of a point of view.
We’re pretty good at allowing our incorrect certainties to slowly fade into the background, without a crisis or reckoning. We gradually move on, now even more certain about the other things we’re certain of.

As soon as we declare it important and invite the world to compete, the problems become more difficult.

A bowl of rice,"It’s expensive. Hundreds of people were involved in getting you that simple bowl of rice. It involved countless gallons of water, hours of labor, gallons of fuel. A complex supply chain that ensured you got what you needed, in perfect condition, just as you were ready for it.
And it’s cheap. The amount of time the typical person needs to work to earn enough to buy a bowl of rice is lower than it has ever been in history.
It’s tempting to make the rice just a bit cheaper, just a tad more convenient. To pay even less attention so we can get back to whatever it is we were doing.
But it’s useful to realize that we can make the rice far better, and just a little less convenient.
I can make a bowl of rice using brown Nagano Milky-Queen rice from Japan. I can prepare it in a Cuckoo pressurized rice cooker. And I can serve it in a handmade ceramic bowl. All in, perhaps this bowl of rice costs me an extra twenty cents and takes a few minutes longer.

The two bicycle errors,"Momentum activities like public speaking, board sports and leadership all share an attribute with riding a bicycle: It gets easier when you get good at it.
The first error we often make is believing that someone (even us) will never be good at riding a bike, because riding a bike is so difficult. When we’re not good at it, it’s obvious to everyone.
The second error is coming to the conclusion that people who are good at it are talented, born with the ability to do it. They’re not, they have simply earned a skill that translates into momentum.
There’s a difference between, “This person is a terrible public speaker,” and “this person will never be good at public speaking.”
And there’s a difference between, “They are a great leader,” and “they were born to lead.”
The thing about momentum activities is that we notice them only twice: when people are terrible at them, and when they’re good at it. That includes the person you see in the mirror.","July 24, 2024","momentum, skill development, perception"
Doing it step by step,"I was surprised to discover that for many AI questions, if you add, “please figure this out step by step,” the AI willprovidea dramatically more accurate and useful answer. This works on simple questions like, “how many times does the letter ‘r’ appear in the word ‘strawberry'” to much more complex issues.
It probably won’t surprise you to consider that this works even better for people.
When we ask a simple question, we often get an opinion or a memorized answer in return. “Freon gas” is not how a refrigerator works, it’s simply a two-word meme to get us through the question so we can move on. When we prompt a human brain to explain the steps, an entirely different process kicks in.
Thoughtful inquiry, pedagogy and user experience design push us to activate this sort of thinking. Yes, a problem often needs a knee-jerk response. It’s not efficient to perform rote tasks with step-by-step analysis.

What is almost always done in practice is actually better referred to as re-logo-ing.
A brand is not a logo. A brand is a promise, a story and a shorthand. A brand tells us what to expect the next time we engage with you.
Being named Fred is not a brand. Fred is your name, not your promise. If you’re an unreliable, selfish hustler,that’syour brand.
Begin with this:Your name doesn’t have to say what you do. Starbucks, Nike, Western Union, Maya Angelou, The Grateful Dead… these are fine names, but they are not descriptive. They earned a secondary meaning–the brand stands for something, because the work stands for something, and so the name is associated with that.
If your brand isn’t doing everything you hope, it might be because your organization isn’t doing the work that the brand could or should or might promise it does.
Clarity matters:Being specific and consistent and clear in what you do and what you stand for is challenging work, but worth it. It requires less compromise and a willingness to walk away from all the soft edges that the committee might be insisting on.
We know what the Bat Signal means. We know who’s going to show up, what he’s going to be wearing and what will happen next.
Understanding vs. action:Is it possible to be more clear in your name and public statements so that it’s really obvious what you do, so that more people would understand? Of course. We could change Louis Vuitton to “Really expensive bags for socially insecure people,” but I’m not sure it would increase sales.
Given that your project isn’t for everyone, the goal isn’t for everyone to understand it. The goal is for people who might take action to understand it enough that they will take action. Every great brand that I know of has as the unspoken next line in their brief: “This might not be for you.”
What will I tell my friends?It’s not easy for me to talk about the work of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi simply because I didn’t grow up knowing how to say his name. But it’s not simply the spoken logo that matters. When I tell the others about what you do, do I feel smart or stupid? Can you establish the conditions where sharing your core ideas and mission is tempting, generous and affirming for the people you need to have talk about it? If your name or logo get in the way of that, please change it.
Who is this for?What do they believe, what do they wish for and treasure? Ignore the others.
Where is the tension?What will happen if I don’t do something right now? What if I keep quiet? What is imminent, what will I miss? The default is the status quo, the standard response is, “maybe later.” If you don’t create tension, there will be no change.
Are you building a culture?“People like us do things like this.”
No one ever bought anything on an elevator.Your pitch isn’t designed to fully explain what you do or even to make the sale. Your ride on the elevator only exists to make it more likely that someone will follow you out of the elevator asking you questions about what you do.
Knock-knock jokes teach us a lot about all of this. If we say “knock knock” to someone we have permission to share a joke with, they will say “who’s there?” Interactions ensue. On the other hand, if you’re running around insisting on telling jokes to strangers, you’re being annoying. And the best lesson is: If you’ve ever heard one of these jokes, you definitely didn’t hear it from the person who made it up. Ideas that spread, win.
I don’t care about your logo, really. Few of us do. If you don’t believe me, look hard at the logos for Starbucks, Neutrogena and Hermes. It really doesn’t matter. It’s fun to be a pirate (they have a great logo) but it’s better to do work that we care about, work that people honor and share.
Branding agencies serve a useful purpose–they cause the client to pause and answer hard questions. Making it look good doesn’t really matter.","July 17, 2024","branding, rebranding, brand identity"
Bullies,"Bullies use intimidation and power to force others to act against their best interests.
Bullies blame the victim, assuring everyone that they wouldn’t have to use force if people would simply go along with what they want. Effective bullies organize a small mob to enforce their wishes.
Living and working with bullies is no fun. And it’s not productive or resilient.
The blame that bullies spread is divisive. As a result, the bully separates the community instead of connecting it, using the power of the mob to harm the outliers.
And a bullied community often cowers in fear instead of leaning into possibility.
Most of all, bullies are weak. They can’t tolerate change and refuse to listen or improve.
Resilient, generative and productive approaches to problems are always a better path forward.","July 16, 2024","Bullies, Intimidation, Community"
The page-a-day calendar,"Time passes. And humans have always kept track.
Distribution and technology combined to create a few decades where the tear off daily calendar was nearly ubiquitous (read on for details on my new one, a collaboration with Debbie Millman).
First, the industry needed to efficiently produce a block of 365 pages, each being easy to tear off.
And then it needed a culture that would be attracted to a long tail of cartoons, brands, hobbies and personalities.
Finally, publishers would need a nationwide chain of stores to merchandise and promote the perfect gift item for a few weeks of the year, just before New Year’s.
A day-to-day calendar is a lovely gift, even if you’re not stuffing a stocking. It is just frivolous enough, thoughtful enough and specific enough to give the recipient a smile, without incurring too much of an obligation.
The timing for calendars was a miracle. Each year, the new year starts just a week after the biggest gift-giving holiday.
As you can imagine, they sold alotof calendars.
Now, distribution has changed, and so has tech. People don’t need a calendar to know what day it is, and their desk is a very different place than it was before everything was on a device. The lead time for calendars is still long, but the ability of a nationwide chain to display them isn’t what it used to be.
Not the best time for me to start creating calendars, but that’s okay. Last year’s calendar ended up being the fourth bestselling one the company published, and we’re back this year.
Almost all of the calendars made now sell online, and most of the orders happen months before the holidays. They don’t sell nearly the way they used to, but I still like the way they ground us in the moment.
This year, I created the calendar with my friendDebbie Millman. She’s the original podcaster, a dean at SVA, and a gifted and generous artist.
Here’s the link to check out the calendar.
Debbie has been reading this blog for decades, and she picked some of her favorite riffs, then hand-lettered each on an iPad. It’s already a #1 bestseller in at least one category.
The publisher prints their entire supply all at once and won’t make any more. I hope you enjoy it. Thanks, Debbie!","July 15, 2024","calendar, collaboration, distribution"
The distribution of character,"Along the way, we have been taught to associate character skills like honesty, rationality, agreeableness, grit and care with surface metrics like wealth or power.
That’s almost certainly incorrect. And if we make assumptions based on vague measures of class, we’re going to get tricked.
In any village, cabal or cadre, you’ll probably see a similar percentage of bad actors. If anything, the fancy people might overindex for selfishness.

Giving up vs. quitting,"Shrug your shoulders, care less, phone it in.
One software company I used to depend on has sort of given up. They have plenty of cash in the bank, but they simply stopped trying. You can feel it in their updates, their customer service, their approach to the future.
Giving up is a waste.
Quitting, on the other hand, is a fine thing to do. Because quitting gives you tomorrow back. It opens the door for the next contribution you are able to make.
In or out.
The top of the fence is no place to hang out.","July 13, 2024","Giving up, quitting, contribution"
Student coach,"Big football at colleges in the US costs more than $5 billion a year. And none of these programs has a student acting as a coach.
The same analysis, at a much smaller scale, applies to school theater directors and producers, conductors of the jazz band or orchestra and even the coach of the chess team.
We learn by doing, not by winning.
What happens if we embrace this and make education about learning? What would happen if the head of the football program simply taught students how to be coaches? Or the head of the music program challenged kids to conduct?
My most important learning experiences in organized schooling came from the random moments when I actually got to organize instead of being organized.","July 12, 2024","student coaching, education, experiential learning"
"How, why and hyperbole","There are three trends in copywriting that have been so overused they should now be avoided. The first two:
Headlines with “why” for articles that don’t actually explain why.
Headlines with “how” that don’t really teach you how.
Explaining why is difficult, which is where the value lies. People would like to understand things that confuse them, so they search for ‘why’ or click on it when an apparently reputable source promises the answer. Even major newspapers are discovering that this is a fine way to get attention. Alas, it’s not a promise that’s easily kept.
And ‘how’, which should be a simpler promise to honor, falls into a similar trap.
With the rise of AI and LLMs, these headlines have gone from fake promises to redundant. We can simply ask an AI for the How and the Why and we’re likely to get better insight than a content farm can offer us… so the few trusted brands that are left ought to make these promises more carefully.
The third trend is becoming more pernicious. I got an email yesterday from a founder I respect, and there was an astounding promise or claim in every third line. The YouTube videos that the email pointed to all had headlines that could have come out of a supermarket tabloid or a late night informercial ad. There was no way the reality could match the hype, and it’s a shame, because the reality was actually useful.
The pressure is real. The argument is that if you don’t follow the trend and out-hype everyone else (“you’ll never believe this secret!”) then you won’t get traffic and you’ll fail.
But the evidence clearly points in the other direction. Trust is what’s in short supply, not attention.
You can always create a short-term commotion to get a bit of attention. But you can’t possibly hype your way into being trusted.","July 11, 2024","copywriting, trust, hyperbole"
Projects and the long haul,"Rome was built in a day.
It wasn’t finished in a day. In fact, it’s still not finished.
But the day someone said, “this is Rome,” and announced the project, it was there.
Sometimes we get hung up on the beginning, unwilling to start Rome unless we’re sure we can finish it without incident.
Sometimes we get hung up on the finishing, starting things all the time but blinking in the face of Resistance and wandering away.
The long haul is simply your list of completedprojects. A career is not a series of tasks. It’s the chance to build things.","July 10, 2024","projects, perseverance, career"
Sudare sette camicie,"Sweating through seven shirts…
That was the definition of work when work was the same thing as physical labor.
For many of us, the physical labor is no longer the way we add value.
And it’s tempting to imagine that we simply have to show up for the coffee.
But it’s still called work.

Kazoo lessons,"Knowledge and technique used to be closely guarded secrets. Admission to the guild was reserved for a few, and crafts like typesetting, plumbing and medicine were off limits to most folks.
One of the reasons for the explosion in productivity and innovation in the last century is that more tools and leverage are available to more people than ever before.
But, along the way, we began to prize tools that were convenient, easy to engage with and flat. Flat in that more experience didn’t always lead to better results. Five minutes with a kazoo sounds a lot like five hours with one.

It’s easy to memorize a few words that purport to explain something, but all they do is relabel it.
If you truly understand something, you can use different modalities to help someone else understand it.

The paradox of lessons,"The people most likely to sign up for coaching or additional learning are the folks who are already good at their craft.
“I’m terrible at this,” can lead to, “and I don’t want to be reminded of it.” Or perhaps, “I don’t want to waste their time,” or, “I’m never going to get better.”
When it’s possible to get better, embracing mediocrity isn’t a useful strategy.
I’d rather have a surgeon who regularly attends trainings, wouldn’t you?

Cat and mouse games,"I hope that most of us would agree that driving 50 mph in a school zone where little kids cross the street is a significant safety problem. The speed limit is there for good reason, and if you selfishly and recklessly blow through the crosswalk, you ought to get a summons.
Municipalities can now hire a service that uses an automated speed camera to find the scofflaws and issue summonses directly, without the random luck of getting away with it as a factor.
But of course, cars now have computers in them, and GPS as well, so a car could easily be built so that it cut out the middleman and simply warned the driver and then issued itself a summons.
We’re inconsistent about how we interpret freedom and responsibility. The status quo gets the benefit of the doubt, simply because it’s what we’re used to.
Freedom’s fabulous, but as soon as we interact with others, it comes with responsibility.
As our communities become ever more interwoven and the surveillance of our actions becomes more complete, the cats and mice aren’t going to be nearly as relevant as to what sort of balance we all seek to strike between freedom and responsibility.
It should not be controversial for us to be responsible for the impact of what we say and what we do. Cats and mice have nothing to do with it.","July 4, 2024","safety, responsibility, freedom"
Software done well,"There are a few tools I use regularly that make me smile, because the craftspeople who made them decided to build something with extra magic and care.

Avoiding the trap questions,"A trick question is designed to fool us into proposing the wrong answer (example below).
Atrapquestion, on the other hand, stops the train completely.
A trap question demands an answer, and the answer will paralyze us and keep us from the work at hand.
“Yes, but how many followers does your brand have on Insta?” is a trap question. So is, “Are you sure you’re prepared enough for the talk you have booked next week?”
Trap questions bring out demands for perfectionism, or amplify feelings of shame. Trap questions ought to be ignored, avoided, or, if we must respond, simply say, “it’s not a priority.”
Time spent on trap questions is time you’ll never get back.

The sad compromise of “sponsored results”,"Google made a fortune and honed sponsored search results into an art form. The theory is that people who want the traffic the most will pay for the clicks, and of course, if the advertisers don’t have something you ultimately want, they’ll just waste their money. Let the market work it out–the dollars become a self-fueling sort of search algorithm.
Google was a miracle, and it also offered smart organic results and clearly labeled ads, so most of us accepted this.
Now, though, hotel listings don’t even bother to pretend they’re sorted in any order but “what makes us the most money.” Yelp requires us to wade through fast food franchises and other lazy advertisers to get where we’re going. And recently, Amazon has jumped the shark by selling out their customers to the highest bidder.
Add smartphones to the mix, with their tiny screens and low impulse control, and the ads stop looking like ads.
Not only are the ads a worse experience for the user, they are also creating a tax on all the advertisers, and thus, on us. If the only way to get Amazon traffic is to buy the ads, then the only way to pay for the ads is to charge more…
We’ve been hooked on free media for a century. But newspapers and network TV evolved to be ever more clear about what’s content and what’s an ad. The internet, as in all things it does, hypercompetes for the last penny, costing all of us time, trust and money.

Knowing your customers,"In the very small business, the freelancer knows each customer. By name, by volume, by preferences.
And in the huge business, expensive software, data analysts and relentless margin seeking pushes organizations to increase their yield.
But most businesses (and non-profits and groups) are somewhere in between.
We don’t think of our customer list as a spreadsheet, but it is.
Perhaps you know names, addresses, emails and purchase history–but it’s likely that the customers you pay attention to are the noisy ones, or the ones that left in a huff. We’re distracted, though, because they’re not the majority, or the profitable ones, or the ones that really matter in the long run.
Tools likenumerous.aiwere inevitable, but seeing it work is still something of a miracle.

Here is our membership list along with recent attendees at our meetings. Who has dropped off in attendance and how should we contact them to see what’s up?
At a big company like Amazon, this is all usedagainstthe customers, creating dark patterns designed to extract more ad money while denigrating the user experience (but not enough to get people to leave).
At a small organization, though, it can be a breakthrough. It uses the smaller size of the organization to your advantage, because the insights can actually be put to use by a human. Used to make things better for the people who count on you.

But then I got scared because he’s rented our building on Great Jones and what if he is a flash in the pan and doesn’t have the money to pay his rent?”

In defense of the hard parts,"Yesterday’s post was a little glib. Without a doubt, we add more value when we focus on the emotional labor of important work, leaving others the chance to create commodities.
But the repetitive, difficult nature of leaning into commodity production can give us insight, humility and skill. It helps us understand just how hard the hard parts are, and creates an opportunity to bring innovation to the work to be done.

The hard parts (and the important parts),"The hard parts of what you do all day can feel fraught. It’s heavy lifting. Emergencies. Dangerous labor. The stakes are high and the work can be difficult.
The important parts of what you do all day are valuable to someone else. This is what you’re getting paid for–solving a customer’s problems.
A simple example:
The important part of running a successful condiments business is getting shelf space for your ketchup, promoting it so that people are eager to buy it, and keeping the promises you make the distributors and customers.
The hard part might involve actually making ketchup. Steam, heat, heavy objects, supply chains…
We can’t run this business without the hard parts, but that doesn’t mean we have to do it ourselves.
The thing is, there are other people you can buy the ketchup from. And you can also expand what you offer to include things that are easier to make but just as valuable to your customers. The important part feels risky. We might be afraid of it. It could require emotional labor. But it’s not the same as the hard part.
A trusted brand is important. Commodity products are hard.
When we persuade ourselves that the hard part is also the important part, there’s a small chance we have found the truth, but it’s likely we’re setting a trap that will keep us stuck.

This is absurd. It’s the very absurdity of it that makes it common. “I could do that,” is easier to say when we’re sure we can’t. Even if we had the talent, the resources and the time, the odds are so slim that it’s essentially a lottery. We’re off the hook, so it’s easy to pretend.
Whatcouldwe do if we spent the next four years on it? We could write and publish a symphony, start a reasonably successful small business, make a substantial contribution to our community, improve our physical health, engage more deeply with family and friends, learn to juggle or play the piano.

Long-term selfish,"Everyone is selfish. We do things that increase our chances of survival, help us achieve our goals and give us a story we can tell ourselves about our role in the community.
But short-term selfish is something we try to grow out of.
Short-term selfish runs a red light because we’re in a hurry. It dumps waste into the river because it’s cheaper than disposing of it properly. It cheats in order to win.
But none of these things help us reach our long-term goals. None of them are resilient or reliable, because when others also play the short-term game, we all lose.
Short-term selfish is against the minimum wage, while long-term leaders understand how much value it creates over time. And long-term selfish seeks an environment where we’re most likely to thrive.","August 14, 2024","selfishness, long-term goals, sustainability"
Multiple choice,"“None of the above” is often the best option.
We’re regularly confronted with multiple-choice questions. The foundation is already established, the options are already limited, do you want this or that?
But the real questions lie in the assumptions that happened before you were even asked.
When a developer brings you six website options, they’re skipping over critical questions about structure, upkeep, user experience and whether or not a site is the answer to your problem.
When the bank offers you three choices on how to borrow money, they’ve almost certainly found three that benefit the bank.
It’s impossible to have a productive day when every challenge and question leads to a full-on brainstorming session. But it might be worth rejecting the multiple-choice options when the outcomes really matter.","August 13, 2024","multiple-choice, options, assumptions"

Twenty questions,"Your next project might feel like a calling, but it’s a choice. A choice that will have an impact on each day you spend on it.
There are no right answers here, but before you fall in love with a business or an organization, it may pay to think about these and other options that are built in:
Pick your customers, pick your future.

Discovery and invention,"Isaac Newton didn’t invent gravity. It was there all along. He simply named and explained it.
The same is true for planets, continents and obscure species. They’re discovered, not invented.
Michelangelo talked about removing all the parts of the marble that weren’t the statue on his way to creating great art. Discovery is like that.
Often, we put ourselves on the hook to invent something, when it might be simpler and more direct to act like we’re exploring on our way to discovering something instead.","September 29, 2024","Discovery, Invention, Exploration"
Who do you want to become?,"Emotional enrollment is at the heart of performance, learning and connection.
A coach can quickly tell when someone is committed to changing their approach in order to change the outcome–it’s easy to tell this person apart from someone who simply wants what they’re already doing to be more effective.
“I want to become someone who’s shift is over,” is very different from, “I want to become someone who knows how to write copy that earns a sale.”
Bonnie Raitt partnered with producer Don Was to make her 10th album. If she had insisted that it simply be the tenth album, another shot at being discovered, it wouldn’t have become the album of the year. Instead, she and Was worked together to bring a new approach to the studio. After the album hit, she was still Bonnie Raitt, of course, but she was also a different sort of performer.
Being validated for who we are today is great. But it’s more likely that we can achieve our goals by choosing to become someone who can solve problems that the people we serve need solved.","September 28, 2024","Emotional enrollment, personal growth, problem-solving"
Snowballs and avalanches,"Residents leave a town because of a lack of services, which cuts the tax base, which leads to more services lost, which leads to more residents leaving…

Hiring for stuck,"Once an organization figures out a successful model, it begins to grow.
And when it grows, it needs more staff. And they often hire for specific tasks and the skills that go with them.
They need a person who will reliably and obediently deliver what they need right now.
And that’s the foundation for stuckness.
When the world changes, and it always does, the organization is filled with people who signed up for (and were hired for) a specific competency.
What would happen if instead, we hired problem solvers and resilient improv artists who were willing to do today’s job because it needed to be done, but were prepared (and eager) for tomorrow’s challenge as well?","September 25, 2024","hiring, problem solvers, organizational growth"
Knowing the territory,"There is always room for someone who really knows their way around an industry, a technology or a problem.

The rest of us, on the other hand, regularly use digital tools we don’t understand, don’t maintain and haven’t optimized.

The ledge,"Drowning is devastating, a tragic and painful way to go.
So much so thatfeelinglike we’re drowning is a trigger, an overwhelming emotion that causes us to grasp, struggle and leave our best self behind.
It’s easy to experience this even when we’re out of the water. When the stakes are high and time is short, we can activate drowning mode, losing our focus, resilience, and generosity.
The ledge can be a useful way to talk ourselves out of the spiral.
If you’re in 8 feet of water, it’s easy to feel afraid. But once you realize that you’re only a few inches away from a ledge, one you can return to whenever you like, it’s possible to reset, to find your bearings.
It’s not that hard to imagine a ledge. Sure, the parts didn’t arrive on time, but our deadline isn’t for a few days, back to the ledge, let’s regroup and come up with a new plan. Yes, the project didn’t work, but our budget has enough slack in it that we can try again with a new project tomorrow.
The ledge is a combination of time and money. It’s the buffer between here and disaster. The ledge is a foundation, a place we can find our footing as we think about the next steps. And the ledge offers perspective, because we can realize that even if this moment feels momentous, it might not be.
Resilient project management and risk-taking requires investing in a ledge. When we put everything on the line and cut the timing to the absolute minimum, the stakes get higher and we expose ourselves to failure.
Part of the art of innovation is choosing projects we can afford to dance with.
And the daily emotional work is reminding ourselves that the ledge is right there. So we can refocus and go back to being our best.","September 19, 2024","drowning, resilience, ledge"
A next frontier for spam and scams,"Please be on the alert for:
Spam that includes your name, address, phone number and other personal details.

A possible AI future,"Persistent, connected and kind.
Most visions of the internet in 1995 were about individuals interacting with content online. It turns out that the internet (inter plus net) is actually about connection. The apps and businesses that were most successful connected people–to ideas, to things or mostly, to each other.
The current range of AI feels like content creation. You can have an AI write your high school essay, draw you a picture or invent a recipe.
But perhaps history will repeat itself. Perhaps developers will realize that persistent knowledge of what came before and who needs help and connection is the next frontier.
(Alas, history may also repeat itself when venture backed companies build networks that are seductive and sticky, and then, once we depend on them, will intentionally make them worse to earn more profit–but perhaps we can, forewarned, guard against this).
We’re not far from many people spending their entire day with Bluetooth earbuds on, particularly as augmented reality gives us information audibly. And of course, if our ears are connected, the system knows what we’re saying and hearing.
We’re already living in a world where much of what we say and do is intermediated by our phones and keyboards. Again, the system knows.
So… what happens when the AI in our lives begins acting like a thoughtful, patient and trusted friend? Not just like the AI in the movieHer, but more focused on our networks and connections. Who’s trustworthy, talented, available or in need… It knows what’s happening now, but also what happened yesterday. Not just to us, but to those in our circle and the people they know as well…
You’re about to throw out an old board game from the attic. The AI whispers, “Hold a sec, I think a neighbor down the street has been looking for something just like that–want me to sell it to him?”
A company seeking RFPs invites all its suppliers to submit confidential overviews of their supply chain. An AI reads the material and creates Pareto optimal connections, building a confederation of several suppliers who can work together to build something faster and more efficiently than any could do alone.
Your fridge knows you love organic strawberries, and organizes 100 neighbors to buy a farmer’s entire crop, reducing waste and risk and cutting costs for everyone.
Three people are leaving a conference and they’re all calling a car to take them to the airport. Perhaps the AI offers a carpool.
We’re headed off to a community meeting, and we let the AI know that if someone there is hiring for the kind of job we’re good at, we’re open to a connection.
This is a level of intimacy, attention sharing and data that dwarfs anything that has come before, and it brings with it huge issues of permission, control and privacy.
I can think of a thousand ways that this power could be misused, manipulated and go terribly wrong. I have also seen the internet go wrong too. But this is only the beginning of the AI age, and it might help to find a north star, a standard for what happens when the connection machine works for us, instead of against us.","September 17, 2024","AI connections, privacy concerns, digital intimacy"
Vocal fatigue,"Most of us talk, some of us do it for a living.
When your voice is on the fritz, it can affect your entire body as well as the way you approach your day. I’ve read all 25+ of my audiobooks myself, and I used to be able to complete each one in a day or two. Now it takes months. I wanted to share some of what I’ve learned the hard way.
First, a hack:Grether’s pastillesare a miracle. Not cheap, worth it.
Next, if you’re encountering vocal challenges somewhat regularly, consider getting avoice coach.
If it’s chronic, go to an ENT specialist and get scoped. Don’t take steroids unless three different doctors confirm you need them.
One cause of persistent vocal issues could be posture. I’ve found great success with in-person help from a coach certified in the Alexander Technique. It’s not invasive and sort of fun.
But here’s the latest thing I’ve had great results from. It’s free, easy and a little silly, and it really works. The official name for it is a semi-occluded vocal tract exercise, and you can do it two ways:
Get a straw and a tall glass of water, filled about three inches deep. You’re not going to be drinking the water.
First thing: Blow bubbles. Do it calmly and slowly and consistently for a full long breath.
Experiment with changing the shape of your mouth as you do. It’s lovely.
Second thing, which is surprisingly tricky at first: Blow bubbles while you’re humming.

Bye now,"The difference between ‘buy now’ and ‘bye now’ is very thin.
Sometimes, when we push very hard for a commitment, we break the trust we’ve earned.
For a while, you might not notice the broken trust, because we’re encouraged to keep pushing, treating every individual as a walking ATM, not a relationship to be nurtured and a person to be helped.
Soon, though, you run out of the gullible and all you’re left with is distrust.","September 16, 2024","trust, commitment, relationships"
Modern apologies,"The AI driven voice mail system said, “I’m sorry, I didn’t understand you.” Of course, there is no “I” and by most definitions of sorry, it’s not.
But it made me feel better.
The overworked and slightly bitter front desk person who was the frontline flotsam in a poorly designed system couldn’t be bothered. Even though the person they worked for was cancelling the appointment, and I had just spent ten minutes returning their call through a maze of badly designed prompts and it was a hassle to reschedule, they couldn’t/didn’t/wouldn’t say, “I’m sorry.”
After all, they didn’t cancel the appointment or design the system.
“Sorry” doesn’t have to be an admission of guilt or acceptance of fault. It could simply be the kind way one human acknowledges to another human that things aren’t ideal right now.
The magic of this simple word is that it can make both people feel better.","September 15, 2024","apology, empathy, communication"

Banana Equivalents,"Bananas are (slightly) radioactive. Thebanana equivalent dose(BED) is a measurement of radiation. It’s definitely not enough to hurt you.
When we think about risk, the BED is a useful way to find perspective. Is the exposure this new thing will cause on the order of a banana? If so, perhaps we shouldn’t worry about it so much. A chest x ray might be like eating 100 bananas… it gives us a scale we can work with.
Driving a car is far more dangerous than being on an airplane. The Honda Civic dose might be a helpful way to think about the risk of a crash.
And far more people are injured or killed in collisions with deer and moose compared to sharks. The Moose equivalent dose for exposure to wild animals might be worth considering.
Finally, and most salient, the chances that you will experience significant long-term damage from wearing the wrong color shoes to fourth grade, or by asking a dumb question after a presentation are lower than being injured by a pumpkin. And just imagining the pumpkin equivalent dose makes it hard to take ourselves too seriously.","September 13, 2024","Banana Equivalent Dose, Risk Assessment, Radiation"

Better pockets,"Every coat needs better pockets.
There are categories of products or services where there’s a universal area for improvement. When in doubt, make the pockets better.
The interesting work is in realizing that you might offer a product or service where there are non-universal preferences. Areas where improvement isn’t valued.
The Birkin bag is not a good value or particularly functional. That’s okay, that’s part of the appeal.
We might not benefit by always focusing on the pockets.","September 11, 2024","pockets, improvement, preferences"
When did we lose consciousness?,"In medical TV dramas, losing consciousness is something that happens suddenly and dramatically. We can all tell… the body is still there, but the mind is gone, at least for now.
Unfortunately, this happens in real life. At work. In our personal lives. For a few minutes or even a decade or more.
We stop noticing. We fail to appreciate. Most of all, we stop making decisions.
Sheepwalking.
You probably don’t need a medical intervention. Instead, we simply have to find the guts to wake up.
Choice brings responsibility, and responsibility is often accompanied by fear.
That’s okay. You can’t run a marathon without getting tired, and you can’t do important work when you’re asleep.

Ideas travel horizontally.
Not from the creator to the audience as much as from one person to another.
It’s easy to misunderstand the insight of Kevin Kelly’s 1,000 True Fans. Decades ago hearguedthat the long tail is fueled by circles of people who lean in and support a creator’s work. 1,000 people who show up when there’s something important going on. 1,000 fans who care enough to enable an individual to create something worthwhile.
That matters. But that’s not what makes it so powerful.
Ideas that spread win.
The 1,000 fans go first, yes, but they also spread the word. Part of the creator’s job is to give the true fans something worth talking about, something that advances their mission.
When we make spreading the word worthwhile, the word gets spread.
Today, I’m launching my newbookin aspecial packageto 1,000 people.
Click here for more pictures and to order…
It’s seven copies of thebook(which comes out in about six weeks), acollectible chocolate barfrom Askinosie with a trading card inside, a deck of 54strategy cardsand three month’s access topurple.space, including full access to theMarketing SeminarandStrategy Courseas well. The retail value is over $700. I’m working with my publisher and Porchlight to sell the whole box of joy for below cost, less than $125 in the US.
Why overdo it?
Because ideas spread horizontally. Because someone with seven books is likely to give six away. Because I believe that when people have a better understanding of how to use strategy to make things better, they’re going to want to have their colleagues join them on the journey.
And because it’s fun.
It’s fun to interact with the true fans. Your questions and stories and heroics make me think more clearly and find new ways to extend the work. And what an opportunity design and create packaging for chocolate bars, trading cards and a strategy deck as part of my day job.
It all ships in a few weeks. If it’s something you’re interested in, I hope we made enough.

A labor of love,"That’s magical. To have the resources to expend labor on something that fills us with joy.

The bitterness loop,"Spoiled leads to bitter.
A sense of entitlement is a trap, because bitterness demands more evidence and seeks to maintain dominance over the other emotions.
When we’re busy looking for more reasons to be bitter, we’re not taking the time to do generative work, to connect and to find opportunities to make things better. These are the enemies of bitterness… it’s easy to make bitterness worse by seeking more reasons to be bitter.","September 7, 2024","bitterness, entitlement, generative work"
Feeding the algorithm,"The marketing consultant told the client that they have to post three times a day on LinkedIn. “It doesn’t matter if it’s good.”
The SEO consultant explained that the website had to be loaded with keywords, and that a big budget needed to be set aside to develop inbound links.
And the job seeker is instructed to make sure that the resume is AI-friendly and checks every possible box.
Feeding the algorithm works when you’re the only one doing it. It works when you seek to fit right into the middle of the lane. And it works if you’re willing to outfeed everyone else–at least until the algorithm changes.
But while someone is going to win that lottery, it’s probably not going to be you.
The alternative is to be uncomfortable. To create remarkable work and leave scale to others. To figure out how to show up in a way that is generous and distinctive, and to refuse the bait that others take when they decide that feeding the algorithm is their best option.
They call it ‘crowd control’ for a reason. If you’re in a crowd, it’s quite likely someone is trying to control you.
If you’re posting on social media or any platform with an algorithm, the real question is: do you work for the algorithm or are you committed to working for the people who want to go where you hope to take them?","September 6, 2024","Algorithm, Content Creation, Distinctive Work"
Empathy at a distance,"… is almost as difficult as empathy up close.
That person that’s not like you, from way over there, the one that’s on the other team–it’s hard to imagine what they’re dealing with. They don’t believe what you believe, they haven’t experienced what you’ve experienced.
And the person right next to you, the one you’re sure you know so well–they are also dealing with a story and a situation that you can only guess at.

But it’s also a shortcut to persistent dissatisfaction.

The conspiracy of mediocrity,"Solo mediocrity is rampant, of course. We know that toasting the bread before making the sandwich makes it more delicious, but in service of convenience and speed, we skip a step.
It becomes a conspiracy when more than one of us is involved.
The freelancer who offers cheap and ordinary work finds customers who willingly engage with them.
The small company that gets worn down by the constant pressure to simply do a bit less and care a bit less, and decides to follow the mass market where it seems to want to go.
The thing about these conspiracies, though, is that many people have to go along for them to work.
In a big car company, it might take the agreement of 30 or 50 people before the new line gets to be a bit less magical. If just one or two folks stood up and said, “not on my watch,” the conspiracy wouldn’t work.
Like most conspiracies, this one isn’t a secret, nor is it well organized. It’s simply the result of short-term market pressures pushing individuals who used to care a lot to care a bit less.","September 2, 2024","mediocrity, conspiracy, market pressures"
