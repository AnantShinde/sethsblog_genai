“There’s no need for alarm”,"Alarm is overrated.
People say, ""there's no need for alarm,"" as if that rule only applies right now, as if sometimes, thereisa need for alarm.
It turns out that there's never a need for alarm, because alarm doesn't do us any good. Alertness, awareness, action… there's a need for this. But alarm?

Anchoring can sink you,"Canny negotiators know that people respond to anchors. If you tell me that your baseball card is for sale for $18, I'm unlikely to offer you $3. Your offering price anchored the conversation.
The thing is, we do this outside of negotiation, whenever we ask for insight.
If someone says, ""can you review this slide deck?"" there are a bunch of anchors already built in. Anchor: there are slides. Anchor: there are six slides. Anchor: the slides have text on them.
Before we can even have a conversation about whether or not there should even be a presentation, or whether the content is worth presenting, we're already anchored into slides and text and length. The right feedback might be: Do a presentation, but no slides. It might be: Use 100 slides. But these things rarely come up because the entire discussion was anchored at the start.
Great editors, great strategy consultants, great friends–they're generous enough and bold enough to unanchor the conversation and get to the original why at the beginning of a string of decisions.
Once in a while, start with zero, not with what might be the standard right now.

"Loose/tight, thoughts on management","If you have a pad of Post-Its, a watch or a car, it's unlikely you hired and managed a team of people to build it for you. That makes no sense. You knew exactly what you wanted, and you bought a finished product that met spec.
If you do online banking, payroll or even printing, you're doing the same thing. The people at those institutions don't work directly for you, instead they provide a service at arm's length.
So why hire employees?
Sometimes, the work is so custom, we can't easily outsource it.
Sometimes, the work is so time critical or location dependent that we need a staff person here and now.
But mostly, we need the insight and judgment and leverage that employees bring us. All of us are smarter than any of us, and adding people can, if we do it right, make us smarter and faster and better at serving our customers.
It can't work, though, if you insist that the employees read your mind. If you have to spend as much time watching and measuring your team as the team spends working, then you might as well just do the work yourself.
Effective post-industrial organizations have overcome this hurdle by differentiating between the loose and the tight.
Tight control might be appropriate for items like: promises kept, or how we treat our customers, or financial rigor.
Loose principles, on the other hand, might be applied to the way people approach problems, communication methods or less standardized matters like setting and tone.
We fail if we misjudge what ought to be tight. And we guarantee frustration when we're unwilling to let the humans we hire be humans.","February 3, 2016","Management, Employee Insight, Control Dynamics"
The thrill is gone,"Of course it is.
The definition of a thrill is temporary excitement, usually experienced for the first time.
It's thrilling to ride a roller coaster. The fifth time you have to ride it, though, it's more than a chore, it's torture.
The definition of the thrill is that it's going to be gone soon.
You might have been thrilled to go to your first job the first day. Or thrilled to see the first comment on your blog or thrilled the first time one of your books was translated into another language.
But after that? How can repeating it be thrilling?
The work of a professional isn't to recreate thrills. It's to show up and do the work. To continue the journey you set out on a while ago. To make the change you seek to make in the universe.
Thrilling is fine. Mattering is more important.","February 2, 2016","thrill, excitement, professional"
Living with your frustum,"David Bowie left behind an estate worth about $100 million.
And there were perhaps five hundred musicians of his generation who were at least as successful. From Brown to Dylan to Buffet to Ross, there were thirty years of big hit makers.
That's the top of the pyramid. Lots of people tried to make it in the music business, and there were many thousands at the top, hitting a jackpot.
In geometry, a pyramid without a top is called afrustum. Just a base, no jackpot.
The musicindustryis now a classic example…
The bottom is wider than ever, because you don't need a recording studio to make a record. And you don't need a record store to sell one. More musicians making more music than ever before.
And the top is narrower than ever. Fewer hitmakers creating fewer long-term careers. Radio is less important, shelf space is less important, and so the demand for the next big hit from the next reliable hitmaker is diminished. Without Scott Borchetta or someone similar leading you to the few sinecures left, it's almost certain that you'll be without a jackpot.
A similar thing happened to the book business, of course. The big bookstores needed a Stephen King, a Jackie Collins and a Joyce Carol Oates, because they benefitted from having something both reliable and new to put on the shelf. Printing a lot of copies and using a lot of shelf space is a gamble, best to bet on the previous winners. The ebook world doesn't care as much.
The long tail, easy entry, wide distribution model does this to many industries. It's easier than ever to be a real estate broker or to run a tiny dog shelter–easier, but harder to get through theDip.
While the winner-take-all natural monopolies get the headlines and the IPOs, it's not surprising that many industries are frustrating frustums.
The frustration, though, doesn't come from the lack of a top to the pyramid. It comes from acting as if the peak is the point of the entire exercise. For more on this, check out Derek Siver's honest and generousbook.
The good news is that it's entirely possibly you don't need the peak of the pyramid. The leverage that comes from digital tools means that it's entirely possible to do just fine (and have a powerful, positive life) without being David Bowie. Once you know that this is it, perhapsthismight be enough.
Enough to make a difference and enough to make a life.

Considering the nocebo,"The letter to the co-op board sounds likely enough. The tenant is up in arms because air fresheners and other common household odors are seeping into the writer's apartment, giving him severe migraines. What to do about this chemical onslaught?
There's no doubt that these odors are giving the letter writer a debilitating headache, but also little doubt that there isn't a likely double-blind, testable, organic chemistry cause to the headache only in this setting.
The migraine in this case, like many things that bother us, is caused by a nocebo.
A nocebo is aplacebothat makes things worse.
In this case, the lack of control over his home, the unwelcome and unasked for odors, are making him feel trapped, and thus annoyed, and angry, and so they lead to a headache. It's pretty clear to most of us that if that very same bundle of molecules wafted in the door when the clever and happy grandson came to visit, there would be no problem.
Of course the nocebo is real. And eliminating it is a great way to improve your life or the lives of your customers.
The TSA intentionally brings a nocebo to the airport, stressing out innocent travelers. And schools know precisely how to raise the blood pressure of stressed out students. In many situations, loud noises, uncomfortable seats, moments of lost control… these create actual physical discomfort.
We can use the nocebo to give you a headache, a backache, or even a chronic degenerative disease…
But you don't remove the nocebo with medical tests. You remove it with a better story, with a situation that makes us feel powerful and in control, with a setting and a narrative that gives us agency and dignity.
[I'm not asserting that all migraines are caused by nocebos. Far from it. I apologize to anyone who got that impression. But there's plenty ofevidencethat there are very realproblemscaused by nocebos.]","March 31, 2016","nocebo, migraines, control"
Time for a new model?,"Human beings are prediction machines. Successful humans skate to where the puck is going to be, predict what's going to happen next, have an inkling of what's to come.
We do this by creating models. A really good model is a theory, a testable method for asserting what's going to happen next under certain conditions–and being right.
The pundits have models, of course. In writing about thisone, theTimesadmits that they've been consistently wrong–in both directions–with their predictions. But rather than acknowledging that they have a broken model, they persist.
The thing is, when your model doesn't match reality (when you have trouble predicting how your investments will do, whether a sales call will resonate, whether a presentation will work, whether a new hire will work out) it's tempting to blame reality.
Consider that it might be much more effective to get a better model instead.","March 30, 2016","model, predictions, reality"
Big questions before little ones,"Don't finalize the logo before you come up with a business plan that works.
Don't spend a lot of time thinking about your vacation policy before you have a product that people actually want to buy.
There are endless small details to get right before you have something that you're truly proud of. No doubt about it. But there are frightening and huge holes in any bridge to the future, and until you figure out how to get across, I'm not sure it matters if you have a typo on page 4.
Hiding takes many forms. Inappropriate attention to detail is a big one, because it feels like a responsible thing to do.
By all means, get it right. Get it right the first time. Successful makers of change embrace the hierarchy of importance, though, and refuse to engage with a fight about right when it's vitally important to focus on important instead.","March 29, 2016","business planning, prioritization, attention to detail"
Short order cooks rarely make change happen,"How far in the future does your agenda extend?
One way to tell: of the things you worked on last week, how many were due last week?
The marketplace has always tempted us with short-term cycles (they require less trust) and the internet amplifies this temptation to buy fast, sell fast, work fast, measure fast, move on.
But the work that leads to change is rarely written on an order slip or an RFP. Selling to the next buyer is easier than changing the culture, but easier isn't always the point.","March 28, 2016","change, short-term mindset, culture"

But often, particularly in b2b selling, the call to action is very different. ""Get off the tracks! The train is coming…"" combined with the rumble, the smoke and the visuals of the train arriving. That's what causes action.
Action means change and change means fear, so of course we shouldn't be surprised that people (and organizations) are often as motivated by the fear of loss as they are by the desire for gain.","March 27, 2016","b2b selling, fear of loss, change"
Hacking reciprocity,"We're wired to return the favor. When someone opens a door for us, our instinct is to hold the next door for them.
This generous response has led some marketers to aggressively take advantage. They do a favor for someone and then reap the benefits when the favor is returned. All under the guise of, ""I'm helping other people.""
“Helping other people” is not what they're doing.
What they're doing is hacking reciprocity as a tool to help them get what they want. They're trading favors.
Some people have had success with this, but please don’t denigrate the very human activity of actually helping others by conflating it with trading favors.

Because he'll never get elected.
Because we've never done it that way.
Because the buyer will never take it for the store.
Because it's too risky.

Because I'm afraid.
Principle, of course, is for us, not only for other people. One of the great privileges of not living on the edge of disaster is that we have the ability to act on our principles.

The fundamental mismatch error,"""It's me, not you.""
vs.
""It's you, not me.""
What happens when you're unable to serve a customer well, or engage with an employee, or work with a partner?
One instinct is to blame the other person, that your art doesn't match their expectations, and they ought to change, or leave.
And the other is to put the blame on oneself, to state that, ""it's up to me to change to make them happy.""
Either might be true.
For some people, that's hard to swallow, but it's true.
If you're not getting what you seek from the work you do, it could be because your instinct is to go too far in one direction, a belief that doesn't help you very much.
Blame too many other people and you become a lonely diva, bitter and alone.

We can encounter bullies at work, coaching teams and even working in law enforcement. Wherever people organize, they show up.
Coercion gets its start because well-meaning people believe that the short-run cost of the mob mentality is worth it. It almost never is. Coercion uses force and blames the victim. And coercion is impossible to live with.

Survey questions,"Is this a survey or a census?A survey is statistically based, extracting insight from a few and being able to assert its truth across a wider population. A census involves asking everyone, and usually, matching up the answers with the person so you can take further action.
If it's a survey, you probably don't need to reach as many people as you think you do. And if it's a survey, you are almost certainly going to get skewed answers, because surveying the people who answer surveys is truly different from surveying a statistically valid sample of your audience. SurveyMonkey doesn't actually run surveys of your total audience. It runs a poll of people who are willing to answer the questions.
It's pretty easy to survey everyone, ask every customer a question on checkout. In fact, online, it's easier to run something more like a census than a survey, because you merely turn it on and let it run. This is not a smart way to get a statistically accurate insight, but worse, if you run a census, you're wasting an opportunity if you treat it like a survey. If you ask every customer a question, you better be prepared to follow up on every customer who's not happy.
Are you looking for correlations?Causation is almost impossible to find in a survey. But if you're smart, you can learn a lot if you're able to determine that people who said ""B"" in answer to question 3 are also likely to believe ""E"" in answer to question 6. This is a huge step in your ability to determine worldviews and to ultimately treat different people differently.
It doesn't matter if 40% of your customers believe something about price and 39% believe something about features, but if you discover that 98% of the customers who believe this about pricealsobelieve that about quality, you just found something useful.
Is this worth my customer's time?It's super easy to commission a survey. Pay your money and you're done. But then what? Fedex sent Ipsos after me and thousands of other people by phone, wasted more than ten minutes of my time with a survey that never ended, and then they never followed up. Those ten minutes cost Fedex a huge amount of trust and goodwill.
Asking someone to answer a survey has a very real cost. Is the survey worth it?
Are you asking questions capable of making change happen?After the survey is over, can you say to the bosses, ""83% of our customer base agrees with answer A, which means we should change our policy on this issue.""
It feels like it's cheap to add one more question, easy to make the question a bit banal, simple to cover one more issue. But, if the answers aren't going to make a difference internally, what is the question for?
Are you push polling?The questions you ask actually end up changing the person who is responding. Ask me if I'm unhappy and I'm a lot more likely to become unhappy. Ask me who my favorite customer service person is and I'm more likely to look for good customer service people.
This is a challenge that most census-structured customer service surveys have to deal with. If you ask someone if they're satisfied and then don't follow up later, you've just made the problem a lot worse. If you ask your best customers for insight and then ignore it, you've not only wasted the insight, you've wasted goodwill as well.
Here's a simple test I do, something that has never once led to action: In the last question of a sloppy, census-style customer service survey, when they ask, ""anything else?"" I put my name and phone number and ask them to call me. They haven't, never once, not in more than fifty brand experiences.

Hot: A theory of propulsion,"Words are dead.
To be more clear: Words on a page or on a screen are asleep, inert, doing nothing at all until they interact with you, the reader.
That takes effort.
An audiobook, on the other hand, propels itself. The words are spoken, whether you listen or not, so you better listen.
And a video is just as alive.
The next level up isnew. As in news. Or previously unknown. When it's breaking, it propels itself even harder, because we know that we're about to hear something previously unheard.
And beyond that? When humans are involved. Not just news, but news from a friend. News that our peers are about to be talking about. Not just propelled, but amplified by our cohort and our culture.
Social media is built on the idea of propulsion. It's not history, it'snow. The smartphone isn't smart, it's merely hot. Pulsing with the next thing.
[I know, you just got a text. Go check it, I'll be here when you get back.]
This, I think, is one of the giant chasms of our new generation, always seen, not often noticed. That we're moving from the considered words of a book or even a Wikipedia article to the urgent, connected ideas that propel themselves.
Words are a noun, attention is a verb.
The motion of an idea actually creates its own physics. Ideas in motion not only touch more people, they have more impact as well.
Slack is engineered for motion, the Kindle is a silent repository you have to press.
The cliche was that the author used to live for the solitary moments of considered thought and solo writing. ""Leave me alone and let me write."" The publisher paid the bills with the backlist, the old books that sold and sold. Today, without propulsion, most people aren't making the time or the focus to pursue inert wisdom. Without motion, the words get moldy.
Book publishing (and the making of movies, or songs, or articles) has always had an element of promotion associated with it, the act of introducing an idea to someone who needed it. What's shifted is that the promotion has transcended most of the process, because the idea itselfbecomesthe promotion.
It used to be that nothing was more urgent than getting punched in the face. Instant, immediate, personal. Today, we're getting virtual punches, from every direction, all self-propelled, many of them amplified. The ideas that propel themselves on the tailwinds of culture will dominate, opposed only by the people who care enough to propel ideas that matter instead.

The difference between confidence and arrogance,"Confidence is arrogance if the market doesn't believe the story.
When we show up with something great, something generous, well-executed and new, some people will be suspicious. ""Is this everything it's cracked up to be?"" The skeptic wonders if we have the standing to back it up.
You're not going to be able to persuade those skeptics. In fact, when you try, you end up dressing up your confident presentation with too many claims and you risk being seen as merely arrogant.
The classic1984Apple commercial was beautifully confident. It pulled no punches, it was perfectly crafted and it described a product thatsomepeople believed would change their lives.
The1985commercial, though, was perceived as arrogant. Without enough to back it up, the skeptic in us said, ""I don't want this change*, it's not real."" (*the bulk of the market doesn't ever truly want change, because change brings risk and risk brings fear. Give people a chance to avoid change, and they'll likely take it).
The market needs the hubris of high expectations, it's the only thing that seduces some people to embrace change. But the provider (that's us) has to tell a coherent, resonant, true story that touches the right people the right way.","March 13, 2016","Confidence, Arrogance, Market Perception"
Self awareness in the face of marketing,"""I know that this expensive herbal tincture homeopathic remedy is merely an expensiveplacebo. But I'll take it anyway, because placebos work.""
A friend used to wear a fur coat in the winter, telling me that it was the only thing that kept her warm. Of course, if the goal was warmth, she'd probably be better off wearing it inside out.
We buy luxury goods, take placebos and engage in all sorts of actions that aren't going to hold up under the rational analysis of a double-blind study. But they work because we want them to. And often, we want them to because of marketing.
We end up conflating the things we believe with the powerful marketing that got us to believe those things. We feel like questioning the role of marketing is somehow questioning who we are and what we hold dear.
Mostly, marketing is what we call it when someone else is influenced by a marketer. When we're influenced, though, it's not marketing, it's a smart choice.
Do you use that toothpaste because they ran ads that resonated with you, or because you think it actually makes your teeth whiter?
It doesn't have to be this way… The thing is, placebos work even if you're smart enough to know that they're placebos.
Are there primary voters who say, ""I know that hecraves attention, hustling and manipulating to sell emotional promises, not realistic action, but I'm going to vote for him anyway, because it makes me feel powerful to do so…""?
As soon as that self-awareness kicks in, it's possible to be more discerning about what you believe and why.
Or are there mindful people who say, ""there's no clear right answer in this conflict, but my people, my folks, we have always supportedthisside, so I'm going to keep doing that, because breaking with them is too painful…""?
As soon as you ask that question, it's a lot easier to have a civil, productive conversation, because instead of wearing yourself out arguing tropes, you can talk about the actual issue, which is belonging to a tribe. We can talk about how we work through the cultural change to get to a new place, not have an argument about history.
Marketing works. It's powerful. We're able to acknowledge that and see it for what it is without giving up what we choose to believe.
We can create better decisions and more amity by being clear with ourselves and others about how marketing is changing what we believe (and vice versa).
It's a lot harder to be manipulated if you accept that there's a manipulator, and it's a lot easier to see a path forward if you acknowledge that you weren't looking for one before.","March 12, 2016","self-awareness, marketing, consumer behavior"
Galvanized,"When George Martin first met the Beatles and became their producer, he liked their sound and their energy, but he didn't think they could write songs. So he licensed a song, handed it to them and had them record it. John and Paul hated doing this, so they asked if they could write one. That became their first hit. Faced with opposition and competition, they became better songwriters.
Sir George didn't think much of Pete Best, their drummer, and he said so. He wanted to hire session musicians as drummers. Faced with a loss of cohesion and control, John, Paul and George took action, fired Pete, found and hired Ringo.
George didn't think there was a chance this Ringo guy was any good, so he had a session musician sit in for the first recording. Ringo brought his A game on the next track and that was the end of session musicians sitting in.
Often, our best work happens when we're in a situation we wouldn't have chosen for ourselves. The hard part is choosing to be in that sort of situation in the first place, the uncomfortable one where we have no choice but to do better work.

On the other hand, the traditional wisdom is that you should tell very few people about your go up goals. Don't tell them you intend to get a promotion, win the race or be elected prom king. That's because even your friends get jealous, or insecure on your behalf, or afraid of the change your change will bring.
Here's the thing: If that's the case,you need better friends.
A common trait among successful people is that they have friends who expect them to move on up.","March 10, 2016","goals, support, friendships"
Are they ready for you yet?,"Most of the time, we don’t go first. There are good reasons for this (the iWatch comes to mind). With the exception of sushi and fresh powder, there’s little cultural or economic advantage to always trying the new thing first.
Change happens because some people, some of the time, have neophilia. We are dissatisfied enough or passionate enough that we seek out the new thing, mostly because it's new. This is the chowhound who seeks out the latest restaurant, or the idealist who supports the newest policy proposal.
But a surprisingly small percentage of the population has neophilia. So movie studios work to share almost the entire movie in the TV ads before opening weekend, because they know most people don't actually want to be surprised and take a risk, even at the movies. And so Kickstarter makes it easy to jump in at just the right moment, after an idea is sure to work, not when it's merely an idea. (This is now working for somecharitiesas well).
Project creators have to wrestle with thischasm. First, there's the thrill of the launch, and then the gratifying response from the early adopters. (Note that they are not calledadapters, for a good reason). But then, then there's a trough,the period between the excitement of the new and the satisfaction of the proven.
It can take days or years to get to proven. To get to the moment when you can honestly say, ""it's ready for you now."" Nothing new is for everyone. By definition, the new is for a few, those that see a benefit in going first.
This week,applications are open for altMBA5. There's only a week left before our first deadline. Over the last year, hundreds of people like you have enrolled in this four-week intensive workshop, and have come away changed, working at a higher level, seeing things differently, contributing in ways that truly matter.
Please take just a moment to read thesetestimonialsfrom our students.
We're ready for you now.
We used to be new, now we're proven. That's something that every project that crosses the chasm has to be able to demonstrate.
The altMBA is the most effective transformation tool I've ever created. More than books or blog posts, this extraordinary group sprint is the agent of change I've been seeking, and I think, so have you.
I hope to see you there. We're ready. Are you?","March 9, 2016","neophilia, altMBA, transformation"
Freedom and responsibility,"Which do you want?
Freedom is the ability to set your schedule, to decide on the work you do, to make decisions.
Responsibility is being held accountable for your actions. It might involve figuring out how to get paid for your work, owning your mistakes or having others count on you.
Freedom without responsibility is certainly tempting, but there are few people who will give you that gig and take care of you and take responsibility for your work as well.
Responsibility without freedom is stressful. There are plenty of jobs in this line of work, just as there are countless jobs where you have neither freedom nor responsibility. These are good jobs to walk away from.
When in doubt, when you're stuck, when you're seeking more freedom, the surest long-term route is to take more responsibility.
Freedom and responsibility aren't given, they're taken.","March 8, 2016","Freedom, Responsibility, Accountability"
The dominant narrative,"Life is filled with nuance.
Our ability to perceive things, not so much.
We come up with a story (about an organization, a person, a situation) and all the data that supports it, we notice, and the nuance we discount or ignore.
So, if you believe that Whole Foods is expensive, you won't notice the items that are a little cheaper, but the overpriced things that confirm your narrative will be obvious.
If you believe that your boss is cold-hearted, you'll gloss over the helpful moments and remind yourself of the other times.
We engage in this narrative and people do it to us as well, and to our brands and our institutions, all the time. Insisting that they see the whole truth isn't going to be a productive strategy.
It's easy to pretend that the dominant narrative is insightful, based in reality and in sync with what we wish it was. Denying it doesn't make it go away, though.
We can't easily change the dominant narrative that people have about us, we certainly can't do it by insisting that our customers or colleagues bring more nuance to the table.
Instead, we can do it through action. Vivid, memorable interactions are what people remember. Surprises and vivid action matter far more than we imagine, and we regularly underinvest in them.","March 7, 2016","dominant narrative, perception, action"
Listening to smart vs. I’m with stupid,"In what areas have you found that you benefit from listening to someone who's really smart about the decision you need to make?
Not a self-appointed expert, but someone with experience, patience and maturity, someone who's been educated in the field, practiced in it, someone who understands the history and the mechanics of what's on offer…
Certainly, most of us would agree that in areas like removing a tumor, investing a nest egg or even baking a loaf of bread, listening to these folks is the way to go. Ignoringallof them is foolhardy.
Sometimes, in our search for the new thing, we mistakenly grab the foolish thing instead. ""I'm with stupid.""
Challenging the status quo and going against all the the traditional rules of thumb is a great way to take a leap. But that sort of leap needs to be a portfolio play, part of a larger arc, not a matter of life and death, not the last spin of the wheel you're going to get if you're wrong.
[Worth noting that plenty of smart people shunned Semmelweis, Lovelace and Alan Kay. But notallof the smart people.]
By all means, take these intellectual risks. But not when you're skydiving. Being uninformed doesn't make you a renegade. It merely makes you uninformed.","March 6, 2016","expertise, decision-making, risk-awareness"
On saying “no”,"If you're not proud of it, don't serve it.
If you can't do a good job, don't take it on.
If it's going to distract you from the work that truly matters, pass.
If you don't know why they want you to do this, ask.
If you need to hide it from your mom, reconsider.
If it benefits you but not the people you care about, decline.
If you're going along with the crowd, that's not enough.
If it creates a habit that costs you in the long run, don't start.
If it doesn't move you forward, hesitate then walk away.
The short run always seems urgent, and a moment where compromise feels appropriate. But in the long run, it's the good 'no's that we remember.
On the other hand, there's an imperative to say ""yes."" Say yes and build something that matters.","March 5, 2016","boundaries, decision-making, priorities"
Special orders don’t upset us,"You ask the waiter to bring you the mackerel, but without the teriyaki glaze. He says, ""the menu says no substitutions, I'm sorry.""
There's absolutely nothing wrong with running an establishment around the idea that it is what it is, here it is, you can have it if you want to buy it.
You ask the waiter to bring you the mackerel, but without the teriyaki glaze. He says, ""Certainly. Is there anything else I can offer to make it even more to your liking?""
Again, that's a fine strategy. It recognizes that eating out is a choice, and that this establishment is in the business of treating different people differently.
Do you know what's not okay? ""Well, we don't like to do this, but just this one time, I'll ask the chef, but I hope it's the only thing you want changed.""","March 4, 2016","special orders, customer service, dining experience"
The front row culture,"The group files into the theater, buzzing. People hustle to get to the front row, sitting side by side, no empty seats. The event starts on time, the excitement is palpable.
The other group wanders in. The front row is empty and stays that way. There are two or even three empty seats between each individual. The room is sort of dead.
In both cases, the CEO or the guest speaker is going to address the group for an hour. But the two groups couldn't be more different.
The first organization sees possibility, the second sees risk and threat. The first group is eager to explore a new future, the second group misses the distant past.
The truth is this: it's possible to hire for, train for and lead a front-row organization. And if you merely let entropy take over, you're going to end up with the second, lesser, failing organization instead.
Worth saying this as clearly as possible: The culture, the choice of front row or back row, is a choice. It's the result of investment and effort.
Where would you rather work?","March 3, 2016","Front row culture, organizational mindset, employee engagement"
“Will this be on the test?”,"There, in six words, is one of the worst questions any educator can hear.
It lays bare, in a simple question, the motivations, the structures and the flaws of the traditional educational paradigm. The test is a stick, the grade (and the degree) are the carrot, and compliance is the process.
I just published a longMedium postabout how this mindset was the unseen standard as educators moved online, and why it can’t work (and what we can do about it.) I hope you'll take a minute to check it out.","March 2, 2016","educational paradigm, online learning, assessment mindset"
Reading between the lines,"If you've ever been rejected (grad school, an article submission, a job) you may have spent some time analyzing the rejection letter itself, reading between the lines, trying to figure out why you were actually rejected.
The thing is, there's almost nothing written between lines.
People rarely say what they mean when they reject you. It's just not worth the risk. Not worth saying, ""I'm filled with fear about taking this sort of chance on you."" Not worth the blowback of saying, ""you're a miserable writer, the bane of my existence, and you will never amount to anything."" It'll just come back to haunt them.
And of course, if you do read that sort of apparently honest screed in a rejection letter, it's just as likely to be about the writer as it is about you and your work.
Make a pile of the thousands of rejection letters that successful people have received over the years and analyze them for insights and patterns—you won't find much of use.
Short version: You got rejected. The words and the tone of the rejection aren't going to tell you much, and every moment you spend dissecting them is a way to hide from the real work of making something that will resonate tomorrow.
If you really want to know why someone didn't like your work, you're going to have to put a lot more effort into it understanding the person who rejected you. Reading the tea leaves in the rejection letters and one-star reviews is pretty worthless.","March 1, 2016","rejection, analysis, insights"
Errors in scale,"A restaurant that's too small for its following creates pent-up demand and can thrive as it lays plans to expand.
A restaurant that's too big merely fails.

Your money and your future,"Your money:Almost no one knows how to think about money and investing. Squadrons of people will try to confuse you and rip you off. Many will bore you. But Andrew Tobias has written a book that might just change your net worth.
His advice is simple: spending less is even more valuable than earning more. He is also a gifted writer, funny and dead on correct in his analysis. Highly recommended.
The brand new edition isright here.
Back story: 32 years ago this month, I had lunch with Andy Tobias. I was pitching him on a partnership, and the meeting had been difficult to get. I was intimidated and soaking wet from running fifty blocks through Manhattan (no Uber!). As I sat in the New York Athletic Club, my cheap suit dripping wet (you can't take off your jacket at the New York Athletic Club), I tried to break the ice by telling themoose joke.
I told it pretty well, but Andy didn't crack a smile. Even then, he was a canny negotiator. We never ended up working together, but his book probably did me more good than the project would have. And the story was priceless.
Your future:Kevin Kelly is the most erudite, original and prophetic futurist of our time. If you've ever picked up a copy ofWired, he's had an impact on your life.
If you hope to be working, producing value or merely alive in ten years, hisnew book(out in June) is essential. It might take you an hour or two to read certain pages—if you're smart enough to take notes and brainstorm as you go.
The people who read his previous book about the future (New Rules) in 1998 are truly grateful for the decade-long head start it gave them.
I've never had the nerve to tell Kevin a joke, but I didoffer to do a magic trickfor him.
It's rare that you can spend $33 on two books and have your life so profoundly altered.

Closing the gate,"Sooner or later, tribes begin to exclude interested but unaffiliated newcomers.
It happens to religious sects, tosurfersand to online communities as well. Nascent groups with open arms become mature groups too set in their ways to evangelize and grow their membership, too stuck to engage, change and thrive.
So much easier to turn someone away than it is to patiently engage with them, the way you were welcomed when you were in their shoes.
There are two reasons for this:
And so, Wikipedia has transformed itself into a club that's not particularly interested in welcoming new editors.
And the social club down the street has a membership with an average age of 77.
And companies that used to grow by absorbing talent via acquisitions, cease to do so.
This cycle isn't inevitable, but it takes ever more effort to overcome our inertia.
Even if it happens gradually, the choice to not fight this inertia is still a choice. And while closing the gate can ensure stability and the status quo (for now), it rarely leads to growth, and ultimately leads to decline.
[Some questions to ponder…]
Do outsiders get the benefit of the doubt?
Do we make it easy for outsiders to become insiders?
Is there a clear and well-lit path to do so?
When we tell someone new, ""that not how we do things around here,"" do we also encourage them to learn the other way and to try again?
Are we even capable of explaining the status quo, or is the way we do things set merely because we forgot that we could do it better?
Is a day without emotional or organizational growth a good day?",,"inclusivity, growth, inertia"
Transformation tourism,"""I bought the diet book, but ate my usual foods.""
""I filled the prescription, but didn't take the meds.""
""I took the course… well, I watched the videos… but I didn't do the exercises in writing.""
Merely looking at something almost never causes change. Tourism is fun, but rarely transformative.
If it was easy, you would have already achieved the change you seek.
Change comes from new habits, from acting as if, from experiencing the inevitable discomfort of becoming.","April 28, 2016","transformation, habits, change"
Just a little more,"It's often about asking, not about what's needed.
Years ago, when I lived in California, I'd go to the grocery store nearly every day. I usually paid by check. Each time, the clerk would ask me for my phone number and then write it on the check.
When I ran out of checks, I decided to be clever and had my phone number printed on them. You guessed it, without missing a beat, that same clerk started asking me for my driver's license number (and yes, I did it one more time, and we moved on to my social security number).
The information wasn't the point. It was the asking, the time taken to look closely at the document.
It's tempting to listen to our customers (""why aren't there warm nuts in first class?"") and then add the features they request. But often, you'll find that these very same customers are asking for something else. Maybe they don't actually want a discount, just the knowledge that they tried to get one.
What's really happening here is that people are seeking the edges, trying to find something that gets a reaction, a point of failure, proof that your patience, your largesse or your menu isn't infinite. Get patient with your toddler, and you might discover your toddler starts to seek a new way to get your attention. Give that investigating committee what they're asking, and they'll ask for something else.
They're not looking for one more thing, they're looking for a 'no', for acknowledgment that they reached the edge. That's precisely what they're seeking, and you're quite able to offer them that edge of finiteness.
Sometimes, ""no, I'm sorry, we can't do that,"" is a feature.","April 27, 2016","customer feedback, boundaries, acknowledgment"
Perfect; could be better,"When we run a new session of thealtMBA, we ask each student to write a short bio and submit a picture.
A week later, we share the nicely laid out PDF with the extraordinary class that has been assembled and then give people a week to update their bio for mistakes, etc.
Inevitably, the bios (and the photos) get better. A lot better.
It's not because people didn't try the first time. It's because being surrounded by people on the same journey as you causes you to level up.
Your path forward is pretty simple: Decide on your journey and find some people who will cause you to level up.

If you're curious as to what we teach, here is some feedback from our alumni:
altMBA helped remind me that you are never too busy to do work that truly matters.  Clarissa Finks, altMBA3,Burton Snowboards
The altMBA taught me that there is no limit on empathy, or its positive and powerful application in business.  Matt Hill, altMBA3,National Parks at Night
Before the altMBA, I thought I was alone and that I needed other people’s help to succeed. After the altMBA, I know that I am not alone and that the right people will succeed with me.  Thejus Chakravarthy, altMBA4,Korin
The altMBA taught me that it is my turn to speak up about things that matter, that changing the world can start with me. Heatherlee Nguyen, altMBA3,Optum(UnitedHealth Group)
The altMBA taught me that fear is not an excuse, and helped me learn how to silence my lizard brain. I am more confident, lighter, and confident in my ability to create the change in the world that I want to see. I was a dreamer, now I am a doer.  Alexa Rohn, AltMBA4,alexarohn.com
altMBA taught me that every decision, be it to ship, to sell, to connect or to understand another is rooted in emotion. The more you understand those emotions the better your product, pitch, friendship and leadership will resonate.   Alicia Johnson, altMBA4,City of San Francisco Emergency Management
The altMBA taught me that opportunity is a decision and it’s mine to make.  Derek W. Martin, altMBA1,tuba

The tidal wave is overrated,"Yes, it can lead to wholesale destruction, but it's the incessant (but much smaller) daily tidal force that moves all boats, worldwide.
And far more powerful than either is the incredible impact of seepage, of moisture, of the liquid that makes things grow.
Facebook and other legendary companies didn't get that way all at once, and neither will you.
We can definitely spend time worrying about/building the tsunami, but it's the drip, drip, drip that will change everything in the long run.","April 25, 2016","tidal force, incremental change, long-term impact"
The other kind of power move,"In the common vernacular, a power move is something that gets done to you.
The person with power demands an accommodation, or switches the venue, or has an admin call you instead of calling you himself. Someone with a resource who makes you jump a little higher before he shares it…
Little diva-like gestures to reinforce who has the upper hand.
But what about moves that are based on connection, or generosity, or kindness?
Those take real power.","April 24, 2016","power move, connection, generosity"
Supply and demand,"Just because you have a supply (a skill, an inventory, a location) that doesn't necessarily mean you are entitled to demand.
The market decides what it wants. You can do your best to influence that choice, but it's never (alas) based on what you happen to already have.
There's a reason that garage sale prices tend to be pretty low.
We can get pretty self-involved on supply, forgetting that nothing works without demand.","April 23, 2016","supply, demand, market"
Turning paradoxes into problems,"A problem is open to a solution. That what makes it a problem.
A paradox, on the other hand, is gated by boundaries that make a solution impossible.
If you've been working on a situation, chewing on it, throwing everything you've got at it, it might not be a problem at all. You may have invented a paradox, creating so many limits that you'll never get anywhere.
It makes no sense to work on a paradox. Drop it and move on. Even better, figure out which boundaries to remove and turn it into a problem instead.
Two examples: Building a worldwide limo fleet is impossible, a paradox that requires too much money and too much time–by the time you raised enough money and hired enough supervisors, you'd never be able to charge enough to earn it back. But once you ease the boundary of, ""if you own a transport service, you must own the cars and hire the drivers,"" the idea of building a network is merely a problem.
Another more general one: Making significant forward motion without offending anyone or exposing yourself to fear is a paradox. But once you're willing to relax those boundaries, it becomes a problem, one with side effects you're willing to live with…","April 22, 2016","paradoxes, problems, boundaries"
Processing feedback,"This is one of the most important untaught skills available to each of us.
Three times in a row, a salesperson is rejected by one prospect after another.
A customer complains to a company that its website is not working with her browser.
An editor rejects the manuscript from a first-time novelist…
What to do?
How do we deal with the troll who enjoys creating uncertainty? Or the person carrying around a bagful of pain that she needs to share? How do we differentiate between constructive, useful insight and the other kind? How do we decide which feedback is actually a clue about how our core audience feels, and which is a distraction, a shortcut on the road to mediocre banality?
If you listen to none of the feedback, you will learn nothing. If you listen to all of it, nothing will happen.
Like all life skills, there's not a glib answer.
But we can definitely ask the questions. And get better at the art of listening (and dismissing).
The place to start is with two categories. The category of, ""I actively seek this sort of feedback out and listen to it and act on it."" And the category of, ""I'm not interested in hearing that."" There is no room for a third category.","April 21, 2016","Feedback, Listening, Constructive criticism"
Numbers (and the magic of measuring the right thing),"What you measure usually gets paid attention to, and what you pay attention to, usually gets better.
Numbers supercharge measurement, because numbers are easy to compare.
Numbers make it difficult to hide.
And hence the problem.
Income is easy to measure, and so we fall into the trap that people who make more money are better, or happier, or somehow more worthy ofrespect and dignity.
Likes are easy to measure, so social media becomes a race to the bottom, where the panderer and the exhibitionist win.
Five star reviews are easy to measure, so creators feel the pressure to get more of them.
But wait!
What does it mean to 'win'? Is maximizing the convenient number actually going to produce the impact and the outcome you wanted?
Is the most important work always the most popular? Does widespread acceptance translate into significant impact? Or even significant sales? Is the bestseller list also the bestbook list?
Who are these reviews from? Are they based on expectations (a marketing function) or are they based on the change you were trying to make? It turns out that great books and great movies get more than their fair share of lousy reviews–because popular items attract more users, and those users might not be people you were seeking to please.
Or consider graduation rates. The easiest way to make them go up is to lower standards. Or to get troublesome students to transfer to other institutions or even to get them arrested. When we lose track of what's important in our rush to keep track of what's measurable, we fail.
The right numbers matter. A hundred years ago, Henry Ford figured out how to build a car far cheaper than his competitors. He was selling the Model T for a fraction of what it cost other companies to evenmakeone of their cars. And so measuring the cost of manufacture became urgent and essential.
And farmers discovered the yield was the secret to their success, so tons per acre became the most important thing to measure. Until people started keeping track of flavor, nutrition and side effects.
And then generals starting measuring body count…
When you measure the wrong thing, you get the wrong thing. Perhaps you can be precise in your measurement, butprecision is not significance.
On the other hand, when you are able to expose your work and your process to the right thing, to the metric that actually matters, good things happen.
We need to spend more time figuring out what to keep track of, and less time actually obsessing over the numbers that we are already measuring.","April 20, 2016","Measurement, Significance, Metrics"
Abstaining,"Not voting leads to an outcome as much as voting does. You're still responsible, even if you didn't actively participate.
In any situation, not stating your opinion allows things to move forward. Silence is not nothing, it is still an action.
No sense hiding, from yourself or anyone else.","April 19, 2016","abstaining, responsibility, silence"
It feels risky,"Risk and the appearance of risk aren't the same thing.
In fact, for most of us, they rarely overlap.
Realizing that there's a difference is the first step in making better decisions.","April 18, 2016","risk, decision-making, perception"
"Awareness, trust and action","Marketing outreach (ads, PR, sponsorships, etc.) is not about one thing. It's about three things.
Awarenessis a simple ping: Oh, she's running for President. Oh, they just opened one in our neighborhood. Oh, they're having a sale.
Trustis far more complicated. Trust comes from experience, from word of mouth, from actions noted. Trust, amazingly, also seems to come from awareness. ""As seen on TV"" is a perverse way to claim trust, but in fact, when people are more aware of what you do, it often seeps into a sort of trust.
Andactionis what happens when someone actually goes and votes, or buys something, or shows up, or talks about it. And action is as complex as trust. Action requires overcoming the status quo, action means that someone has dealt with the many fears that come with change and felt that fear and still done something.
Many people reading this are aware that they can buy a new mattress, and might believe it's worth the effort, but don't take action.
Many people reading this are aware that they can buy a tool, get some treatment, visit a foreign land, listen to a new recording… but action is the difficult part.
Action is quite rare. For most people, the story of 'later' is seductive enough that it appears better to wait instead of leaping.
As a marketer, then, part of the challenge is figuring out which of the three elements you need the most help with, and then focus on that…","April 17, 2016","Awareness, Trust, Action"
I am not a brand,"You are not a brand.
You're a person.
A living, breathing, autonomous individual who doesn't seek to maximize ROI or long-term brand value.
You have choices. You have the ability to change your mind. You can tell the truth, see others for who they are and choose to make a difference.
Selling yourself as a brand sells you too cheap.
(Actually, if a brand is nothing but the promises made and kept and the expectations we have, then yes, I guess you are a brand. The modern kind, the brand where connection matters a lot more than ads or hype.)","April 16, 2016","individuality, authenticity, connection"
Apocalypse soon,"It's a bug in our operating system, and one that's amplified by the media.
I'm listening to a speech from ten years ago, twenty years ago, forty years ago… ""During these tough times… these tenuous times… these uncertain times…"" And we hear about the urgency of the day, the bomb shelters, the preppers with their water tanks, the hand wringing about the next threat to civilization.
At the same time that we live in the safest world that mankind has ever experienced. Fewer deaths per capita from all the things that we worry about.
Risky? Sure it is. Every moment for the last million years has been risky. The risk has moved from Og with a rock to the chronic degeneration of our climate, but it's clear that rehearsing and fretting and worrying about the issue of the day hasn't done a thing to actually make it go away. Instead, we amplify the fear, market the fear and spread the fear as a form of solace, of hiding from taking action, of sharing our fear in a vain attempt to ameliorate it.
When we get nostalgic for past eras, for their culture or economy or resources, it's interesting that we never seem to get nostalgic for their fears.","April 15, 2016","apocalypse, fear, nostalgia"
The foggy mirror,"Most people can't resist a mirror. It makes the wait for an elevator more palatable, and we can't help checking–how do I look?
In many ways, though, this is futile, because we can never know how we look through other people's eyes.
No one else has lived your life, heard all of your jokes, experienced your disappointments, listened to the noise in your head. As a result, no one else sees you (and your actions) quite the way you do.
And, to magnify the disconnect, every single person has their own narrative, so even when two people see you at the same time, they have different interpretations of what just happened, what was just said.
The same goes for brands and organizations. No one has experienced your brand or your product the way you have. They don't know about the compromises and choices that went into it. They don't understand the competitive pressures or the mis-steps either.
Even the best quality mirror tells you very little. It doesn't make a lot of sense to focus on this sort of grooming if you want to understand what customers or friends are going to see. Far better to watch what they do.

Sharpening failure,"Losing the election by ten votes or by a million–which is worse?
""Missed it bythat much,"" is a way to amplify how we feel when we don't succeed. So, when we miss the bus by just a few seconds, or finish a math proof just behind the competition–we can beat ourselves up about this for years.
Much rarer, it seems, is the opposite. It's hard to find people still congratulating themselves after winning an election by just a few votes or making a plane by a step or two. Nice that it happened, but we ask what's next, where's the next crisis?
We have a name for someone who expects the worst in the future. Pessimism is a choice. But we don't seem to have a name for someone who describes the past with the same negative cast.
It's a dangerous trap, the regular reminders of how we've failed, but how close we've come to winning. It rarely leads us to prepare more, to be more adroit or dedicated. Instead, it's a form of hiding, a way to insulate ourselves from the next, apparently inevitable failure.
The universe is not laughing at us. It doesn't even know we exist.
Go ahead and celebrate the wins, then get back to work. Same for mourning the losses. All we can do is go forward.

Conspicuous mediocrity,"Luxury goodsoriginated as a way for the wealthy to both show off their resources and possess a scarce, coveted item of better functionality.
Over time, as luxury goods have become more competitive (it's a profitable niche if you can find it) a variation is becoming more common: goods and services that aren't better (in fact, in some cases, not even that good). At some level, they're proud of this inferiority.
The thinking is, ""If you have to ask if it's any good, you can't afford it.""
And so we have cars, hotels and restaurants that are far more expensiveanddramatically inferior to what a smart shopper could have chosen instead. What's for sale isn't performance or reliability. Merely exclusivity.
They offer the customer the satisfaction of looking around the room and saying, ""yep, I'm here.""
But it's a risky strategy, because sooner or later the frequent breakdowns, the lousy service or the poor design communicate to the well-heeled customer, ""this merely makes me look stupid.""

Our software must get better,"“That’s good enough, let’s move on”
Lots of things could be better (cars, buildings, candy, etc.) but we understand that the cost of pushing through to the next level is prohibitive. It might be because, as in the case of candy, the mass market just won’t pay for premium ingredients, or, in the case of buildings, the cost of retrofitting the billions of buildings in the world is just too big to fix the stuff that’s already out there.
The building doesn’t fall down, it sort of works, better than good enough, let’s move on.
But software, software is different. Consider:
1. one piece of software can be used by a billion people, no extra cost per person. Unlike candy or anything physical, it doesn’t cost more per user (not a penny more) to have more people use great software instead of settling for good software.
And
2. fixing software today fixes it for everyone, in the world, going forward (and for connected computers, going backward as well).
Imagine what would happen if this were true for buildings… if the efficiency and style and ambience of every building in the world could be fixed, all at once, in exchange for one investment.
Alas, software tends to be mediocre. There are a few reasons for this:
A. Lock in means that once someone has a success (and the cash flow that comes with it) there’s not much incentive to invest a lot in fixing it (fixing it looks a lot like breaking it, at least at first). Which is why Paypal has had such a miserable user interface for so long. (Do the folks at Paypal know how bad it is? Don't they care?)
B. As software gets more successful, the instinct is to hiremorepeople to work on it (which increases complications and errors dramatically) and to be ever more conservative as well (don’t mess with what’s working).
C. Perhaps the biggest problem: In many markets, especially online, software is free. And free software built by corporations turns us from the user into the product. If you're not paying for it, after all, you must be the bait for the person who is. Which means companies spend time figuring out how to extract value once we're locked in and can't easily switch.
I’ve been developing software on and off since1984, and empathize with the people who have to make these decisions. But software is too important to be mediocre.
CompareRoonto iTunes (which has had countless iterations, but never seems to get better, it merely helps Apple sell more of something).
The Roon user experience is fabulous.The only reason they could launch it in the face of a free competitor is that enough people care about music. Which means that software as a service in this area has a shot for a revenue stream that can justify the investment, but even with a demonstrably better product, competing with free, with software installed by default, this is really hard work.
Or compare the heavily promoted (but awful) stamps.com to the elegant but little known alternative, Endicia. It works on the Mac, does tracking, it actually works. Better software, worth it.
Or consider the Address Book built into your Mac, a piece of software that only is used because it's free and hardwired in. It's difficult to import or export data, and it's truly slow. No one, not one person, is happy about how this software helps them work. Without a reasonable business model, though, competing with free is incredibly difficult.
When you can, insist on paying for your software. Our instinct to take the free stuff is often a bad long-term choice—it takes a committed team to keep free software worth the trust we put into it.

The confusion kicks in when we become overwhelmed by all the things we can do, but can’t find the time or the courage to actually commit and follow through.

Choose your role,"In many creative endeavors, we encounter:
The producer, the director, the star and the star's assistant.
The producer initiates. The producer says ""yes.""
The director (and often, the writer, a different version of directing) determines the plot, makes the decisions, owns the quality of what is produced.
The star is a celebrity, the draw, the one we want a selfie with. The star auditions and the star waits to be picked.
And the star's assistant? He gets coffee, copyedits, and generally gets unglamorous stuff done, but gets the satisfaction of steady work plus the chance to say he works for a star.
A survey of high school students found that they'd rather be a star's assistant than a judge, a senator or a CEO when they grew up. Safety near the spotlight.
I've done all of these jobs (sometimes at the same time, on the same project) and, for the right project, you can choose from any of them as well.
The assistant can't do the work without a star. The star needs to be chosen by the director. And the director needs a producer. But the producer–the producer gets to decide.
It's easy to be seduced into believing that you must wait to be picked, and even easier to worship those that have. It's far more interesting and generous, I think, to find the leverage and the guts you need to produce, to become the impresario, the one who says 'go'.

An interesting alternative to primaries,"Presidential primaries in the US have several problems. We do it the way we do it because that's the usual way, not because it works particularly well.
The biggest problem is that the people who vote are usually the most political, which means that winning a primary involves going hard to one edge or another. Instead of electing for consistent productive consensus we nominate for short-term TV sound bytes.
The next is polling. The media plus lack of official information equals tons of guessing, and as the primaries warm up, polling becomes the dominant driver of what happens next. Which would be fine, except the polls are often dramatically incorrect, and polls are not votes.
The media are turning this more and more into a sporting event, and the polls are the play by play, except they’re being done in the dark.
A bigger problem is the uneven influence of voting. Some votes are worth a huge amount (New Hampshire!) while others often don’t have any impact whatsoever. The voting takes many forms—anonymous, public, sorted by party, crossover, etc.
These two problems lead to the biggest one: Parties often don’t nominate their best candidate (where ‘best’ might mean electable or talented, you pick).
Instead of building a growing cohort of excited, committed voters, more often than not the primary process disconnects those that made the 'wrong' commitment early on.
Consider for a moment a party that chose instead to run its primary on Facebook.
Before you list your objections, some of the features:
Everyone would vote six times over six months. Only the last vote would count in the final results, the first five are sort of a live poll, a straw poll for preference.
The voting wouldn’t happen in one day, it would take place over a week, with the results tabulated in real time. So you could see how the tide was moving and choose to either engage your friends to push back, or to join in. True fans would vote early and in public, while the undecided might see what's happening.
Each vote would be for three candidates, in order, from most favorite to ‘I can live with this’. This method of voting has been shown to allow consensus candidates to rise to the top, diminishing the voice of the angry few.
Each vote might also include a chance to vote for your favorite candidate of the other party, further increasing options for consensus.
Votes could either be in public or anonymized. The advantage of public voting (like a caucus) is that it gets to a truer sense of democracy, in that choices are more easily talked about. But for the reluctant citizen, the vote could be tallied but not identified with a specific individual in public.
Because the votes aren’t anonymous in the database, it would be easy to track changes over time. People who supported X are now moving toward Y. When we're talking about a mass phenomenon like voting, it's these shifts that matter. Cultural shift is how pop music works, and it never fails to create a profitable top 40.
The kind of polling we’re used to would become obsolete. Too much good data to worry much about making data up.
On the other hand, actual polling based on data analysis of the detailed Facebook corpus would mean that the public (and their candidates) would have much better insight into what people actually want.
This fits in perfectly withthe debate channel.
It seems to me that if one party does this, they end up with a candidate that's less bloodied, more engaged and more connected to the public, putting the other party at a significant disadvantage.
As to the most common objections:
A.This is new. It might not work.Absolutely, agreed. Does what we have now work? It costs more than a billion dollars. It occupies a year of our lives, every four. Do you have a better idea?
For me, this is an okay place to experiment, because the primary is merely the party's chance to figure out how to run a candidate. As a result, it's always been quasi-official and always been a mess.
B.There are all sorts of opportunities for fraud.Yes, absolutely, But almost certainly only on the margins, probably no worse than we have now, particularly when you consider the tiny number of actual voters in the current system.
I'm imagining a public, transparently run app that lives within Facebook. Hard to do, difficult, risky. But probably better than the current alternative.
C.Some people don’t have Facebook. Yes, but in four years, far fewer won't have access, and we still have the library. Spend some of the millions and millions of dollars we spend on elections outfitting libraries with more computers instead. Because the voting takes place over a week, no issue with lines, nor hanging chad. It's worth noting that today, in order to be an effective voter, you need a TV and a car, both of which were new technologies a hundred years ago.

And what else will you lie about?,"When did companies start talking about, ""unexpectedly high call volume?""
Are they really so inept at planning that the call volume is unexpected? For months at a time?
Even non-legacy companies like OpenTable are using it to describe their email load.
Once an institution starts glibly lying, it's a slippery slope. A reality distortion field moves from on-hold time to diesel emissions.
On the other hand, consider what happens if you start by telling the truth about little things. ""To save money for our customers and investors, we keep our support team lightly staffed.

Depth of field,"Focus is a choice.
The runner who is concentrating on how much his left toe hurts will be left in the dust by the runner who is focusing on winning.
Even if the winner's toe hurts just as much.
Hurt, of course, is a matter of perception. Most of what we think about is.
We have a choice about where to aim the lens of our attention. We can relive past injustices, settle old grudges and nurse festering sores. We can imagine failure, build up its potential for destruction, calculate its odds. Or, we can imagine the generous outcomes we're working on, feel gratitude for those that got us here and revel in the possibilities of what's next.
The focus that comes automatically, our instinctual or cultural choice, that focus isn't the only one that's available. Of course it's difficult to change it, which is why so few people manage to do so. But there's no work that pays off better in the long run.

Treating your talk as a gift,"In a few weeks, Chris Anderson's much awaitedbook on TED Talkscomes out. I've just finished reading it, and it's well worth a pre-order. When Chris took the leap 11 years ago and published the first online TED talks, he fundamentally changed the way we consume (and thus give) presentations. Today, it might seem obvious, but sharing these talks online the way he did was a very big leap, and a brilliant idea.
The bullet point, long endangered, was nowdead. Even if you're not planning to give a TED talk any time soon, his book will give you a structure for how we present to groups today. It masterfully weaves and connects lessons from hundreds of talks, including speakers from every walk of life and just about everywhere in the world.
For the last 13 years, TED talks have punctuated my career. It's a privilege and a challenge to be given that platform, and I'm grateful (and a little awed) by the opportunity. The biggest concept in Chris's book is essential: Every talk is a gift.
Here's a quick look back at the five I've given…
My newest (and shortest) TED talk is still in the vaults. I had three minutes on-stage, and discovered that the 45-slide (one every three seconds) bangbang approach that I had practiced was going to be impossible. With two days to go, I called an audible, and spent 48 hours brainstorming and developing a new talk just before I gave it. I turned it into thisblog post.
When you haven't grooved the mental pathways by giving a talk a hundred times, the experience of giving a talk to an esteemed audience is, at least for me, enervating and energizing at precisely the same time. I feel like I'm using my sinews and ligaments, not just my muscles, digging deep to remember what comes next, while simultaneously watching the clock and my audience.
This is a high risk/high reward approach. The best talks work when they open doors and turn on lights for the audience… it's about them, not the speaker's experience. A gift you took the time to create.
My favorite TED talk has never been featured on the TED site. It has no slides, and I gave it exactly one time. This is my version of flying without a net, of being totally present onstage, because it's fresh for me and for the audience. (The first riff is totally improvised, it occurred to me as I walked on stage). The rest of the talk represents more than a few hundred hours of research and practice.
I hope that every teacher and every parent has a chance to argue about this one, that's why I wroteStop Stealing Dreams. The book is free and so is thetalk, below:

Myfunniest TED talkwasn't even given at TED. I did it for Mark Hurst's fantastic GEL conference, and like theStop Stealing Dreamstalk, I have only given it once. It's hard to describe the mix of fear and thrill that happens when they're recording a practiced talk that's brand new to the world… sometimes it doesn't work, but in this case, the audience really came through for me–and yes, the audience matters. I'm not crazy about my haberdashery choices here, but that's what happens when you're busy focusing on something else.

Mymost popular TED talkis the first one I gave, in Monterey, before TED videos were a thing, when the audience was much smaller and I had no idea I'd be on camera (In Chris's book, Barry Schwartz remembers doing his talk in a t-shirt and shorts. Yes, it turns out that revolutionisbeing televised). This is a marketing talk for an audience that actively resisted the idea of marketing, and it was very early in my career as a speaker. I think many of the ideashold upwell here, and I won't make any apologies about it being my first TED…
The best TED attendees are doing work that's worth sharing, that's worth talking about. My mission in this one (and the next) was to talk directly to the people in the room and say, ""look, if it's worth devoting your life to, and it's worth changing the world for, perhaps it's also worth stepping up and saying, 'here, I made this' in a way that spreads.""

And my most polished TED talk almost didn't work. Walking onstage, I discovered that Herbie Hancock's piano was sitting right where I was intending to stand. I'm a bit of a wanderer, but hey, it's Herbie Hancock. Meanwhile, the big clock is ticking, and there's not a lot of free time to consider options. A few minutes into the talk, you'll see that I pull out a light bulb. That bulb was actually a custom made magic trick, a 200 watt bulb that was supposed to light up when I touched it. There was no reason at all for this to happen, it was totally irrelevant to my talk, but I thought it would be fun, so I found a guy to build it for me. Alas, when I touched it, it didn't light up. Live theatre!
One thing I'm proud of is that many of these talks, particularly this one, make people uncomfortable. I'm trying to create tension between what's there and what could be, between what we do and what we could do. Thanks for watching. Even better, thanks for leading.
Time for you to give your talk. The stage doesn't matter, the gift does.

All the events you weren’t there to control…,"Yesterday, thousands of people got married. Just about every one of these weddings went beautifully. Amazingly, you weren't there, on-site, making sure everything was perfect.
Last week, a letter to investors went out from the CFO of a hot public company. It was well received. Yes, it's true, you didn't review it first, but it still worked.
And just the other day, someone was talking about the product you created, but she didn't ask you about it first. That's okay, because the conversation went fine.
When we're in the room, it's really difficult to sit back and let other people do their work, because we know we can make it better, we know the stakes are incredibly high, we know that we care more than anyone else. More often than not, we give in to temptation and wrest away control. And often, we make things better. In the short run.
Caring matters. Your contribution makes things better. But when the need for control starts to get in the way of your people doing their best work, caring about their craft and scaling their efforts, and when the need for control starts to make you crazy, it might be worth thinking about that wedding in Baton Rouge that went just fine without you.","April 2, 2016","control, delegation, trust"

And now they've chosen to go further, and put some of the blog posts you were waiting for in your spam folder, which is the deepest of black holes. No joke.
I hope you'll agree that my blog isn't spam.
Theironyis not lost on me.
If this was just about my blog, it would be a petty rant by a long-time blogger. But of course, the land grab is a persistent erosion. Do we need spam filters? No doubt about it. Selfish marketers keep pushing the envelope.
Google's spam filter is a revelation, it's free and it works, most of the time. The challenge they face, though, is when they start to ratchet up what they filter. The number of things you are counting on getting by email keeps going up, and we need to be able to count on this medium to keep us informed.
There have always been gatekeepers. Martha Stewart decides who gets into the magazine.Steve Casegot to decide who got on the front page of AOL. Apple controls the app marketplace by controlling what gets featured in the app store. This is one way gatekeepers create value–the editorial and focus decisions complement the advertising and increase subscriptions. But it also makes it harder for new voices to be heard.
Modern organizations, like Facebook and Google, have set themselves apart as post-gatekeeper platforms, but of course, they're not, particularly Google. Google profits by putting its own pageshigherthan those of companies that aren't paying to be there. Google benefits when organizations need to buy ads in order to get through to people who might not see their message, even if they have permission.
If you're not paying, you and your attention are the product.
People who create content are spending more and more time figuring out how to alter their messages to get past the filters that are being erected between their readers and their creations. Which is a shame.
Yes, this is a rant. I'm also hoping you'll take a minute to groom your promo and spam filters for all the other stuff that's hidden there. And that you'll subscribe to your favorite blogs by RSS, because it's mostly uninterrupted by people who'd rather you didn't get what you were hoping for. Just you and the blogs you want to get.

A significant defect.
Clearly, they need to recall all of the books they've already printed.
Sandy Williams, head of the division at Houghton Mifflin that publishes the book, was clearly working hard to avoid the cost of a recall. ""It turns out,"" he was quoted as saying, ""that our lexicographers found some significant evidence that cast doubt on whether or not it's even a word. We decided, in an abundance of caution, to leave it out of this edition.""
That's the warning sign… when the rationale/logic/story happensafteryou've decided what you want to do, not before.
This relentless reframing of the truth into something else causes us to not ask the right questions, it prevents us from understanding our options, and from making smart choices. As soon as we say the truth is relative, and shiftable, and a matter of opinion, we lose the power that comes from knowing.
Just because a leader can gain power or influence by denying a truth isn't sufficient reason for you to follow him.
The irony runs deep. People claiming that they care about health have held vaccines back from their kids, re-introducingdangerous diseasesto their childhood.
People insisting that they care about education run to join school boards and thenwork to introduce mythologyto children instead.
The world is not flat. Gullible actuallyisa word. The ice ismelting. The world is not 5,000 years old. Stevie Wonder, is, unfortunately,blind.

The pessimist sees what's present today and can only imagine eventual decline. The glass is already half empty and it's only going to get worse.
The optimist understands that there's a difference between today and tomorrow. The glass is half full, with room for more. The vision is based on possibility, the future tense, not the present one.
Pessimists have trouble making room for possibility, and thus possibility has trouble finding room for pessimists.

Problems,"Avoiding a problem with foresight and good design is a cheap, highly leveraged way to do your work.
Extinguishing a problem before it gets expensive and difficult is almost as good, and far better than paying a premium when there's an emergency.
Fretting about an impending problem, worrying about it, imagining the implications of it… all of this is worthless.
The magic of slack (a little extra time in the chain, a few extra dollars in the bank) is that it gives you the resources to stop and avoid a problem or fix it when it's small.

Beware the gulf of disapproval,"As your new idea spreads, most people who hear about it will dislike it.

Start at the left. Your new idea, your proposal to the company, your new venture, your innovation—no one knows about it.
As you begin to promote it, most of the people (the red line) who hear about it don’t get it. They think it’s a risky scheme, a solution to a problem no one has or that it’s too expensive. Or some combination of the three.
And this is where it would stop, except for the few people on the blue line. These are the early adopters, the believers, and some of them are sneezers. They tell everyone they can about your new idea.
Here’s the dangerous moment. If you’re keeping track of all the people who hate what you’ve done, you’ll give up right here and right now. This is when the gulf of disapproval is at its maximum. This happened to the telephone, to the web, to rap music… lots of people have heard of it, but the number of new fans (the blue line) is far smaller than the number of well-meaning (but in this case, wrong) people on the red line.
Sometimes, if you persist, the value created for the folks on the blue line begins to compound. And so your fans persist and one by one, convert some of the disapproving. Person by person, they shift from being skeptics to accepting the new status quo.

It's easy for a retailer or a freelancer to believe that the best way to succeed is to be cheap. But just about every important brand (and every successful freelancer) didn't get that way by being the cheapest.
And anyone who has been through high school has been reminded how important it is to be well-rounded. But Nobel Prize winners, successful NGO founders and just about everyone you admire didn't get that way by being mediocre at a lot of things.

Transitions,"Coming and going matter far more than what happens in the middle.
Opening things.
Closing them.
Tearing off the bandage.
Losing something.
Meeting someone new.
Getting on the airplane, getting off of it.
Being greeted.
Elections.
Ending a feud.
We mistakenly spend most of our time thinking about, working on and measuring the in-between parts, imagining that this is the meat of it, the important work. In fact, humans remember the transitions, because it's moments of change and possibility and trepidation that light us up.","May 25, 2016","Transitions, Change, Memory"
There is more than one solution to your problem (and your problem is real),"Challenge one:Believing that the solution you've got (the person you want to hire, the strategy you want to implement, the decision you want to make) is the one and only way to make the problem go away or take advantage of the opportunity.
Falling in love with your solution makes it incredibly difficult to see its flaws, to negotiate with people who don't agree with you, to find an even better solution.
And, on the other side of the table…
Challenge two:When you find someone who is pitching a solution you don't like, it's tempting to deny that there's much of a problem at all. After all, if you diminish the problem, you won't have to accept the solution that's on the table.
But of course, the problem is real. The dissatisfaction or inefficiency or wrong direction isn't going to go away merely because we deny it.

Breakpoints,"A neighbor recently put in some new sidewalk. As usual, the workman interrupted the unbroken swath of perfect concrete with lines every three feet.
What are the lines for?
Well, the ground shifts. When it does, perfect concrete cracks in unpredictable ways, often ruining the entire job. When you put the breakpoints in on purpose, though, the concrete has a chance to absorb the shifts, to degrade effectively.
This is something we often miss in design and in the creation of customer experiences. We're so optimistic we forget to put in the breakpoints.
There's no doubt the ground will shift. The question is: when it does, will you be ready?","May 23, 2016","breakpoints, design, customer experiences"
More than ten is too many,"Human beings suffer fromscope insensitivity.
Time and again, we're unable to put more urgency or more value on choices that have more impact. We don't donate ten times as much to a charity that's serving 10 times (or even 100 times) more people. We don't prioritize our interest or our urgency based on scale, we do it based on noise.
And yet, too often, we resort to a narrative about big numbers.
It doesn't matter that there are more than 6,000 posts on this blog. It could be 600 or 60. It won't change what you read next.
It doesn't matter if a library has a million books instead of a hundred thousand.
It doesn't matter how many people live without electricity.
Of course it matters. What I meant to say is that when you're about to make a decision of scale, right here and right now, if the number is more than ten, the scope of the opportunity or problem will almost certainly be underestimated.","May 22, 2016","scope insensitivity, decision-making, scale"
Metaphors aren’t true,"But they're useful.
That's why professionals use them to teach, to learn and to understand.
A metaphor takes what we know and uses it as a lever to understand something else. And the only way we can do that is by starting with the true thing and then twisting it into a new thing, a thing we'll be able to also understand.
(Of course, a metaphor isn'tactuallya lever, a physical plank of wood that has a fulcrum, which is precisely my point).
The difference between the successful professional and the struggling amateur can often be seen in their respective facility with metaphor. The amateur struggles to accept that metaphor is even acceptable (""are atomsactuallybuilding blocks?"") or can't find the powerful analogy needed to bring home the concept. Because all metaphors aren't actually true, it takes confidence to use them well.
If you're having trouble understanding a disconnect, or are seeking to explain why something works or doesn't, begin with a metaphor. ""Why is this new thing a lot like that understood thing…""
Metaphors aren't true, but they work.

The other kind of harm,"Pop culture is enamored with the Bond villian, the psycho, the truly evil character intent on destruction.
It lets us off the hook, because it makes it easy to see that bad guys are other people.
But most of the stuff that goes wrong, much of the organizational breakdown, the unfixed problems and the help not given, ends up happening because the system lets it happen. It happens because a boss isn't focusing, or priorities are confused, or people in a meeting somewhere couldn't find the guts to challenge the status quo.

Our bias for paid marketing,"A few rhetorical questions:
Is a physical therapist with a professional logo better than one with a handmade sign?
Are you more likely to stay at a hotel that you've heard of as opposed to an unknown one, even if 'heard of' refers to the fact that they've run ads?
Do you believe that companies that rank higher in search results are better than the ones a few pages later? And if you don't, then what's the reason we so often stop clicking after one page?
There are more ways than ever to spread the word about your work, but we live in a culture where paid ads still have clout.
""As Seen on TV"" was such a powerful phrase that companiesbragabout it, right on the box. And that connection between paying for attention and quality still remains.
Over time, we've been sufficiently seduced by marketers that spend on the surface stuff that cognitive dissonance has persuaded us that we must be making those choices for a reason.
Find the discipline to build your projects like you won't be able to run ads to make them succeed. A product that sells itself, that's remarkable, that spreads.
Then consider running ads as if you don't need them.","May 19, 2016","Paid marketing, brand perception, advertising effectiveness"
The short run and the long run,"It’s about scale. Pick a long enough one (or a short enough one) and you can see the edges.
In the short run, there’s never enough time.
In the long run, constrained resources become available.
In the short run, you can fool anyone.
In the long run, trust wins.
In the short run, we’ve got a vacancy, hire the next person you find.
In the long run, we spend most of our time with the people we’ve chosen in the short run.
In the short run, decisions feel more urgent and less important at the same time.
In the long run, most decisions are obvious and easy to make.
In the short run, it’s better to panic and obsess on emergencies and urgencies.
In the long run, spending time with people you love, doing work that matters, is all that counts.
In the short run, trade it all for attention.
In the long run, it’s good to own it (the means of production, the copyrights, the process).
In the short run, burn it down, someone else will clean up the problem.
In the long run, the environment in which we live is what we need to live.
In the short run, better to cut class.
In the long run, education pays off.
In the short run, tearing people down is a great way to get ahead.
In the long run, building things of value makes sense.
Add up the short runs, though, and you’re left with the long run. It’s going to be the long run a lot longer than the short run will last.

Identity vs. logic,"Before we start laying out the logical argument for a course of action, it's worth considering whether a logical argument is what's needed.
It may be that the person you're engaging with cares more about symbols, about tribal identity, about the status quo. They may be driven by fear or anger or jealousy. It might be that they just don't care that much.
Sometimes we find ourselves in a discussion where the most coherent, actionable, rational argument wins.
Sometimes, but not often.
People like us do things like this.","May 17, 2016","Identity, Logic, Engagement"
Using video well,"The web was built on words.
And words, of course, are available to anyone who can type. They're cheap, easy to edit and incredibly powerful when used well.
Today's internet, though, is built on video. Much more difficult to create well, far more impactful when it works.
My friends atGraydin, for example, needed only 140 seconds to make their case about their practice.
Because video costs more, is more difficult to edit and takes a different sort of talent to create, we often avoid it. Or worse, we cut corners and fail to do ourselves justice by posting something mediocre.
When copy exploded across the web, the professional copywriter felt threatened. Anyone could write, and anyone did.
When photography was added to the mix, the professional photographer felt threatened. Everyone had a camera, after all.
And now, the same thing is happening to video.
In each case, the professional has something to add, something significant, but she has to change her posture from scarce bottleneck to extraordinary contributor.
Great video doesn't change the rules. A great video on your site isn't enough. You still need permission, still need to seek remarkability, still need to create something that matters. What video represents is the chance—if you invest in it—to tell your story in a way that sticks.","May 16, 2016","Video, storytelling, professionalism"
"Actually, more data might not be what you’re hoping for","They got us hooked on data. Advertisers want more data. Direct marketers want more data. Who saw it? Who clicked? What percentage? What's trending? What's yielding?
But there's one group that doesn't need more data…
Anyone who's making a long-term commitment. Anyone who seeks to make art, to make a difference, to challenge the status quo.
Because when you're chasing that sort of change, data is the cudgel your enemies will use to push you to conform.
Data paves the road to the bottom. It is the lazy way to figure out what to do next. It's obsessed with the short-term.

Amplifying social proof,"Trust is the biggest hurdle.
And trust largely comes from social proof.
Is everyone doing this?
Is it safe?
Will I be embarrassed/ridiculed/left out/left behind/feel stupid?
Social proof shares a word with social networks, but they're only loosely related.
Social proof is the story we end up believing.
Your job as a marketer, then, is to take the threads of social proof and weave them together into something powerful.
No, you can't fake this (and shouldn't try). But you can amplify it. You can focus the proof on a tiny cohort, so that it has more impact. You can invest in media that acts as a megaphone, multiplying the impact of the proof you already have.
One way to be trusted is to trust the people you seek to serve.
Mostly, you can work to build something that's worth trusting.","May 14, 2016","social proof, trust, marketing"
The momentum myth,"Roller coasters work because of momentum—the quantity of motion from the downhill allows the car to make it up the next rise. Without momentum, the car would merely stop. But few things in the world of ideas follow the same rules.
Ideas have no mass, they don't coast.
Authors fall into this trap over and over again. They believe that a big launch, the huge push upfront, the bending of the media in their favor (at any cost) is the way to ensure that weeks two and three and eleven will continue to show solid growth.
A decade ago, I wrotetwodifferentpostsfor friends who were launching books. The ideas still stand.
I'm betting that an analysis of the Billboard charts over the last fifty years would confirm that the speed a song makes it to the top has no correlation with how long it stays at the top.
Here's alookat the cumulative sales forYour Turn, the book I published in November 2014. And you'd find a similar curve for most successful books.
The launch is the launch. What happens after the launch, though, isn't the result of momentum. It's the result of a different kind of showing up, of word of mouth, of the book (or whatever tool you're using to cause change) being part of something else, something bigger.

The toddler strategy,"Most people don't get too upset at anything a two-year-old kid says to them.
That's because we don't believe that toddlers have a particularly good grasp on the nuances of the world, nor do they possess much in the way of empathy. Mostly, though, it turns out that getting mad at a toddler doesn't do any good, because he's not going to change as a result (not for a few years, anyway).
Couldn't the same be said for your uninformed critics? For the people who bring you down without knowing any better, for those that sabotage your best work, or undermine your confidence for selfish reasons?
It's hardly productive to ruin your day and your work trying to teach these folks a lesson.

Striking a chord,"Commonly misunderstood and misspelled as ""striking a cord.""
A cord is a single strand that connects. You can strike a cord, but not much happens.

On being treated like an adult,"It's great to dream like a kid, but no fun to be treated like one. It bristles because we feel that, even if the person involved has best intentions, we've outgrown being treated like a child. Some behaviors to consider if you want to avoid this situation…
Make long-term plans instead of whining
Ask hard questions but accept truthful answers
Don't insist that there's a monster under the bed even after you've seen there isn't
Manage your debt wisely
Go to school, early and often
Don't call people names
Get your own drink of water
Don't hit your siblings
Stop bullying
No tantrums

Rigor,"Doing things with rigor takes effort, but not everything you put effort into is done with rigor.
Rigor is a focus on process. Paying attention to not just how you do things, but why. Rigor requires us to never use an emergency as an excuse. It is a process for the long haul, the work of a professional.
An amateur bread baker leaves the kitchen coated in flour, and sometimes, perhaps, ends up with a great loaf of bread.
A professional baker might not seem to be as flustered, as hassled or even as busy. But the bread, the result of this mindful process, is worth buying, every day.

But that doesn't explain Marianne Money, bank manager, or Jim Kardwell, who owns a card company. Or Thomas Duck who started Ugly Duckling rent-a-car and Tito Beveridge who makes vodka. It doesn't explain why people named Dennis are more likely to become dentists…
I'm not sure thatanyonehas a calling. I think, instead, our culture creates situations where passionate people find a place where they can make an impact. When what you do is something that you make important, it doesn't matter so much what you do.

Unlimited bowling,"When we were kids, my mom, fully exasperated, would survive a day when school was closed by dropping a bunch of us off at Sheridan Lanes for a few hours of bowling.
You only had a certain amount of money to spend, and each game (and the snacks) cost, so we knew that one could only play a few games. Which meant that every single roll mattered. Don't waste one.
Unlimited bowling is a whole different concept. As many games as you want. Roll to your heart's content.
When you're doing unlimited bowling, you can practice various shots. You can work on the risky splits. You can bowl without remorse.
As you've guessed, the fat pipes of the internet bring the idea of unlimited bowling to much of what we do. Interesting is enough. Generous is enough. Learning is enough.
It's a special kind of freedom, we shouldn't waste it.

The most common b2b objection (and the one we have about most innovations),"You'll never hear it spoken aloud, but it happens all the time, particularly when you're selling something new, something powerful, something that causes a positive change:
""You're right, but we're not ready.""
This is what people felt about the internet, about word processors, about yoga pants…
When you think this is going on, the answer isn't to be more 'right'. The answer is to figure out how to help people be more 'ready'.

“What do I owe you?”,"One of the little-remembered innovations of the industrial economy was the price tag.
If it was for sale, you knew how much it cost.
And if you got a job, you knew what you got paid–by the piece, at first, and then by the hour and perhaps by the week.
Both price tags and pre-agreed wages are pretty new ideas, ideas that fundamentally changed our culture.
By putting a price on buying and selling of goods and effort, industrialists permitted commerce to flow. One of the side effects, as Lewis Hyde has pointed out, is that knowing the price depersonalizes the transaction. It's even steven, we're done, goodbye.
Compare this to the craftsperson who won't sell to someone she doesn't respect, or the cook who charges people based on what he thinks someone can afford, or based on what he'll need to keep this project going a little longer… These ad hoc transactions are personal, they bring us closer together. Everything doesn't have to have a price if we don't let it.
Which leads to the eagerly avoided questions like, ""What do you owe the editors at Wikipedia?"" or ""Is it okay to blog if you don't get paid for it?"" and ""Is there a difference between staying at a friend of a friend's house and staying at an Airbnb?"" When people use Kickstarter as a sort of store, they denature the entire point of the exercise.
Seeking out personal transactions might be merely a clever way to save money. But in a post-industrial economy, it's also a way to pay it forward and to build community.
Sometimes, we don't pay because we have to, we pay because we can.

This joins the course we did withElizabeth Gilbert(see below for reviews).
Which followed the first, theleadership courseI launched the series with.
It's amazing what you can learn in a few hours if you're willing to do the work.

Elizabeth is awesome on camera. I feel like it's just the two of us. Normally, I hate online courses. This is different! Loving this! – Denise
Who doesn't love Liz Gilbert? The content was refreshing and inspirational. The assignments were thought-provoking. For the price I paid, I thought this was a great workshop. – Bernadette Xiong
This is amazing. I have needed this kind of talking to for a very long time. Thank you, Elizabeth. – James Hoag
I love it! Her voice is soothing and what she is saying is so appealing. I can't wait to go on! – Susan Archibald
I enjoyed it very much. Many good nuggets of wisdom to help me on my path. – Linda Joyner
Elizabeth has that rare ability to invite you into an intimate conversation on a very weighty subject, with a touch as light as a sparrow's ripple of air on a spring day. The introduction has already laid out some actions to take that I can tell will wake up my sense of being alive and in the world. – Jim Caroompas
Being at the age where you start questioning everything around you, I feel so far that this workshop is directed to me. I feel as thought Liz has invited me over to discuss a few things to help me get back on track. – Maria Pezzano
Liz's response to the fatigued teacher really resonated with me. The fact that the reason and season for our existence and the various roles we play change with time. I love the takeaways – going from grandiose to granular, learning with humility and serving with joy. These are lessons for life. – Smita Kumar
This course was just what I needed, delivered by a wise, empathetic, funny, fun Elizabeth Gilbert. It didn't chew up vast amounts of time or make me feel like I had ""work"" to do. I enjoyed it so much I'll probably go back and do the entire thing over again. Don't feel like you need to do all the workbooks right away, either. I percolated them for a while and it still worked out fine. More Elizabeth Gilbert, please! – Vanessa Kelly","May 4, 2016","Price, Transaction, Community"
Learning from the rejection,"When someone doesn't say yes, they'll often give you a reason.
A common trap: Believe the reason.
If you start rebuilding your product, your pitch and your PR based on the stated reason, you're driving by looking in the rear view mirror.
The people who turn you down have a reason, but they're almost certainly not telling you why.
Fake reasons: I don't like the color, it's too expensive, you don't have enough references, there was a typo in your resume.
Real reasons: My boss won't let me, I don't trust you, I'm afraid of change.
By all means, make your stuff better. More important, focus on the unstated reasons that drive most rejections. And most important: Shun the non-believers and sell to people who want to go on a journey with you.","May 3, 2016","rejection, feedback, improvement"
Duck!,"Perhaps you can't see it, but we can. That 2 x 4, the board set right across that doorway, about 5 feet off the ground.
You're running it at it full speed, and in a moment, you're going to slam into it, which is going to hurt, a lot.
This happens to most of us, metaphorically anyway, at one time or another. But when it happens repeatedly, you probably have a hygiene problem.
Emotional hygiene, personal hygiene, moral hygiene, organizational hygiene–useful terms for the act of deliberately making hard decisions, early and often, to prevent a 2 x 4 to the face later.
Worth a pause to highlight that: hygiene never pays off in the short run. It is always the work of a mature person (or  an organization) who cares enough about the later to do something important in the now.
When the doctor scrubs with soap before a procedure, it's not because it's fun. It's because she's investing a few minutes now to prevent sepsis later.

How to use a microphone,"More than 10,000 people attended the Lincoln Douglas debates, and yet they debated without amplification.
It's only quite recently that we began to disassociate talking-to-many from talking loudly. Having a large and varied audience used to mean yelling, it used to be physically taxing, it would put our entire body on alert.
Now, of course, all of us have a microphone.
The instinct remains, though. When we know that hundreds or thousands of people will read our words online, we tense up. When we get on stage, we follow that pattern and tense our vocal cords.
We shout.
The problem with shouting is that it pushes people away. WHEN YOU SHOUT IN EMAIL, IT SEEMS ANGRY. Shouting creates a wall between us and the person at the other end (even though it seems like many people, sooner or later, there's one person at the other end).
Shouting destroys intimacy, and it hurts our impact, the impact that comes from authenticity.
We feel speech and words long before we hear the words, and we hear the words long before we understand them.
The solution is simple: whisper.
Practice whispering.
Whisper when you type, whisper when you address a meeting.
Lower your voice, slow your pace, and talk more quietly.
The microphone will amplify your words. And we'll hear them.","May 1, 2016","microphone, communication, whisper"
Chump (Don’t get played),"How did Bernie Madoff do it? How did he steal twenty billion dollars from people who should have known better? It doesn't matter if you went to university or not–you can still be played as a chump.
To pull off a significant deception, you generally need two things: A deceiver and a crowd of people open to being deceived.
Once those are present, the deceiver brings out the big lie.
For lots of reasons, people are open to looking for shortcuts and a new reality, even if no shortcuts are available. They may have been mistreated, might be struggling, or they may merely be greedy, looking to outdo the other guy. In the case of Madoff, he was even able to take in charities, with boards that meant well but were in a hurry to scale.
Frustration in the face of the way things are makes us open to the big lie. Frustration and fear and anger can suspend our ability to ask difficult questions, to listen to thoughtful critics, to do our homework.
And the big lie is always present when we get played. To be a chump (not merely the victim) is to be open to the big lie. Not merely open to it, eager to buy into it.
Numbers make it easy to tell a big lie. People hate numbers, and they seem so real.
Anti-intellectualism, disregard for the scientific method and conspiracy theories also set the stage for a big lie.
And demonizing the other, the one who is already held in low esteem or feared by the chump, this is usually part of the big lie as well.
In retrospect, the warning signs around Madoff were obvious. Just about any skeptical, thoughtful investor could have seen through the big lie if he wasn't so busy being a chump.
When a population gets played, the responsibility lies with the liar, with the con man, with the person so craven that they'll trade trust and productivity and a bit of civilization for some power and authority.
But the chump also has to take responsibility. Responsibility for looking for the shortcut, giving into the fear and for eagerly believing the big lie, ignoring the clues that are all around.
Chumps aren't restricted by nationality, by education, by income. Chump is an attitude and a choice.
We're not chumps. Not if we don't choose to be.","June 30, 2016","deception, responsibility, vulnerability"
A dollar more (vs. a dollar less),"Consider a race to the top.
How can Lyft possibly compete with Uber? Scale is often the secret to a commodity business, and if Lyft races to be ever cheaper than Uber, the only possible outcome doesn’t look good. It’s a cutthroat corner-cutting race.
But what happens if Lyft (or your project) decides to race to the top instead?
What if they say, “we’re always a dollar more than Uber”?
And then they spend that dollar, all of it, on the drivers…
What kind of person buys the cheap ride, the ride with the stressed-out angry drivers?
So instead of drivers abandoning fares they accept (they’re under so much pressure to make ends meet, Uber drivers do this all the time–it happened to me four times in one weekend), you end up with drivers that were good enough to be able to charge an extra dollar…
Uber becomes the bottom fisher, and Lyft (or whatever it is you do) is the place you go once you’ve proven yourself…
And what would happen if your fast food place said, “we’re the place that charges you a dollar extra at lunch,” and they spent all that dollar in paying their employees and their suppliers a living wage?
Some people will always want the cheapest, regardless of what it actually ends up costing them. But in market after market, the list goes on. Projects and organizations that proudly charge a dollar more.
Not merely a dollar more.

The benefit of the doubt,"Doubt is corrosive.
Someone faced with doubt rarely brings her best self to the table. Doubt undermines confidence, it casts aspersions, it assumes untruths.
Yes, of course you need to qualify your leads. And yes, we know that you need to protect against risk and to not waste your time.
But… if you're going to spend five minutes or five hours with someone, what happens if you begin with, ""the benefit of confidence"" instead? What if you begin by believing, by seeking to understand, by rooting for the other person to share their best stories, their vision and their hopes?
Perhaps you can manipulate someone by scowling, by negging, by putting on airs. But if you do that, you end up with people who have been manipulated, who are wounded and not ready to soar.
The problem with qualifying leads is that all the obvious ones are already taken.
The challenge with assuming that someone is completely imperfect is that you'll almost certainly be right.

Uninformed dissent,"“I’m not sure what it is, but I’m against it.”
It’s a mistake to believe that people know all the facts before they decide.
In fact, most of the time, we decide and then figure out if we need to get some facts to justify our instinct.
There are two common causes of uninformed dissent:
The first is a person who fears change, or is quite happy with the status quo. He doesn’t have to read your report or do the math or listen to the experts, because the question is, “change” and his answer is, “no.”
The second (quite common in a political situation), is the tribal imperative that people like us do things like this. No need to do the science, or understand the consequences or ask hard questions. Instead, focus on the emotional/cultural elements and think about the facts later .","June 26, 2016","uninformed dissent, change resistance, tribal imperative"
Not enough ‘if’ or not enough ‘then’?,"All change involves an if/then promise.

The problem with complaining about the system,"…is that the system can’t hear you. Only people can.
And the problem is that people in the system are too often swayed to believe that they have no power over the system, that they are merely victims of it, pawns, cogs in a machine bigger than themselves.
Alas, when the system can’t hear you, and those who can believe they have no power, nothing improves.
Systems don’t mistreat us, misrepresent us, waste our resources, govern poorly, support an unfair status quo and generally screw things up–people do.
If we care enough, we can make it change.","June 24, 2016","complaining, system, empowerment"
Taking notes vs. taking belief,"Is there anything easier than listening to a lecture or reading a book and taking notes?
And is there anything more difficult than setting aside our preconceptions and the resistance and acting 'as if', being open to belief, at least for a moment?
If taking notes is making it easier for you to postpone (or avoid) the possibility of belief, better to put down the pencil and focus.
Facts are easy to come by. Finding a new way to think and a new confidence in our choices is difficult indeed.","June 23, 2016","notes, belief, mindset"
Bigger for?,"Is bigger better for the investor or is it better for the customer?
At a huge hotel in Nashville (more than 1,000 rooms), there's always a long line at the check in desk, the gym is full at 5 in the morning and the staff has no clue who any guest is.
It's clear that doubling the size of the hotel helped the owner make more money (for now). But it's worth taking a moment to think about whether bigger is the point.
Maybe better is?","June 22, 2016","investor, customer, better"
"“So busy doing my job, I can’t get any work done”","Your job is an historical artifact. It's a list of tasks, procedures, alliances, responsibilities, to-dos, meetings (mostly meetings) that were layered in, one at a time, day after day, for years.
And your job is a great place to hide.
Because, after all, if you're doing your job, how can you fail? Get in trouble? Make a giant error?
The work, on the other hand, is the thing you do that creates value. This value you create, the thing you do like no one else can do, is the real reason we need you to be here, with us.
When you discover that the job is in the way of the work, consider changing your job enough that you can go back to creating value.

You can’t ask customers what they want,"… not if your goal is to find a breakthrough. Because your customers have trouble imagining a breakthrough.
You ought to know what their problems are, what they believe, what stories they tell themselves. But it rarely pays to ask your customers to do your design work for you.
So, if you can't ask, you can assert. You can look for clues, you can treat different people differently, and you can make a leap. You can say, ""assuming you're the kind of person I made this for, here's what I made.""
The risk here is that many times, you'll be wrong.
But if you're not okay with that, you're never going to create a breakthrough.","June 20, 2016","customer insight, breakthrough innovation, design thinking"
The saying/doing gap,"At first, it seems as though the things you declare, espouse and promise matter a lot. And they do. For a while.
But in the end, we will judge you on what you do. When the gap between what you say and what you do gets big enough, people stop listening.
The compromises we make, the clients we take on, the things we do when we think no one is watching… this is how people measure us.
It seems as though the amount of time it takes for the gap to catch up with marketers/leaders/humans is getting shorter and shorter.","June 19, 2016","saying/doing gap, authenticity, accountability"
“The way we do things”,"There are two pitfalls you can encounter in dealing with focus and process:
In 1994, I ignored the web, defining our business as being email pioneers, not, more broadly, pioneering digital interactions. It took three years to catch up from that error.
On the other hand, we raced to do business with online services from Apple and Microsoft. Not because they were in our focus, but because we could.
The easiest way to see these errors is in hindsight, which does you no good at all.
The best way to avoid these two errors is to regularly decide (in a moment of quiet, not panic) what you do and where you do it. With intention.","June 18, 2016","focus, process, decision-making"
Stretching without support,"One of the fundamental equations of our self-narrative is:If I only had more support, I could accomplish even more.
Part of this is true. With more education, a stronger foundation, better cultural expectations, each of us is likely to contribute even more, to level up, to make a difference.
The part that's not true: ""If only.""
It turns out that every day, some people shatter our expectations. They build more than they have any right to, show up despite a lack of lucky breaks or a cheering section. Every day, some people stretch further.
You might not be able to do much about the support, but you can definitely do something about the stretching. It's under your control, not someone else's.
And practicing helps.

The ruby slippers problem,"Most of what we're chasing is that which we've had all along.

It’s not a race,"Some things are races, but not many.
A race is a competition in which the point is to win. You're not supposed to enjoy the ride, learn anything or make your community better. You're supposed to win.
At the end of a race, people congratulate the winner, and point out how well she did by winning. The rest of the field, the losers, well, hey, you tried.
Once you see it that clearly, so many things are clearly not races. And when we treat life that way, we cheat our customers, the people we seek to serve, as well as ourselves.
We sometimes abbreviate, ""he won a particular race,"" to, ""he's a winner."" They're not the same thing.

""There's nothing to do around here."" ""I'm bored."" ""Nothing's happening in this place.""
You could whine about the fact that your college didn't have enough activities, or that the bar was 'dead'.
Today, though, the obligation is on us to make our own magic. To find two sticks and turn them into a game. To organize our own conversations, find our own connections… most of all, to bring generosity and energy to communities that don't have enough of either one.
Freedom and leverage is great, but it comes with responsibility. We're all curators/concierges/impresarios now.

Raising the average,"Great organizations are filled with people who are eagerly seeking to recruit people better than they are. Not just employees, but vendors, coaches and even competitors.
Most organizations seek to hire, ""people like us."" The rationale is that someone too good might not take the job, might get frustrated, might be easily lured away.
A few aim for, ""so good she scares me."" A few aim for, ""it'll raise our game.""
This takes guts.
It takes guts for an employee or a group member to aggressively try to persuade people more passionate, more skilled or smarter to join in, because by raising the average, they also expose themselves to the fact that they're not as good as they used to be (relatively).
Can we take it a little further? What happens if we read a book we not quite sure we'll understand, or ski down a slope that's a little too hard or sign up for a project we're not certain we can easily do?
What happens if we go to a school where we think everyone is smarter than we are?

Do not seek reassurance from them.
Do not become vulnerable about your tiny new sprout of an inkling.
It will be extinguished by people who mean well. They are trying to protect you from heartache.
There is a very, very tiny group of fellow travelers who can amplify your inkling. For the rest, keep it quiet. Trot out a make-believe idea instead, a pretend Potemkin Village of a project, let them dump all over that one instead.

“But where’s the money?”,"A colleague was talking to the CEO of a fast-growing small business about a partnership opportunity.
The CEO said, ""well, this is something we believe in, something we want to have happen,"" and then he continued, ""in fact, it's something my partners and I want to be able to support in our personal and our corporate lives.""
But he declined, because, times are tough, the company is small, they need all their resources, etc.
If you aren't willing to live your values now, when will you start?
A company that begins with its priorities straight–about how it will keep promises, treat its workers, support causes it believes in–will rarely have trouble becoming the kind of company that does this at scale.
But if you put it in a folder marked ""later,"" it may never happen.

Your job vs. your project,"Jobs are finite, specified and something we ‘get’. Doing a job makes us defensive, it limits our thinking. The goal is to do just enough, not get in trouble, meet spec. When in doubt, seek deniability.
Projects are open-ended, chosen and ours. Working on a project opens the door to possibility. Projects are about better, about new frontiers, about making change happen. When in doubt, dare.
Jobs demand meetings and the key word is ‘later’. Projects encourage ‘now.’
You can get paid for a job (or a project). Or not. The pay isn’t the point, the approach is.
Some people don’t have a project, only a job. That’s a choice, and it’s a shame. Some people work to turn their project into a job, getting them the worst of both. If all you’ve ever had is jobs (a habit that’s encouraged starting in first grade), it’s difficult to see just how easy it is to transform your work into a project.

“Um” and “like” and being heard,"You can fix your ""um"" and you probably should.
Each of us now owns a media channel and a brand, and sooner or later, as your work gains traction, we'll hear your voice. Either in a job interview or on a podcast or in a video.
For a million years, people have been judging each other based on voice. Not just on what we say, but on how we say it.
I heard a Pulitzer-prize winning author interviewed on a local radio show. The tension of the interview caused an ""um"" eruption—your words and your approach sell your ideas, and at least on this interview, nothing much got sold.
Or consider the recent college grad who uses thirty or forty ""likes"" a minute. Hard to see through to the real you when it's so hard to hear you.
Alas, you can't remove this verbal tic merely by willing it away.
Here's what youcando: Persuade yourself that the person you're talking to will give you the floor, that he won't jump in the moment you hesitate. You actually don't have to keep making sounds in order to keep your turn as the speaker. The fastest speaker is not the speaker who is heard best or even most.
Next step: First on your own, eventually practicing with friends, replace the ""um"" with nothing. With silence.
Talk as slowly as you need to. Every time you want to insert a podium-holding stall-for-time word, say nothing instead. Merely pause.
You can do this into a tape recorder, you can try it in a meeting. It works.
You're not teaching yourself to get rid of ""um."" You're replacing the um with silence. You're going slow enough that this isn't an issue.
Then you can slowly speed up.

On knowing it can be done,"Can you imagine how difficult the crossword puzzle would be if any given answer might be, ""there is no such word""?
The reason puzzles work at all is that we know we should keep working on them until we figure them out. Giving up is not a valid strategy, because none-of-the-above is not a valid answer.
The same thing happened with the 4 minute mile. It was impossible, until it was done. Once Bannister ran his mile, the floodgates opened.
Knowing it was possible was the hard part.
And that's how software leaps forward as well. Almost no one seriously attempts something, until someone figures out that with a lot of work, it can be done. Then the shortcuts begin to appear, and suddenly, it's easy.
What's possible?

All mirrors are broken,"It's impossible to see yourself as others do.
Not merely because the medium is imperfect, but, when it comes to ourselves, we process what we see differently than everyone else in the world does.
We make this mistake with physical mirrors as well as the now ubiquitous mirror of what people are saying about us behind our back on social media. We misunderstand how we look on that video or how we come across in that note.
When we see a group photo, we instantly look at ourselves first. When we pass a mirror on the wall, we check to see if there's parsley stuck on our teeth, yet fail to notice how horrible that camel's hair jacket we love actually looks on us. When someone posts a review of something we've built, or responds/reacts to something we've written online, we dissect it, looking for the germ of truth that will finally help us see ourselves as others do.
No one understands your self-narrative, no one cares that much about you, no one truly gets what it's like to be you. That germ of truth you're seeking isn't there, no matter how hard you look in the mirror.

Good blogs aren't focused on the vapid race for clicks that other forms of social media encourage. Instead, they patiently inform and challenge, using your time with respect.
Here's the thing: Google doesn't want you to read blogs. They shut down their RSS reader and they're dumping many blog subscriptions into the gmail promo folder, where they languish unread.
And Facebook doesn't want you to read blogs either. They have cut back the organic sharing some blogs benefitted from so that those bloggers will pay to 'boost' their traffic to what it used to be.

“So simple it doesn’t need instructions”,"Eager (and less-talented) designers often get confused about this instruction, turning it into: ""It doesn't have instructions, therefore it's simple.
Consider a hotelshower. It has 11 things that might be dials, and five that actually are. The alert person, standing under cold water, at 5 in the morning, in a dark hotel room, will probably (???) realize that the bottom dial, all the way near the floor, is actually the one that controls the temperature.
The lack of instructions doesn't make something simple.
I used to write the manuals for the educational software we shipped in the mid 1980s. The goal was clear: write exactly enough that no one would call us on the phone.
Today, of course, instructions are really cheap to provide. On a shower, all you need is a simple label. But just about anything else you produce ought to come with digital instructions, written or on video.
Don't make us read your mind.
[Yes, it's true, almost no one reads the instructions… people are so self-absorbed and hurried that they plunge first. One more reason to build something simple. But at least you can post instructions so that after they fail the first time, they have a shot at getting it right the second time.]

Can you invent a thing for which no one will ever invent a better version of it?
Certainly, Dylan has done that for dozens of his songs.
And Frank Lloyd Wright did it with 'Falling Water'. No one will ever build a better version of it.

Singular is the one that we can tell apart, the one we remember, the one we will miss when it's gone.
It's entirely possible that creators with scale are also singular (like Van, or Miranda), but it's not required. Many of the artists, leaders and teachers that have had an impact on you and on me have done so with very little popular acclaim.

The flip is elusive,"For a generation after people realized that smoking would kill them, many smart, informed people still smoked. Then, many of them stopped.
After discovering that an expensive luxury good is made out of the same materials as a cheaper alternative, many people stick with the expensive one. And then they gradually stop going out of their way to pay more.
After a technology breakthrough makes it clear that a new approach is faster, cheaper and more reliable, many people stick with the old way. Until they don't.
And inevitably, it doesn't matter how much people discover about their favorite candidate, they seem impervious to revelations, facts and the opinions of others. For a while, sometimes a very long while. But then, they assert that all along they knew something was amiss and find a new person to align with.

Effort,"What does it mean to 'try your best'?
Or to put more effort into something than other organizations do?

Good decisions (and sunk costs),"An anonymous friend sends you two tickets to Hamilton, showing on Broadway tomorrow night.

"The computer, the network and the economy","Where did all the good jobs go?
They didn’t head to other countries or even down the street.
The good jobs I’m talking about are the ones that our parents were used to. Steady, consistent factory work. The sort of middle class job you could build a life around. Jobs where you do what you’re told, an honest day’s work, and get rewarded for it.
Those jobs. Where did they go?
The computer ate them.
For a hundred years, industrialists have had a clearly stated goal: standardized workers building standardized parts.
The assembly line was king, and the cruel logic of commodity economics pushed industrialists to improve productivity. They did this by improving the assembly line and, when they could, by paying workers less.
We invented public school to give the industrialists enough compliant workers. More supply meant that they could pay people less. More supply meant that the terms of the deal were in their hands.
But as the economy grew, the demand for workers for these jobs grew as well. It fueled a housing boom, a retail boom, a mass marketing boom.
The computer (and the network it enabled) turbocharged this race toward cheaper and faster.
The computer patiently measures and reports.
And the network creates value in connection.
The connection economy values the bridges between the nodes as much as the nodes themselves. Uber is worth more than the independent cars it connects.
So, the computer:
First, if you (the owner of the means of production, the boss, the industrialist) can find a supplier who can make a part for less, you will, and you did.
Second, once you can parcel work among your employees, you can measure them ever more closely and figure out how to maximize what you get (and minimize what you pay).
Third, computers make patient, consistent, cheap workers. When you can train a CNC machine or a spreadsheet to do a job better than a person can, odds are you will.
It’s difficult to overstate how powerful this three-part shift is.
125 years ago, the Singer sewing machine was one of the most complicated consumer products ever constructed. Every part in every machine was hand fitted to work. Replacement parts had to be hand tweaked to fit. Without craftsmen, there was no chance such a machine would exist.
Today, it’s possible to build just about anything merely by specifying existing parts, sending them to an assembly shop and accepting delivery. If any provider along the supply chain wants to charge extra for their commodity contribution, the creator can switch suppliers.
Today, the typical worker serves the computer. Only a few have computers that work for them.
Sure, there are still pockets of work that are essentially unmeasured or unique enough that they’re difficult to replace. This is where the remaining ‘good jobs’ exist.
For the rest, though, the first brick in the wall is clear:Either you serve the computer or it serves you.Either you are working on spec to create a commodity, or you are using new tools to create disruptions and to establish yourself as thelinchpin, the one we can’t easily live without.
It happened to machine tool operators and to radiologists as well. It happened to travel agents, to lawyers, to the local shopkeeper as well.
And the network? What about the connection economy?
Some have voted to cut themselves off from the network. In some ways, this isolationism is understandable. In the race to the bottom, a key job of our government is to build rails, to set limits, to ensure that standards are met. On top of that, we must work to ensure citizens are trained for what they can do next. When that doesn’t happen, it’s easy to blame the network, because it acts like a leaky pipe, not satisfying the people who have signed up to use it.
But the connection economy creates value. Not for everyone, not all the time, but it gets adopted because it works.Paretooptimality can’t be repealed–people and organizations working together are more productive than those working alone.
Our short-term challenge isn’t to get the good jobs back. That’s truly unlikely. No, the challenge is to embrace a different form ofeducationand training for a different world. And we must build and maintain a safety net as we go through this transition. People didn't ask for this revolution to happen.
[A surprisingbookon this topic, worth a read.]
It's not a matter of paying for it. In the winner-take-most world of the connection economy, there's plenty of wealth being amassed, and there's no reason to believe that society benefits from dramatic inequality. Creating pathways out of this inequality is what governments do when they're doing their job.
During the last forty years, as the computer and the network destroyed the system that our schools were built for, we (from the top down, and also, most definitely, from the bottom up) did almost nothing to change the schools we built.
Parents and the institutions they fund closed their eyes and only paid attention to SAT scores and famous colleges.
When a pre-employed person says, “I don’t know how to code and I’m not interested in selling,” we need to pause for a moment and think about what we built school for. When he continues, “I don’t really have anything interesting to say, and I'm not committed to making a particular change in the world, but I’m pretty good at following instructions,” we’re on the edge of a seismic shift in our culture. And not a positive one.
No, the good jobs aren’t coming back. But yes, there’s a whole host of a new kind of good job, one that feels fundamentally different from the old days. It doesn't look like a job used to look, but it's thechance of lifetimeif we can shift gears fast enough.
You don't have to like this shift, but ignoring it, yelling about it, cutting ourselves off from it is a recipe for a downward spiral. It's an opportunity if we let it be one.","July 7, 2016","Good jobs, connection economy, automation."
No one is unreasonable,"No one says, “I’m going to be unfair to this person today, brutal in fact, even though they don’t deserve it or it’s not helpful.”
Few people say, “I know that this person signed the contract and did what they promised, but I’m going to rip them off, just because I can.”
And it’s quite rare to have someone say, “I’m a selfish narcissist, and everyone should revolve around me merely because I said so.”
In fact, all of us have a narrative. It’s the story we tell ourselves about how we got here, what we’re building, what our urgencies are.
And within that narrative, we act in a way that seems reasonable.
To be clear, the narrative isn’ttrue. It’s merely our version, our self-talk about what’s going on. It’s the excuses, perceptions and history we’ve woven together to get through the world. It’s our grievances and our perception of privilege, our grudges and our loves.
No one is unreasonable. Or to be more accurate, no onethinksthat they are being unreasonable.
That’s why we almost never respond well when someone points out how unreasonable we’re being. We don’t see it, because our narrative of the world around us won’t allow us to. Our worldview makes it really difficult to be empathetic, because seeing the world through the eyes of someone else takes so much effort.
It’s certainly possible to change someone’s narrative, but it takes time and patience and leverage. Teaching a new narrative is hard work, essential work, but something that is difficult to do at scale.
In the short run, our ability to treat different people differently means that we can seek out people who have a narrative that causes them to engage with us in reasonable ways. When we open the door for these folks, we’re far more likely to create the impact that we seek. No one thinks they’re unreasonable, but you certainly don’t have to work with the people who are.
And, if you’re someone who finds that your narrative isn’t helping you make the impact you seek, best to look hard at your narrative, the way you justify your unreasonableness, not the world outside.","July 6, 2016","narrative, unreasonableness, empathy"
The signals we send,"Some people go through their day unaware that every action they pursue has more than its obvious intent.

You think you're merely putting on a blouse or typing an email or making small talk, but of course, you're also sending signals.
What we choose to do (and what we choose not to do) turns into a signal to the people around us.
These signals aren't universal, they are interpreted in different ways by people with different worldviews.
Some people are aware that they are sending signals, but can't quite figure out how to send the ones they mean to send.
And a few people send the signals on purpose.

Big company advertising,"American Airlines doesn't know what to say.
And they're having a lot of trouble saying it.
They're making a fortune this year due to low oil prices, and one way to manage shareholder expectations for the future is to put some of that profit into brand advertising. And so, they hired a fancy ad agency and started to run full-page, two-sided, glossy inserts in newspapers. The singleadI'm looking at cost at least $100,000. And I might be one of a hundred people who are actually reading it.
The copy-dense ad includes references to babies, red-eyes, noise, middle seats, lessons learned, 'relinquish', making the best of the situation and the ability to sleep anywhere. All told in an odd third-person, referring to the hero as ""they"" not ""you.""
With a layout that's so confusing that there's a big arrow that says ""start here"".
Some things worth remembering:
For thirty years, the airlines have relentlessly trained travelers to spend as little as possible on a seat, offering generic alternatives and contemptuous, confusing pricing policies.

Features and marginal cost in the digital age,"Good, better and best were the three price points.
Organizations had an easy way to distinguish between their various products. Adding more features cost more money, and so the Cadillac cost more than the Chevy.
Customers learned to associate more features with more expense with more luxury and exclusivity. And manufacturers were always on the lookout to add a feature that consumers valued more than the marginal cost of adding that feature.
In the digital age, all of this thinking goes out the window.
How much does it cost a car company to display the temperature outside? Well, it used to mean wiring a circuit, adding a sensor, creating a display. Now, it might cost them $1 (if that) to add that feature to a $40,000 car.
Even more radically, the marginal cost of just about every feature on a website or an app is precisely zero. Program it once and you can give it to everyone. The 'good' version is merely the 'best' version with some software turned off, which is fine if you don't have any competition.

There's not an absolute speed, a correct velocity, a posted limit or minimum for all of us. It's relative.
Given that, how does your speed match your goals and your strategy? Not compared to everyone else, but compared to the one and only thing you have control over?

Expectation is the brand killer,"There's a difference between speed and acceleration. This is hard for novice physics students to grasp. Velocity ( sometimes confused with speed) is how fast you're going in a given direction. Acceleration is a measure of how quickly you're getting faster (or slower) on your way.
Brands today are built on relationships, and relationships of all kinds work solely because of expectation. That thing we're confidently hoping we're going to get from that next encounter.
The shift we're facing is that expectation isn't the speed (the quality, the value, the repeatability of an interaction), it's now become more like the acceleration of it, thechangein what we expect.
And so advertisers and fashion houses and singles bars and Hallmark cards are built on promises. The promise of what to expect next.
The challenge: Expectations change. A few good encounters and we begin to hope for (and expect) great encounters. Sooner or later, our expectation for a politician or a motorcycle company or a service we regularly engage in goes up so much it can't be met.
When the economy is racing forward, people are engaged and satisfied. When it slows, when the good news slows down, people are even less satisfied than they were when they had fewer resources.
A common ridiculous expression is, ""expect the unexpected."" Of course, once you do that, it's not unexpected any more, is it?
Expectation is in the eye of the beholder, but expectation is often enhanced and hyped by the marketer hoping for a quick win.

Demand guardrails,"It's tempting to believe that left to our own devices, we'll all maximize our health, make smart investment decisions and generally follow our instincts on the road to happiness.
But it turns out that cigarettes are addictive, that financial distress causes people to make short-term decisions that are damaging, and that we even have trouble doing smart and easy things with a 401(k).
Culture is powerful. Marketing makes it even more powerful. Financial interests are powerful, too.
If peer pressure and short-term urgencies set us up to do things we regret, we come out ahead when we support cultural changes that remove that peer pressure and lessen those short-term urgencies.
We know that wearing abicycle helmetcan save us from years in the hospital, but some people feel awkward being the only one in a group to do so. A helmet law, then, takes away that problem and we come out ahead. Same forseat belts. One less decision to make.

Instead, the humans among us can benefit from realizing that in fact, we're deeply incompetent at making certain kinds of decisions, that well-funded marketers are working overtime to confuse and deceive us, and that cultural guardrails not only help us avoid pitfalls, but give us the reinforcements we need to get back to productive work and healthy lives.","August 26, 2016","guardrails, decision-making, cultural influences"
In pursuit of cheap,"The race to the bottom is unforgiving and relentless.
I ordered some straw hats for a small party. The shipper sent them in a plastic bag, with no box, because it was cheaper. Of course, they were crushed and worthless.
I wrote a note to the company's customer service address, but they merely sent an autoreply, because it was cheaper.
And they don't answer the phone… you guessed it, because it's cheaper.
Of course, you have competition. But the big companies that are winning the price war aren't winning because they've eliminated customer service and common sense. They're winning because of significant advances in scale and process, advances that aren't available to you.
Organizations panic in the face of the floor falling out from under their price foundation, and they often respond by becoming a shell of their former selves. Once you decide to become a cheap commodity, all of the choices you made to be a non-commodity fall victim to your pursuit of cheap.
Cheap is the last refuge for the marketer who can't figure out how to be better.

Graceful degradation,"Stuff's going to break.

Air conditioners, for example, gradually lose their charge. When they do, icing can occur. When that happens, the drain pans overflow and water seeps away.

Somewhere along the way, we accepted the baked-in, unchanging, what-you-see-is-what-you-get view of the world. It lets us off the hook, of course, because if this is the way we are, it’s certainly not our fault.
The bravest and most optimistic thing we can do, though, is see that each of us has the opportunity to do precisely the opposite. We have far more choices, far more control and far more responsibility than we give ourselves (and others) credit for.

“The main topic that’s been on everybody’s mind”,"Is almost never the one that's worth talking about.
The urgency of the day, today's celebrity crisis, the thing of the moment… that's what the media wants, that's what creates urgency, and that's what is most definitelynotimportant.
We now follow that same path at work.
No excuses for the reporter (and editor) that pursue a story merely because it's on everybody's mind. Or the boss or the VC, either. That's not a good enough reason to waste our attention on it.

Marketing in four steps,"The first step is to invent a thing worth making, a story worth telling, a contribution worth talking about.
The second step is to design and build it in a way that people will actually benefit from and care about.
The third one is the one everyone gets all excited about. This is the step where you tell the story to the right people in the right way.
The last step is so often overlooked: The part where you show up, regularly, consistently and generously, for years and years, to organize and lead and build confidence in the change you seek to make.","August 21, 2016","Marketing, Storytelling, Consistency"
Joint ownership,"Before you create intellectual property (a book, a song, a patent, the words on a website, a design) with someone else, agree in writing about who owns what, who can exploit it, what happens to the earnings, who can control its destiny.
This is sometimes an uncomfortable conversation to have, but it's far worse to have it later, after the thing you've created has been shown to have value.

Pattern matching as a shortcut to growth,"You have two choices when you want to move forward (grow a business, sell an idea, get a 'yes'):
Ms. Investor, you already invested in companies A, B, and C. We match that pattern.
Movie executive, you made a lot of money on three comedies for the young adult audience. We match that pattern.
Hey kid, you love to buy new flavors of chocolate bars, here's a new flavor.
You're used to taking pharmaceuticals, and thisplacebolooks just like one.
Most of the time, we look for patterns that match our habits. When we find a pattern match, we can embrace it without re-evaluating our beliefs.
On the other hand, moving all your data to the cloud, or staying at an Airbnb, these are new decisions, new ways of being in the world. Trying to get a book publisher to fund your magazine or your web app might make sense toyou, but without the benefit of a pattern to match, the publisher who has built a career around one pattern might get cold feet.
Human beings are pattern-matching machines. Changing our beliefs, though, is something we rarely do.It's far easier to sell someone on a new kind of fruit than it is to get them to eat crickets, regardless of the data you bring to the table.
It's tempting (and important) to improve the world by creating new beliefs. But it's far more reliable to match them.","August 19, 2016","pattern matching, growth, decision-making"
"Bureaucracy, success and the status quo","Every organization or project that succeeds begins to erect a bureaucracy around that success, because keeping success from going away is a basic need.
When you show up offering change, understand that the status quo isn't the enemy of the bureaucracy, it is their entire reason for being.
At some point, successful organizations stay successful by fighting off their instinct to support the bureaucracy. But far more often, people associate the bureaucracy with the organization's success, as though they are one and the same, and work overtime to protect it from anything that feels threatening.","August 18, 2016","Bureaucracy, success, status quo"
Function (and the dysfunctional organization),"Here's how you end up with a bully in a position of authority at an organization:
Someone points out that the bully is a real problem. And the boss says, ""I know he's a bully, but he's really productive and we can't afford to replace him.""
And here's how you end up with a naysayer, or a toxic co-worker:
Someone points out that people are afraid to work with this person. And the boss says, ""I know, but we really need her expertise.""
And, person by person, trait by trait, we build a broken organization because we believe that function trumps cooperation, inspiration and care.
Until it doesn't, and then, all we've got left is a mess.
The negative people who do nothing functional are an easy decision. It's the little compromises around people who seem to add value that corrupt what we seek to create.
Build a team of people who work together, who care and who learn and you'll end up with the organization you deserve. Build the opposite and you also get what you deserve.
Function is never an excuse for a dysfunctional organization, because we get the organization we compromise for.","August 17, 2016","bullying, dysfunctional organization, teamwork"
"Don’t argue about belief, argue about arguments","The essence of a belief is that we own it, regardless of what's happening around us. If you can be easily swayed by data, then it's not much of a belief.
On the other hand, the key to making a rational argument is that your assertions must befalsifiable.
""I believe A because of B and C."" If someone can show you that ""C"" isn't actually true, then it's not okay to persist in arguing ""A"".
The statement, ""All swans are white"" is falsifiable, because if I can find even one black swan, we're done.
On the other hand, ""The martians are about to take over our city with 2,000 flying saucers,"" is not, because there's nothing I can do or demonstrate that would satisfy the person who might respond, ""well, they're just very well hidden, and they're waiting us out.""
If belief in ""A"" is important to someone's story, people usually pile up a large number of arguments that are either not testable, or matters of opinion and taste. There's nothing wrong with believing ""A"", but it's counterproductive to engage with someone in a discussion about whether you're right or not. It's a belief, or an opinion, both of which are fine things to have, but it's not a logical conclusion or a coherent argument, because those require asserting something we can actually test.
The key question is, ""is there something I can prove or demonstrate that would make you stop believing in 'A'?"" If the honest answer is 'no', then we're not having an argument, are we?
Before we waste a lot of time arguing about something that appears to be a rational, logical conclusion, let's be sure we are both having the same sort of discussion.","August 16, 2016","belief, arguments, falsifiability"

Without training wheels,"If you'd like to teach a kid to ride a bike, training wheels are a bad idea. You're much better off with a small bike withnopedals.
All training wheels do is confuse, distract or stall.
The same thing is true for marketing. You don't need to go to school for four years. You need to do marketing. Find a worthy charity and do a promotional event to raise money for them (you don't even need to ask first). Start a micro business. Sell things on eBay.
And the same thing is true for leadership. Find something worth doing, find others to join in.
Merely begin.","August 14, 2016","bike riding, marketing, leadership"
Uniquely unique,"Of course, each of us is different. Different histories, different narratives. You have an appendix, she doesn't. You are different from everyone else, from your DNA to the kind of morning you had today.
No one can possibly understand you completely.
The same thing is true for your organization, but multiplied by (or even raised to the power of) the number of people who work there.
Such complexity. Originality. Unique uniqueness.
And yet…
And yet we can go to the same doctors.
And yet we can read the same books.
And yet it's possible our organizations can benefit from the same interventions and insights.
Because, while we're each unique, we have far more in common than we're comfortable admitting. Amplifying our differences may make us feel special, but it's not particularly useful when it comes to getting better.
Being unique is a great way to hide from the change we need when someone offers us a better future. Learning from the patterns and the people who have come before, though, is the only way any of us advance.","August 13, 2016","uniqueness, change, learning"
Three things about good jobs in a new economy,"The reason that Uber drivers will always struggle
They don't have a relationship with the customer. It turns out that finding a customer and knowing where he wants to go is almost as valuable as having a car and knowing how to drive it. Because Uber and other middlemen are earning permission to connect with their customers, the driver will always get the short end of the stick.
They can easily replace the driver, but the driver can't easily replace Uber.
It's clearly difficult to gain the trust and attention of customers. Which is precisely why it's the best way to build an asset.
The world is here, knocking at our door
TheAlmondrange extender is a pretty cool wifi device. Mine had a hiccup, so I called tech support. In just a few minutes on a toll free line, Maan Thapa graciously identified and fixed my problem, throwing in a few suggestions as well. Maan is from Nepal and he works in India. The Almond is manufactured in Taipei and their marketing is done in Dubai.
Proximity is overrated.
If the boss can write it down, she can find someone cheaper than you to do the work
Probably a robot. The best jobs are jobs where we don't await instructions, where using good judgment and taking initiative are far more important than obedience.
The economy is now powered by connection, not industry. Connection and innovation and the instant movement of data means that the rules most of us grew up with are quickly becoming obsolete.
InLinchpinandIcarus, I laid out the math of our future at work. All the demagoguery doesn't matter, because those old-fashioned, well-paid common factory jobs, powered by a steam engine or an assembly line—they're not coming back.
Instead, we have a chance to invent something extraordinary in their place.","August 12, 2016","Uber, connection economy, job evolution"
I knew it!,"Sometimes, news comes along that confirms something we've wanted to believe all along.
It usually amplifies our skepticism.
But sometimes, it reinforces our trust.

The two risk mistakes,"Risk mistake number one:Risk means failure.
This worldview equates any risk, no matter how slim, with a certainty. If the chances of hurting yourself skydiving are 1%, it's easy to ignore the 99% likelihood that it will go beautifully.
If you carry this worldview around, you're not going to take many risks, because your fundamental misunderstanding is that whatever is uncertain is bad.
Risk mistake number two:Low risk events don't happen.
This is the stock investor who freaks out when the market doesn't go up the way he and everyone else expected it to. The reason that some investments offer higher returns is that they're not guaranteed to work. Implicit in that high return, then, is the clear warning that sometimes, you won't get what you're hoping for.
I'm not distinguishing between optimism and pessimism. The optimist is well aware of risks, but deep down, she believes that things are going to get better. The risk-blind individual, though, is willfully (or perhaps ignorantly) unaware of what risk actually is.
Most of the things that we do have two possible outcomes: they might work or they might not. Being able to live with the possibility of either is essential if we're going to move forward.","August 8, 2016","risk, failure, investment"
It happens around the edges,"At any gathering of people, from a high school assembly to the General Assembly at the UN, from a conference to a rehearsal at the orchestra, the really interesting conversations and actions almost always happen around the edges.
If you could eavesdrop on the homecoming queen or the sitting prime minister, you'd hear very little of value. These folks think they have too much to lose to do something that feels risky, and everything that's interesting is risky.
Change almost always starts at the edges and moves toward the center.","August 7, 2016","edges, conversations, change"
"Scientist, Engineer and Operations Manager","A career is often based on one of these three stances:
The Scientist does experiments. Sometimes they work, sometimes they fail. She takes good notes. Comes up with a theory. Works to disprove it. Publishes the work. Moves on to more experiments.
The Engineer builds things that work. Take existing practices, weave them together and create a bridge that won't fall down, write code that won't crash, design an HR department that's efficient and effective.
The Operations Manager takes the handbook and executes on it. Brilliantly. Promises, kept. Hands on, full communications, on time.
The scientist invents the train. The engineer builds it out. The operations manager makes it run on time.
Operations managers shouldn't do experiments. Scientists shouldn't ask for instructions on what to do next. Engineers shouldn't make stuff up…

Conservation and concentration of effort,"The woman sitting next to me on the plane is successful by any measure–she's happy, engaged, making a difference.
And she confessed that she doesn't buy anything from Amazon, doesn't use Facebook, rarely connects online.
How is this possible?
I think it's because true effort multipliers are rare indeed. Without a doubt, a good tool helps us do a task better, but often, particularly online, there's so much effort and overhead and fear associated with the tools we use that sometimes they don't leverage our work as much as we give them credit for.
It might be that time spent knitting, reading, being introspective and digging deep is more productive than checking a Twitter feed just one more time.

Of course we are. We always are. We're always headed down for the count. It's unsustainable. We corrupt our best stuff, don't take good enough care of each other, ignore the truth, make short-term decisions and generally screw it up.
But even though we're headed for extinction, or perhaps preciselybecausewe are, that doesn't mean we can't do our best. It doesn't mean we can't set an example, raise the bar and try mightily to do the work that we're capable of.

Reviewing a contract,"A deal, whether in writing or orally, is not to be considered lightly, because you fully expect to keep your end of the bargain. Three things to consider before saying, ""yes"":

What happens if things don't work out:If you don't do what you say you'll do, what happens? If the other person can't pay or can't deliver, or wants to walk away, then what? When you leave yourself (and the other person) an out, you're almost certainly investing in a better future, because you know in advance what the options are.

The struggle to raise money,"When your small business is struggling, the thought of raising money feels like a life preserver.
That possible infusion of cash is a beacon of hope, the thing you can work on tirelessly. It's the one thing that appears as though it will make everything better.
Careful. It's often a detour, a distraction that won't pan out at the very same time it takes your eye off the real issues.
The problem starts with this: Few people will tell you to stop trying to raise money. They'll encourage you to polish your business plan, make more pitches, add more rigor, dream bigger.
Add to this that it's essentially impossible to build a 1000x company, but those are the ones that get all the hype and the ones that investors crave. So you're comparing yourself to something that's quite elusive.
And finally, as you get deeper and deeper into the quest, there are individuals and institutions that will happily take advantage of you, requiring you to personally guarantee debt, to give up control, to turn your dream project into something you never envisioned.
The reason for this money trap is that so many small-business owners confuse raising money for expenses with raising money to build an asset.This is worth understanding.
If you can say, ""I will spend this money on X, and X will make Y happen, and Y will pay off handsomely,"" then a professional investor ought to be open to hearing that story.
But the things to spend money on are a significant real estate presence, machines, patents, a permanent, expensive brand. The entrepreneur who spends this money does it with enthusiasm, because she's buying things that are going to grow in value, fast.
This is the painting contractor who realizes that a high-powered industrial paint booth will make him the only guy in town who can do a certain kind of job. Or the fast food impresario who asserts that opening ten restaurants in one town in one year will give her the footprint to be more efficient and profitable.
But that's not the way most small business folks are wired.
We're wired to delight our customers, charge for what we do, and then spend some of that money to do it again.
If that sounds like you, pretend that it's not even possible to raise money from investors. Take the option off the table (where it isn't, really).
Instead, spend that energy and that passion and that focus to raise money from your customers. To delight more customers often enough that they happily pay you for what you can do for them. And then repeat. And again.
It's not a life preserver. Not at all. It's a stepwise path, a ramp from here to there, a process with no guru, no miracle, no signing bonus. It's merely the work.

Dropping the narrative,"Okay, you don’t like what your boss did yesterday or last week or last month. But today, right now, sitting across the table, what’s happening?
Narrating our lives, the little play-by-play we can’t help carrying around, that’s a survival mechanism. But it also hotwires our feelings, changes our posture, limits our possibilities.
What does this human feel right now? What opportunities to make a connection, to grow, to impact exist that we’ve ignored because of the story we are telling ourselves about them?
The narrative is useful as long as it’s useful, helping you solve problems and move forward. But when it reinforces bad habits or makes things smaller, we can drop it and merely be present, right here, right now.","September 30, 2016","mindfulness, narrative, presence"

Choosing and preparing for the job you’ll do for the next career is a much more important task than getting that job. Serving is more important than the campaign.
And a marriage is always more important than a wedding.
It’s tempting to focus on the product launch, on the interview, on the next thing. Tempting, but ultimately a waste.

Spectator sports,"Every year, we spend more than a trillion dollars worth of time and attention on organized spectator sports.
The half-life of a sporting event is incredibly short. Far more people are still talking about the Godfather movie or the Nixon administration than care about the 1973 World Series.
Billions of people buying tickets and investing countless hours on something of absolutely no significance.
It turns out that this insignificance and the ephemeral nature of sporting events is the heart of their appeal.
Instead of having passionate arguments about things that matter, issues with consequences, topics where one can be wrong or right, organized sports are a tribal opportunity to vent without remorse.
We've taken that pleasure in insignificance and transferred it to celebrity culture as well. And then on to just about everything else, including science and governance.
Hence the challenge–because when we start to treat things of significance as if they're a spectator sport, we all lose.
Soccer hooligans are a real problem. But hooligans in science (yelling about their opinions, denigrating their opponents) or in world affairs do none of us any good.","September 26, 2016","spectator sports, insignificance, tribalism"
Anxiety loves company,"Somehow, at least in our culture, we find relief when others are anxious too.
So we spread our anxiety, stoking it in other people, looking for solace in the fear in their eyes.
And thanks to the media, to the microphone we each have, to our hyper-connected culture, it’s easier than ever to spread our anxiety if we choose. And when someone who seeks power offers to hear our anxiety in exchange for attention or a vote, it gets even worse.
It’s worth noting that there’s no correlation between the real world and anxiety. In fact, it’s probably the opposite–when times are good, people with a lot to lose start to get that itch.

Looking for the trick,"When you find a trick, a shortcut, a hack that gets you from here to there without a lot of sweat or risk, it's really quite rewarding. So much so that many successful people are hooked on the trick, always looking for the next one.
SEO, for example, had plenty of tricks as it evolved, ways in which a few worked to get rankings and links without deserving them.
Or consider the act of publishing a book. One approach is to spend a lot of time and money tricking the system into believing your book is already successful, which, the trick says, will lead to it becoming actually successful.
Or the simple trick to avoid belly fat, lose weight, get a promotion, find dates or make money overnight.
I could list a thousand of them, because the web is trick central, a place where, for a short while, the people apparently at the top of whatever heap you aspire to got there by finding and exploiting a trick.
There's a meta-trick that's far more reliable. One that works over time and doesn't depend on avoiding being out-tricked:Make great stuff.Satisfy needs. Do the hard work that leads to growth which leads to investment on its own merit.
It turns out that the trick-free approach is the best trick of all.

If it's important, but innate, it's a talent.
The thing is, almost everything that matters is a skill. If even one person is able to learn it, if even one person is able to use effort and training to get good at something, it's a skill.
It's entirely possible that some skills are easier for talented people to learn. It's entirely possible you don't want to expend the energy and dedicate the effort to learn that next skill.

Widespread confusion about what it takes to be strong,"Sometimes we confuse strength with:
Well, once you put it that way, it's pretty clear that none of these things are actually signs of strength.
In fact, they are symptoms of brittleness, of insecurity and of a willful disconnect from the things that matter.
Individuals, organizations, brands and leaders all have a chance to be strong. And can just easily choose to be jerks.

Big fish in a little pond,"There's no doubt that the big fish gets respect, more attention and more than its fair share of business as a result.
The hard part of being a big fish in a little pond isn't about being the right fish. It's about finding the right pond.
Too often, we're attracted to a marketplace (a pond) that's huge and enticing, but being a big fish there is just too difficult to pull off with the resources at hand.
It makes more sense to get better at finding the right pond, at setting aside our hubris and confidence and instead settling for a pond where we can do great work, make a difference, and yes, be a big fish.
When in doubt, then, don't worry so much about the size of the fish. Focus instead on the size of your pond.","September 21, 2016","big fish, right pond, marketplace"
Three things to keep in mind about your reputation,"In a connection economy, what other people think about you, their expectations of you, the promises they believe you make—this is your brand. It's easy to imagine that good work is its own reward, but good work is only of maximum value when people get your reputation right, and they usually get that fromothers, not directly from you.
It's logical, then, to care about how your reputation is formed. But it's dangerous, I think, to decide that it's worth spending a lot of time gaming the system, to consistently work hard to make your reputation better than you actually are.
There is one exception: The most important step you can take when entering a new circle, a new field or a new network is to take vivid steps to establish a reputation. This is the new kid who stands up to a bully the first day of school, or a musician who holds off on a first single until she's got something to say. They say you never get a second chance to make a first impression, but what most people do is make no impression at all.
That reputation needs to be one you can live with for the long haul, because you'll need to.
As the social networks make it more and more difficult for people to have a significant gap between reputation and reality (hence gossip), the single best strategy appears to be as you are, or more accurately, to live the life you've taught people to expect from you.
Your reputation isn't merely based on your work, it's often the result of biases and expectations that existed before you even showed up. That's not fair but it's certainly true. Now that we see that the structures exist, each of us has the ability to over-invest in activities and behaviors that maximize how we'll be seen by others before we arrive.
Be your reputation, early and often, and you're more likely to have a reputation you're glad to own.","September 20, 2016","Reputation, Brand, Perception"
Understanding taxonomy,"If you need to add a word to the dictionary, it's pretty clear where it goes. The dictionary is a handy reminder of how taxonomies work. The words aren't sorted by length, or frequency or date of first usage. They're sorted by how they're spelled. This makes it easy to find and organize.
The alphabet is an arbitrary taxonomy, without a lot of wisdom built in (are the letters in that order because of the song?).
It's way more useful to consider taxonomies that are based on content or usage.
Almost everything we understand is sorted into some sort of taxonomy. Foods, for example: we understand intuitively that chard is close to spinach, not chicken, even though the first two letters are the same.
The taxonomy of food helps you figure out what to eat next, because you understand what might be a replacement for what's not available.
Shopify has more in common with Udemy (both tech startups) than it does with the Bank of Canada (both based in Ottawa).
Your job, if you want to explain a field, if you want to understand it, if you want to change it, is to begin with the taxonomy of how it's explained and understood.
Once you understand a taxonomy, you've got a chance to re-organize it in a way that is even more useful.
Too often, we get lazy and put unrelated bullet points next to each other, or organize in order of invention. For example, we teach high school biology before (and separate from) chemistry, even though you can't understand biology without chemistry (and you can certainly understand chemistry without biology). We do this because we started working on biology thousands of years before we got smart about chemistry, and the order stuck.
The reason an entrepreneur needs a taxonomy is that she can find the holes, and figure out how to fill them.
And a teacher needs one, because creating a mental model is the critical first step in understanding how the world works.

The post-reality paradox,"Reality and rational thought have paid more dividends in the last century than ever before.
Science-based medicine has dramatically increased the lifespan and health of people around the world. Vaccines have prevented millions ofchildrenfrom lifelong suffering and even death. Evidence-based trials have transformed the output of farms, the way organizations function and yes, even the yield of websites.
It's possible to imagine a world of 6 billion people without the advances we've enjoyed, but you wouldn't want to live there.
It's not just the obvious outcomes of engineering and scientific success. It's also the science of decision making and the reliance on a civil society, both of which require the patience to see the long term.
For someone willing to engage in a discussion based on data, there is no doubt that this approach is working. It works so well, it’s easy to take it for granted, to assume that miracles will keep coming, that the systems will keep working, that the bridges and the water systems won’t fail and the missiles won't be launched. It's easy to lose interest in spreading these benefits to those that don't have them yet.
At the very same time that engineering put us on the moon, post-reality thinking invented a conspiracy that it didn’t happen. When we get close to eradicating an illness, we hesitate and focus on rumor and innuendo instead.
While reality-based medicine has ameliorated some of the worst diseases humans have ever experienced, quack medicines have been on the upswing for the ones that remain.
The most famous doctor in the country, Mehmet Oz, is primarily known for blurring the lines. His gifted medical talents have saved lives in the operating room, but he’s just as likely to talk about a quack diet based on coffee beans. There's been huge forward progress in the science of medicine, but all the money and attention on placebos hasn't improved their outcome much.
When Hillary Clinton lies, her standing decreases. But when Donald Trump lies, it actuallyhelpshis standing among his followers. That’s because he’s not selling reality, he’s selling something else. It’s confusing to outsiders, because he’s not working on the same axis as traditional candidates.
The hallmark of post-reality thinking is that it watches the speech with the sound turned off. The words don't matter nearly as much as the intent, the emotion, the subtext. When we engage in this more primeval, emotional encounter, we are more concerned with how it looks and feels than we are in whether or not the words actually make sense.
The irony, then, is that people who have been cut off from clean water, from things that actually work, from the fruits of a reality-based system that changed everything—these people are hungering for it, want it for their children. But for those that have taken it for granted, who have the luxury of using it without understanding it, the pendulum swings in the other direction, seeking an emotional response to economic and technical disconnects.
The more that reality-based thinking has created a comfortable existence, the more tempting it is to ignore it and embrace a nonsensical, skeptical viewpoint instead.
We used to be able to talk about scienceandbelief, about what’s realandwhat we dream of. Theandwas the key part of the sentence, it wasn’t one against the other.
If they are seen asor, though, if it’s belief (anger or fear) against/vs./or the reality of what’s here and what’s working, we do ourselves, and our children, a tragic disservice.

What’s at the bottom of the river?,"I have no idea if the bottom of the Hudson River is smooth or not. I know that on a calm day, the surface is like glass.
One reason to lower the water level of a system you count on is to see what's messing things up. You can discover what happens when you operate without slack, without a surplus… you want to know what's likely to get in the way…
This is the essence of Toyota'squalitybreakthrough. When Toyota got rid of all the extra car parts held in reserve on the assembly line, every single one of them had to be perfect. If a nut or bolt didn't fit, the entire line stopped. No cars got made until the part was perfect.
This seems insane. Why would you go through the pain of removing the (relatively) low cost buffer of some extra parts? The answer, it turns out, is that without a buffer, you've lowered the water level and you can see the rocks below. Without a buffer, every supplier had to dramatically up his game. Suddenly, the quality of parts went way up, which, of course, makes the assembly line go faster and every car ends up working better as well.
Fedex had to build a system far more efficient than the one they use at the Post Office. When you only have 12 hours to deliver a package, the rocks will kill you. Now, when they need to deliver something in three days, they're still way better at it than the post office is. Fewer rocks.
The purpose of sprinting without slack isn't that you will always be sprinting, always without extra resources or a net.

A hierarchy of value when everything functions,"When two things offer simply the same appropriate level of function, we'll choose the cheap one.
But if one offers more connection than the other, it is worth more. This hotel over that one. Where is the tribe, do people like me do things like this, who's there, will they miss me, do I trust them, have I been here before…
If two items offer connection, but one offers the approval and sexiness that style brings, some of us will pay extra for that. After all, style promises ever more connection.
And at the top of the hierarchy is our quest for scarcity, desire and the hotness of now.
In a market like smartphones, it's pretty clear that it's really difficult to offer more function than the other guy. And the quality of connection, the very attribute that fuels the smartphone, was surrendered to the app makers a long time ago. Which leaves the sexiness of a drop-dead case and the urgency of the latest model.
What do you and your team offer? Where are you in the hierarchy?
Most freelancers have been so beaten down in the quest to make a go of it, they stop at function and take what they can get. Some businesses (small and large) find the patience and guts to offer connection or even style. And every once in awhile, an idea and an organization come along that promise to share the elusive hot that sits atop the pyramid.
So, buy a Harley, not because it can move you from here to there cheaper, but because it comes with a tribe. And buy that Nars lipstick because of the way it makes you feel. And get on line for that new gadget, because, hey, there's a line.

I've written in the past aboutluxurygoods and the value of physical artifacts in adigitalworld.
A book is a special object, a time-tested conveyor of not just information, but emotion and connection. Some of my best friends are books.
This summer, I put together a worldwide team to create a book that might be worth owning, saving and sharing. The goal was to create a substantial (okay, huge) and beautiful book that would be scarce, valuable and worth it.
We sent the files to the printer last week, and I couldn't be more excited about what we've created. You can see some sample pages and read about the history of the projecthere. It's absolutely the most beautiful thing I've ever been privileged to put my name on. It weighs more than 15 hardcover books and is 800 pages long.
All the words are already online for free (it's a collection of my online writing over the last four years). What you can't get online, though, is the feeling of owning it and the joy of gifting it.
A few thousand people pre-ordered their reserved copy last week, and now we're opening a window for pre-ship orders. As I write this there are fewer than 2,400 copies available for sale between now and September 9th. There will be one more window at a higher price for any remaining copies in November when the books begin to ship.
There's only one printing, and when the book is gone, that's all there is.
The book doesn't actually cost $400 or even half that, but the shipping fees to some countries are ridiculous. We worked hard to create something inspiring and timeless, and we're doing our best to get it to the few people who would like to be part of this journey.

The second can't be fixed with money. These are issues of trust or judgment. Horrific injuries or crimes against nature. An old growth forest doesn't grow back merely because you pay the trees more.
The third, of course, are problems that appear that they can be solved with money, but can't. They range from the mythical man-month to the relationship that uses resources as a false proxy for other things yet to be discussed. Culture, process and expectations are tempting targets, but the resources spent often make the problem worse in the long run.

A few simple understandings and principles:
The percentage matters, in the sense that chocolate that is between 70% and 90% dark is a Platonic ideal of flavor. I avoid flavoring agents like candies, seeds or salt, because what I'm trying to taste is the bean and what the maker has done to bring it to life.
The kind ofbeanmatters. Forastero beans are cheap, easy to grow and not particularly worth seeking out (with a few exceptions). On the other hand, Criollo (particularly the wonderful rare Porcelana hybrid which you can find from Soma and Original Beans) is a party in your mouth–but, alas, the hardest to grow. It's always that way, isn't it? And Trinitario beans are the backbone of this hobby.
The country matters. Yes, with practice, it's actually easy to tell the difference between Madagascar and Colombia.
And finally, the farmer'srelationship with the growermatters a lot. Askinosie imports their own beans, and does amazing work with the farmers who work so hard to grow them.

What does the poll say?,"It says that people don't understand polls. Even smart marketers get it wrong.
What do people think? There's a lot of confusion, much of it intentional, some spawned by a presumed fear of simple math, all of it worth clearing up.
A survey is not a poll is not a census.A census is what you get if you ask every single person what they think or who they are. There are only two reasons to have a census. Either you want each person to feel personally involved (hence an election) or you are keeping track of each person's answer. For example, if you're printing up t-shirts for the Frisbee team, you ought to do a census of the team to find out what size each person wants, then deliver each person the size they seek.
You could do a survey, which is merely a collection of answers from whomever cares enough to answer the survey. A survey is a useful tool for brainstorming, but it shouldn't be confused with what the group actually feels. Your lack of rigor in setting it up is repaid in a lack of precision in the data.
And a poll? A poll is a smart shortcut, a statistical method for replacing a census (asking everyone) with a very close approximation achieved by asking the minimum number of people required to get a useful answer. A properly done poll will get you an answer nearly as useful as an accurate census will, without the expense or the time.
It rarely makes sense to ask all of your customers about how they feel. You're wasting their time (and yours) by adding more entries into the database without those entries actually making the database any more accurate—part of the problem is that the only people who answer surveys are annoyed or have nothing better to do, and simply making a poll bigger doesn't make it better.
When big companies ask you to fill out a quick survey after talking to a customer service rep, they're not actually doing a survey. What they're doing is snooping on their customer service people, and your answers are directly connected back to each rep, so that person can be scolded (or worse) if they do a bad job.
A poll doesn't predict the future.The media has completely missed this point, again and again. If, on the day the iPhone was announced, you had done a well-designed poll of adults and asked, ""Do you intend to ever buy a smartphone?"" the yesses would have certainly been less than 5% of the result.
Of course, a decade later, that's turned out to be completely wrong. Was the poll in error?
No.
An accurate poll is a snapshot of right now, based on what's happening today. That's all. If outcomes end up being different a week or a year later, that's not the poll's fault, it's our mistaken belief that the future can be predicted.
To go one step further, the question that gets asked is as important as the answer. Try this at home: When you ask people a question, they rarely give you the straight up truth in their answer, especially when there are social factors at play. The very best polls combine not only the right math, but more important,the right question structure.
The magic of sample size. Let's say you had a bag of M&Ms. You know they come in six colors and you want to figure out the percentage of each that's in the bag. As long as the candies are distributed within the bag, it turns out that no matter how many are in the bag, whether it's a 2 pound bag or a 2,000 pound bag, all you need to do is randomly pull out 300 to 400 M&Ms. That's plenty. More samples won't dramatically increase thequalityof this poll.
The purpose of the sample is to pick a random selection from a coherent group.
The key to this is understanding that sample size is relevant for any sized group that's consistent in its makeup. As soon as you can divide the group into buckets, you benefit by doing multiple samples.
Most of the well-done polls you hear about in public do not have a sample size problem. It's a red herring.
The power of bucketing.But what happens if you realize that there are more than one kind of M&Ms, and that different kinds have different color distributions? (This, it turns out, for mysterious reasons, is true. Almond M&Ms only come in five colors).
Well, you could take this into account and run much bigger sample groups, or you could get smart about sample size.
It turns out, for example, that women who ride Harley Davidson motorcycles want different things from them than men do. It also turns out that (I'm guessing about all the Harley stats here) perhaps 10% of the people who buy a Harley are women.
Given that, you could poll 300 women (the easy minimum) and then 2700 men (so you get the balance right). OR, you could get smart, and poll 300 women and 300 men (because every time you add a new person, it's really expensive). ""But wait,"" you might say, ""that's not right, because women are overrepresented.""
So far, that's true. But after you figure out how women think, and then figure out how men think, you can weight the men's results in your final tally. If, for example, you discovered that women intend to buy a new Harley every two years, but men intend to buy one every six years, you could then report back that the average customer intends to buy a new Harley every five and a half years or so.  (Said with full knowledge that it's dangerous to average averages, but in this case, it's correct.)
Confusion about polls is easy.And the more we try to make decisions using polls, the more careful we need to be about the structure and motivation of the poll itself.
But finding an accurate poll is pretty easy as well. Most pollsters (in private and in public work) are transparent about their methods, and the magic of statistics is that the math of how the poll is structured can be checked by others.
Too often, marketers do surveys, not polls, or bother everyone with a census, poorly done. Worse, they then use these results as an accurate prediction of the future, instead of a reliable snapshot of now.
It's the surveys that are so often wrong, deceptive and confusing. It's surveys (""no one I know believes that"") that feel like they're accurate but rarely are.
And if we're going to challenge a poll, far smarter to challenge the questions (""that's designed to get the respondent to lie"") or the flaws in sampling (""this requires all polled individuals to have a home phone, but of course, an entire generation of young people don't have one."")
But it makes no sense at all to throw out the results of polls we disagree with. The quality of the cars we drive, the efficacy of the medicines we take are all directly related to the very same statistical techniques that we use to run a poll. Ask the right questions to the right people and your snapshot is going to be helpful.
If you want to, be wary of polls. But be wary for the right reasons.",,"polls, surveys, statistics"

Decoding pro wrestling,"Professional wrestling is fake.
The blood is fake, the lack of physics is fake, the arguing with the ref is fake, the rivalries are fake… it might be professional, but it's not real.
This willful disregard for reality is at the heart of pro wrestling. It's a juvenile fantasy, come to life. An opportunity to make up the rules, ignore authority, and exert bullying force on others, merely because you can.
So why is Billy Corgan (of Smashing Pumpkins) one of the most successful musicians of our generation,runninga pro wrestling organization?
He says it's because it's one of the last transgressive arenas left. That it's a morality play, a microcosm of the human condition, a chance to put on a show that highlights our fears and our avarice. He knows that it's fake, authenticity is a foreign concept in this world.
And what lesson can we learn from politicsimportingpro wrestling's mindset? Once you see it, you can't unsee the connection. Worth noting that one of the key narratives of pro wrestling is the fake within the fake–someone is always claiming that the outcome is rigged. (In wrestling, of course, itisrigged. And so is the complaining.)
Pro wrestling works as a play and a medium because the people who are part of itrealizethat it's fake.
It turns out that modern media is a perfect match for the pro-wrestling approach. You can put on a show, with your own media, as often as you like. And that show is, to many, remarkable, and so it spreads.
And there lies the danger, the opportunity for pro-wrestling thinking to corrupt our society: When the fans, or worse, the participants, don't realize that it's fake.

The filter bubble creates an echo chamber, and reality stars are pushed to be more like cartoonish pro wrestlers and less like responsible human beings. If it bleeds, it leads.
You probably work with people who are living in their own pro wrestling universe. These are people who are so in love with their version of reality and their goals that they view the real world as an affront, an intrusion on the way they insist things turn out.

Two kinds of filters,"There's the filter bubble of the internet, in which we willingly surround ourselves only with information sources with which we agree, soon coming to the conclusion that everyone agrees with us.
The other kind is the filter we can choose to build to avoid falling into a rabbit hole of wasted time, misogyny and dissatisfaction. This is to avoid the endless clicking, the hateful comments, the mind-numbing noise of the net.
Here's a hint: The first kind of filter is easy to build and satisfying in the short run. It's reassuring to believe we're right.
The second kind, the one that builds a foundation for us to do better work, is always under attack from within and without, and it's tempting to stop using it. Tempting to give up, but ultimately worth the effort.
The easier the filter is to build, the less it's worth.","October 28, 2016","filter bubble, information sources, mindful filtering"
One way to get a raise,"…is to get promoted.
And the best way to get promoted is to learn something new and get good at it. Take a course. Learn to sell. Public speaking. Statistics. Become the person that your organization wants in a bigger role. You can accelerate that process with deliberate learning and practice.
Smart companies will pay for it if you ask. After all, it's a high-return investment in the very people who do the work. Organizations have learned that it is significantly cheaper to grow their people than it is to hire pre-grown people from outside.
Consider that thealtMBAhas been taken by leaders from organizationsbig and small, including Microsoft, DHL, Intel, and Warby Parker. Inevitably, our alumni become more valuable contributors.
Many companies that offer tuition reimbursement are frustrated that employees rarely ask for it. Bosses realize how useful this investment is, they're just waiting for you to take them up on it.
It might feel awkward to ask your boss if you can take a course (after all, employees are supposed to be perfect, right?) but in fact, one of the biggest insights that growing companies have is that they're only as good as their smartest people.
And their best people realize that getting smarter is the only way to avoid falling behind…","October 27, 2016","raise, promotion, professional development"
Fear of outsiders,"Just in time for Halloween, some thoughts on our fear of the other, the people in the shadows, or merely those that don't look like us.
It's tempting to rile yourself up about the 'other'.
But that's not the real challenge.
The challenge is inside. It's the self-sabotage. The projects not shipped, the hugs not given, the art not made.
The real boogeyman isn't the other. The one we're afraid of is with us all the time.","October 26, 2016","fear, self-sabotage, otherness"
On being irritated,"Irritation is a privilege.
It's the least useful emotion, one that we never seek out.
People in true distress are never irritated. Someone who is hungry or drowning or fleeing doesn't become irritated.
And of course, irritation rarely helps us get what we need.
Irritation clouds our judgment, frustrates our relationships and gets our priorities all wrong.
Irritation tries to persuade us that it's justified, but it merely pushes us away from what we actually need.
In order to be irritated, we need to believe we're not getting something we deserve. But of course, that expectation is the cause of the irritation. We can choose to lose the expectation, embracing the fact that we're lucky enough to feel it, and then get back to work doing something generous instead.
It turns out that irritation is a privilege and irritation is a choice.","October 25, 2016","Irritation, Emotion, Choice"
Moral hazard and inhumanity,"One bit of economic reasoning says, ""If there are no consequences, people will make bad choices.""
Don't let big banks get bailouts, because if we do, bankers will take bigger risks.
So, make sure that the dentist is expensive (and painful) because that will encourage people to brush their teeth.
And don't make it too easy to collect on fire insurance, or people will be careless with matches.
Insurers call these behaviors 'moral hazards.' (And some call them 'morale hazards' fyi). In specific instances, people will make choices that cause harm to themselves and to society because they don't fear the consequences.
Without a doubt, this makes sense for organizations.
But the instances are more specific than you might guess. For example, awareness of the certainty of lung cancer forty years later doesn't do much to keep teens from smoking. The long-term consequences didn't matter—it was a tax on cigarettes that made the biggest difference.
And telling a mentally ill homeless person that he 'deserves' to live on the street because of bad choices along the way isn't doing anything for him, or to those that might be forced into his situation down the road.
Waiting for an employee to screw up so we can fire her seems a convoluted way to set a standard for the rest of the team.
Too often, we get confused aboutwhat people deserve vs. what they get. We use our instinctual, Calvinist understanding of moral hazard as an excuse to teach people a lesson, to callously embrace an efficient market. But of course, the market isn't efficient at all. It unevenly distributes rewards to people based on luck, and allows those with an early head start to amplify that lead with less and less effort.
It turns out thatbuilding homesfor homeless people is a great way to cut homelessness overall.Povertydoesn't usually respond to moral hazard approaches.

"Hardware is sexy, but it’s software that matters","You can make software if you choose to.
Not just the expected version of software that runs on a computer, but the metaphorical idea of rules and algorithms designed to solve problems and connect people…
Apple started as a hardware company with the Apple II. Soon in, they realized that while hardware is required, it's software that changes the world.
For years, the Mac was merely a container for Mac software. It was the software that enabled the work we created, it was software that shifted our relationship with computers and ultimately each other.
Over the last five years, Apple has lost the thread and chosen to become a hardware company again. Despite their huge profits and large staff, we're confronted with (a partial list):
Some simple principles:
This is more than a rant about Apple. Any company that makes or uses software has a wide-open opportunity to dramatically change the way we engage. Hardware, on the other hand, often closes more doors than it opens.

Beating yourself up,"This odd behavior mostly shows up when others are criticizing us, disappointed or angry about something we did. Odd because it's so useless.
In those moments, there are already plenty of other people beating you up. Save yourself the trouble.
The rest of the time, when things are going well, it's foolish to stop and engage in self-criticism. It makes more sense to encourage yourself, to bootstrap your way to even more of a ruckus.
So, the moments left to beat yourself up = zero.

Making a new decision based on new information,"This is more difficult than it sounds.
To some people, it means admitting you were wrong.
(But of course, you weren't wrong. You made a decision based on one set of facts, but now you're aware of something new.)
To some people, sunk costs are a real emotional hot button, and walking away from investments of time, of money, and mostly, of commitment, is difficult.
(But of course, ignoring sunk costs is a key to smart decision making).
And, to some people, the peer pressure of sticking with the group that you joined when you first made a decision is enough to overwhelm your desire to make a better decision. ""What will I tell my friends?""
A useful riff you can try:
Sure, I decided thatthen, when I knew what I knewthen. And if the facts were still the same, my decision would be too. But the facts have changed. We've all heard them. New facts mean it's time for me to make a new decision, without regard for what I was busy doing yesterday, without concern for the people who might disagree with me. My guess is that once they realize these new facts, they're likely to make the same new decision I just did.
This decision is more important than my pride.

Differences,"If you're sharing a cab to the airport with a stranger, what happens if he's two inches taller than you? Probably nothing. There's nothing to distract, or to cause discomfort. You make small talk.
What if he's a little shorter than you? Or left handed?
Perhaps he's not from your town, but from Depew, about twenty miles away. Probably nothing to consider…
What if he has shoulder-length red hair?
At some point, most people reach a moment of discomfort. What if he's 7 feet tall? Will you mention it? Or if he's under four feet? What if he's from a different country? Or a different race or speaking with a significant accent (or, more accurately, an accent that's different from yours)?
For as long as we've been keeping records, human beings have been on alert for the differences that divide us. Then we fixate on those differences, amplifying them, ascribing all sorts of irrelevant behaviors to them. Until, the next thing you know, we start referring to, ""those people.""
It seems as though it's a lot more productive to look for something in common. Attitudes and expectations. Beliefs in the common good and forward motion. A desire to make something that matters…

Ketchup and the third-party problem,"Sir Kensington’s Ketchup is better ketchup. Most adults who try it agree that it’s more delicious, a better choice. Alas, Heinz has a host of significant advantages, including dominant shelf space, a Proustian relationship with our childhood and unlimited money to spend on advertising.
The thing is, you can buy Sir Kensington’s any time you want to. And when you buy it, that’s what you get.
You’re not buying it to teach Heinz a lesson. You’re buying it because that’s the ketchup you want.
The marketing of Sir Kensington is simple: If you want better ketchup, buy this, you’ll get it.
Elections in the US don’t work this way.
I’m calling it a third-partyproblembecause the outcome of third-party efforts don’t align with the marketing (and work) that goes into them.
Ross Perot, the third-party candidate who ran against Bush and Clinton, cost Bush that election. The people who voted for Perot got Clinton, and it’s pretty clear that the Republicans learned nothing from this, as the next winning candidate they nominated was… George Bush.
Ralph Nader, the third-party candidate who ran against Bush and Gore, cost Gore that election. The people who voted for Nader got Bush, and it’s pretty clear that the Democrats learned nothing from this, as the next person they nominated was… John Kerry.
[Irrelevant aside: John Kerry was married to the heir of the Heinz Ketchup fortune.]
[I’m calling it a ‘problem’ because I have such huge respect for people who care enough and are passionate enough to support change. The problem is that since Gus Hall, and then John Anderson and then the more recent candidates, just about all the changes that third parties have tried to bring to national politics have foundered. It just isn’t a useful way to market change in this country.]
If enough people spent enough time, day after day, dollar after dollar, we could fundamentally alter the historic two-party system we have in the US. But it’s been shown, again and again, that the easy act of letting oneself off the hook by simply voting for a third-party candidate accomplishes nothing.
The marketing of the third-party candidate is: Teach those folks a lesson, plus, you’re not on the hook for what happens. But…
No one in government is learning a lesson.
And you don’t even get who you voted for.
The irony is not lost on me. A small group of voters who care a great deal are spending psychic energy on a vote that undermines the very change they seek to make.
It’s a self-defeating way of letting yourself off the hook, but of course, you’re actually putting yourself on the hook, just as you do if you don’t vote at all.
No candidate has earned a majority of all potential (regardless of registration) voters, not once in my lifetime. Which means that the people who don’t vote, or who vote for a third-party candidate, have an enormous amount of power. Which theywaste.
Yes, it’s on you. Your responsibility to vote for one of two people, and to be unhappy with that conundrum if you choose. And then work to change the system, and keep working at it…
But it’s not like ketchup. With ketchup, you get what you choose. With voting, we merely get the chance to do the best we can on one particular day, and then spend years working for what we might want.
It turns out that democracy involves a lot more than voting.","October 17, 2016","third-party problem, voting, democracy"
Corrosion,"The things that break all at once aren’t really a problem. You note that they’ve broken, and then you fix them.
The challenge is corrosion. Things that slowly fade, that eventually become a hassle–it takes effort and judgment to decide when it’s time to refurbish them.

Your discomfort zone,"Most of us need an external stimulus to do our best work.
It helps to have an alarm clock if you want to get out of bed before dawn.
A presentation. A deadline. A live performance. The threat of foreclosure, an upcoming review or some sort of crisis.
We can use these pressures to dig deeper, find new resources and overcome our self doubt.
The challenge is that sometimes, we pick the wrong stimulus. We choose a prompt to serve us, but we end up serving it, in a situation that hurts us (and others) instead of fueling the work.
It’s essential to realize that our discomfort zone is a choice, there isn’t a pre-ordained roster. If you need a deadline, for example, but have discovered that those deadlines are costing you money (because shortcuts are expensive), then it’s worth doing the hard work to find a new form of discomfort.
The problem with a drop-dead deadline is that if you miss it, you’re dead.
If you need to make huge promises and add all sorts of hype, but that hype is hurting your reputation, again, it’s worth investing in a new way to poke yourself to dig deeper.
When we hear about divas, or dysfunctional managers, more often than not we see a situation where someone who should know better has chosen the wrong form of discomfort.
The argument can be made that the biggest difference between a professional, an amateur and someone who’s not even participating is their choice of discomfort.
Give it a name, call it out. Your discomfort zone is a choice, and if it’s not serving you, fix it.
Like all tools, the right one serves the professional.","October 15, 2016","discomfort zone, external stimulus, self-doubt"

Cable news,"What if the fear and malaise and anger isn't merely being reported by cable news…
What if it's beingcausedby cable news?
What if ubiquitous video accompanied by frightening and freaked out talking heads is actually, finally, changing our culture?
Which came first, the news or the news cycle?
We seem to accept the hegemony of bottom-feeding media as some natural outgrowth of the world we live in. In fact, it's more likely an artifact of the post-spectrum cable news complex in which bleeding and leading became business goals.
There's always front page news because there's always a front page.
The world issafer(per capita) than ever before in recorded history. And people are more frightened. The rise of the media matches the rise of our fear.
Cable news isn't shy about stating their goals. The real question is: what'sourgoal? Every time we hook ourselves up to a device that shocks us into a fear-based posture on a regular basis, we're making a choice about the world and how we experience it.

He told me that this was a sweet spot, somewhere between amazing people with promises and disappointing them with reality.
That's one path.
The other path is the insurance company that points out that 99% of its customers would recommend them–afterfiling a claim. Imagine that standard: dealing with the emotions and financial impact of an insurance claim, knowing that you need to maintain a 99% delight standard.

Indomitable is a mirage,"One seductive brand position is the posture of being indomitable. Unable to be subdued, incapable of loss, the irresistible force and the immovable object, all in one.
The public enjoys rooting for this macho ideal. Superman in real life, but with the rage of a caged tiger. It is our avenger, a Jungian symbol come to life.
This isNorman Maileror Mike Tyson. It's Wells Fargo or VW.
There are problems.
First, it doesn't scale. When an indomitable brand or figure encounters an obstacle that can't be overcome, suddenly, the promise is hard to keep. And if the indomitable begins to succeed, he gets hungrier for the next conquest, making this failure inevitable.
Second, it's a bad strategy. In the long run, resilience always outperforms sheer strength. The instincts of the indomitable brand are to win every single battle, no matter how small. If you have armor, you will have chinks in that armor, and if those chinks distract or disable, the hero will stumble and eventually fall.
Mostly, though, the indomitable brand is self aware, and causes his own problems. The pressure is on for the next conquest, the next opponent to humiliate. The endless need for more people to bully, more opponents to vanquish, and more fights to pick (it's fuel) leads to drama, but not useful output.
If you must constantly create an 'other' to oppose, your tribe gets smaller.
If you can't say, ""I made a mistake,"" then it's incredibly difficult to lead. You end up managing instead, picking small fights, skirting the rules and blaming the ref.

Unweasonable,"Weasel words damage trust. And weasels are worth avoiding.
There are two traps to look out for:
Promotional weasel words. Every experienced marketing copywriter knows how to use them. ""As much as half off,"" means, ""There is at least one item on sale for half of some price of dubious origin. Everything else is any price we want it to be.""
When you say, ""nearly 500,"" it's a totally different message than, ""500.""
Words like, ""renowned,"" ""fabled,"" and ""deluxe"" are weasely. They let you wriggle out of your promise.
Resumes are a natural habitat for weasel words, fyi.
You can ban the weasel words if you like. It takes a leap of courage, and then things get easier.
The other kind:
When you try to enter into an agreement with a weasel, you'll need to over-lawyer and over-document every element of your interaction, because he'll be working overtime to rewrite, redefine and generally squirm out of what he said, what he promised and what you expect.
If you can, don't work with weasels.
First step: don't be one.

The FLASH drives,"Fear, loneliness, anger, shame & hunger.
They drive us. They divide us. They take us away from our work, our mission, our ability to make a difference. And yet, sometimes, they fuel our motion, leading to growth and connection.
When a variety of FLASH shows up, it almost never calls itself by name. Instead, it lashes out. It criticizes what we’ve made or done. And mostly, it hides behind words, argument and actions, instead of revealing itself.
As you’ve guessed, correcting the false argument is futile. Logic doesn’t work either. You can’t reason with FLASH because it is, by definition, unreasonable.
Worth repeating that: We’re rarely reasonable. Most of the time, we’re afraid, lonely, angry, shameful or hungry.
Sometimes, we can address those emotions by seeing that reason can help our problem, but mostly, we start and end with the emotion.
Recognize it.
Pause to allow it be seen and heard.
And then, if we’re willing, we can dance with it. We can put the arguments aside, the demands and the expectations and sit with the emotion. Not get defensive, because the emotion isn’t about us or our work at all.
Then, maybe, we can begin to bring civilization back into the conversation, the story of us, the opportunity for growth and connection, and ultimately, the power of thought and reason and forward motion.","November 29, 2016","Emotions, Growth, Connection"

We always think about the cost of an item before we buy it, but we don't buy it because of what it costs.
If you find yourself acting like you sell a commodity, saying, ""this is category X and the price is Y"" then you've ceased doing any sort of marketing. You're a commodity provider by choice, which is fine as long as you're okay with competing in a race to the bottom.
The alternative is to do the difficult and risky work of earning attention, earning a reputation and mostly telling a story that takes your product or service out of the commodity category and into a space defined by connection, meaning and possibility instead.

[Some readers were curious about the ""Wheeler which."" Elmer Wheeler was a sales trainer nearly a century ago. He got hired by a chain of drugstores to increase sales at the soda fountain. In those days, a meal might consist of just an ice cream soda for a nickel. But for an extra penny or two, you could add a raw egg (protein!). Obviously, if more people added an egg, profits would go up. Wheeler taught the jerks (isn't that a great job title?) to ask anyone who ordered a soda, ""One egg or two?"" Sales of the egg add-on skyrocketed.]","November 27, 2016","decision-making, choices, Occam's razor"
On demand vs. in stock,"""You can have any color car you want as long as it's black.""
Henry Ford made cars in black because black paint dried four hours faster than any other color. That fast drying meant that the line worked faster, which made them cheaper. Just as important, he didn't have stockouts–with only one color, the color you wanted was the color he had.
Ever since then, there's been a move to on-demand, built to order and custom work. In everything we do. Freelance work, shoes, baked goods, kitchen cabinets, software, travel plans. And it seems like a cost-free progression. The thing is, it's not.
Most of the cost of everything we buy is in the risk, the starting, the stopping, the waste, the breakage, the planning.
A pair of mass produced shoes can be made for $3. A pair of custom shoes might cost $200 once you count all the associated costs.
McDonald's hit a peak moment of productivity by getting to a mythical scale, with a limited menu and little in the way of customization. They could deliver a burger for a fraction of what it might take a diner to do it on demand.
McDonald's now challenges the idea that custom has to cost more, because they've invested in mass customization.
Things that are made on demand by algorithmic systems and robots cost more to set up, but once they do, the magic is that the incremental cost of one more unit is really low. If you're organized to be in the mass customization business, then the wind of custom everything is at your back.
The future clearly belongs to these mass customization opportunities, situations where there is little cost associated with stop and start, little risk of not meeting expectations, where a robot and software are happily shifting gears all day long.
But if you're not set up for this, if you're hustling your coders or your production line or your painters or whomever to go faster and cheaper, you're fighting the wrong side of the productivity curve. It's like the diner that sought to be a friendly, custom-order place but also promised to be as cheap or as profitable as a fast food place.
These traditional businesses, the small ones, the non-automated ones, can sell custom, sure, but not at the price they used to sell the thing they make in bulk. And too often, organizations undercharge for the custom work and find themselves trapped between the productivity of doing things in batches and the challenge of delighting each customer, who carries his or her own dreams of what perfect looks like.","November 26, 2016","mass customization, on-demand, productivity"

The powerful seduction of ‘powerless’,"Where do conspiracy theories come from?
More than 10% of the population still believes that the moon landings werefaked. (Even though we can see the landing modules with a telescope).
People make up inane theories about various cabals that are secretly controlling this or that.
In fact, the more information and leverage we each have, the more inclined the culture seems to embrace stories of puppetry, conspiracy and control.
Because it lets us off the hook.
How can you possibly be responsible if there are powerful shady forces working behind the scenes? If you're powerless, it also means you're not at fault if things don't get better.
[Of course, the world isn't fair, and there are people, powerful people, working against you. The best systems open doors, not close them. The best systems work for us, not against us. But that doesn't mean we're powerless, it only means that we have to work ever harder. Harder on the system and harder around it.]
She's beenquoteda million times, but people don't really listen to the essence of Marianne Williamson's quote: ""Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.""
If we're actually powerful, if our voice, our effort and our contribution matter, it's time to get to work.
This is enervating. It would be so much more comforting if it were up to someone else. Whatever system we are living in or with, it would be nice if it were responsible for what happens next.
On the other hand, knowing that we can connect, publish, inspire, lead, build, describe, invent, encourage and (especially) teach, means that there's no one better than us and no time like right now.
And if it helps, go find, organize and connect with others who feel as committed as you do.

The memories we rehearse are the ones we live with,"A million things happened to you today. The second bite of your lunch. The red light on the third block of your commute…
Tomorrow, you’ll remember almost none of them.
And the concept that you’d remember something that happened to you when you were twelve is ludicrous.
What actually happened was this: After it (whatever that thing you remember) happened, you started telling yourself a story about that event. You began to develop a narrative about this turning point, about the relationship with your dad or with school or with cars.
Lots of people have had similar experiences, but none of them are telling themselves quite the same story about it as you are.
Over time, the story is rehearsed. Over time, the story becomes completely different from what a videotape would show us, but it doesn’t matter, because the rehearsed story is far more vivid than the video ever could be.
And so the story becomes our memory, the story gets rehearsed ever more, and the story becomes the thing we tell ourselves the next time we need to make a choice.

"It’s not the bottom, it’s the foundation","Organizations are built on the work of people who don’t get paid very much, don’t receive sufficient respect and are understandably wary of the promises they’ve been hearing for years.
Calling these folks the bottom of the org chart doesn’t help.
Imagine that throughout your career you were paid as little as legally possible, the last to be hired and the first to be laid off. Imagine that the boss gets more vacation days, doesn’t have to clock in and out, and is actually given control over how he spends his time.
Why is it surprising to bosses, then, that some workers respond to this arrangement by doing as little work as possible?
Here’s the thing: people actually want to do a good job. They want to be proud of their work, they appreciate being engaged, they thrive when they have some measure of control over their day.
Too often, though, the optimistic leader meets the pessimistic front line and distrust undermines all the good intent. The boss loses patience and reverts to the test-and-measure, trust-no-one, scientific-management tradition of dehumanizing the very humans who make the whole project work.
And so, back to being mediocre. Back to high turnover, low trust, no care. Back to workers who don’t believe and bosses who are now cynics.
Mostly, back to an ordinary organization that’s like so many others.
There’s an alternative. But it’s a process, not an event.
Step 1: A commitment, from the top, that this place is going to be different.The commitment is open-ended. It involves leading and showing up and keeping promises, for months and years into the future. It’s non-cynical, and it views leadership as an opportunity, the possibility of serving customers at the very same time you inspire and enable employees.
This is going to take a long time, and it’s not going to be the cheapest path. It turns out, though, in industries where people matter (which is more and more of the work we do) that this path pays for itself eventually.
Step 2: Hire for attitude, not for learned skills.You can teach someone to do just about anything. It’s far more difficult to build an instinct to care. When you hire trustworthy people who are willing to trust you, you have an opportunity to build trust, which enables communication, which allows you to teach, which upgrades everything.
If you are in a hurry to assemble a group of people who can ‘do the work’, you will end up with folks who merely needed a job. On the other hand, if you are willing to invest in people who are enrolled in the journey you’re on, you will end up with a team.
[Corollary: Fire for attitude, fix for skills. The attitudes you put up with will become the attitudes of your entire organization. Over time, every organization becomes what is tolerated]
Step 3: Be clear in actions and words about what’s important.It doesn’t do any good to hire for attitude but only reward for short-term results. If you reward a cynic merely because he got something done, you’ve made it clear to everyone else that cynicism is okay. If you overlook the person who is hiding mistakes because his productivity is high, then you are rewarding obfuscation and stealth.
Who gets the employee of the month parking space? Who gets laid off?
People are watching you.They’re not listening to your words as much as they’re seeking to understand where the boundaries and the guard rails lie, because they’ve learned from experience that people who do what gets rewarded, get rewarded.
Hint: if you tell people something is important but fail to give them the tools and the support and the training that they need to do that important thing, you’ve just told them that it’s not actually important.
Step 4: Be clear and consistent about how we do things around here. It’s going to be a long time before people act like they own the place. After all, you own the place and you don’t even act like you do most of the time.
This job is important. It feeds my family. It pays the rent. It’s connected to my self-esteem. I will act in the interest of my family, not your invisible shareholders.
Step 5: Your problem is not their problem.The people who build the foundation of your business have plenty of things to worry about. Your narrative about your day is not one of them.
Over time, it’s reasonable to expect that an engaged and respectful working environment will lead to ever more big-picture thinking. But it’s naïve and self-defeating to expect a 20-year-old who’s been on the job for a week to make a connection between the customer who just walked in, your big wholesale account, the loan that’s due soon and the espresso he just pulled.
Every day, you’re going to be tested on these five principles. Every day, there’s going to be a moment of urgency, a shortcut presented, a confusion. And in that moment, the first principle is going to come into question.
But this is the foundation, it’s not the bottom. This is the source for all your possibility, for the change you seek to make.

New: A master class in value creation,"I've just created an intensive video course designed to help you think differently about what you make and why.
It's for marketers, founders, freelancers, fundraisers, teachers and change agents that understand that nothing works unless it works for your audience.
Intensive? Yes because unlike most video courses, you're supposed to do more than watch it. It contains just over 40 minutes of video broken into short chapters. It also comes with a workbook that's 30 pages long. Print out the workbook, watch the video, fill in the workbook, go over it with others in the Udemy community, print the workbook out again, watch the video again, go over the workbook with your team. Like most things, more input gets you more output.
From a recent review: ""… approaches the problem of value creation in such a new way that I've already had many 'aha'-moments. And I'm only partway through the course!""
If you do the work, you'll start to see things differently.
The course is $95, but blog readers doing important work can get it for half price by using thislink.
It comes with a money-back guarantee and I hope you will check out a few of the lessons before you enroll.

Empathy is a bridge,"""Sorry"" doesn't mean you caused the pain. It merely means that you see it, that you've felt pain before in your life as well, that you are open to a connection.
Our ability to bring people along is critical because we're playing a long game, even an infinite one. Back and forth, day by day, with many of the same people. One day, it will be reversed, and a classmate or co-worker or competitor will be the one that can listen and care about the pain. A pain that might feel very similar.
Gloating or silence closes the door. Empathy, on the other hand, and the action of speech, of moderation, of connection, can change everything. And if it hasn't been present before, it can start right now.

Education is the answer,"It almost doesn't matter what the question is, really.
Everyone is an independent actor, now more than ever, with access to information, to tools, to the leverage to make a difference.
Instead of being a cog merely waiting for instructions, we get to make decisions and take action based on what we know and what we believe.
Change what you know, change what you believe, and you change the actions. Learn to see, to understand, to have patience, and you learn to be the kind of person who can make a difference.
Formal education is a foundation, but lifelong, informal education can transform our lives.
And informal education scales. It spreads more easily than ever before. Educated people create other educated people. The standards go up when education is present, because the cost of being the least educated person in your tribe is high.
Ignorance, on the other hand, can spread as well. When the cultural dynamic in your circle is that ignorance is prized, it will pull others down and lead to more ignorance.
We can learn techniques, sure, but also empathy, curiosity and patience.
Arguing is futile, because arguing presumes that we can use force of will to change minds. And force begets force. Education, on the other hand, involves enrollment, and volunteers in search of answers can learn quickly.
The path forward, it seems, is to connect. To earn enrollment in having others join you in a journey of education. If you can teach something, find someone who will benefit and teach them. And if you can connect and make education accessible, it creates a new standard for the people you care about.

Some people, when confronted with an artificial problem like this, simply throw up their hands. It's a trick, it's a waste of time, there's really no value in it.
Some people look for the quick insight, the fact that there's an irrational number, that the string doesn't go on forever, etc. But they usually get stuck.
Some people are only interested in the answer, and are eager to argue that it should be zero, not four, while others would point out that zero isn't necessarily a natural number, and on and on, merely as a way from hiding from the entire point of the lesson.
The real lesson happens once we realize the metaphor that's available to each of us: Things don't need to be artificial to be puzzles. In fact, if you're willing to be disappointed in your search for the right answer, just about every situation is a puzzle, a place where an insight might be found.
Artificial puzzles like this one generally guarantee a right answer exists. The challenge of the natural puzzle is that you eagerly accept that maybe, there's no good solution.

How they talk you out of voting,"The easiest way to win an election is to get the people who might vote for your opponent to not vote.
TV has proven an effective engine behind this strategy, and thegrowthin voter turnout has slowed since campaigns began running significant TV campaigns 50 years ago. [This year's turnout was the lowest since 2000].
It works because it's not that difficult to talk someone out of voting.
The two most common unstated reasons for not voting are:
""I don't want to vote for the person who loses, because I'll feel badly having wasted my vote and being associated with the unpopular outcome.""
""I don't want to vote for the person who wins, because then I'll be partly responsible for whatever happens.""
A popular rationale to justify either of these reasons is:
""I don't like either candidate, they're both terrible.""
The thing is,there has never been a perfect leader. There has never been a flawless president. There are always weaknesses, foibles and scandals. It takes more than a hundred years before the patina sets in, and even then, most great leaders throughout history had defects that would cause them to wither under today's profit-minded, scandal-focused media.
Same thing for the charities we donate to (or don't), the heroes and mentors we revere, the organizations we're proud to be a part of.
Change is always rough around the edges. It has no right answers, no ideal keys that unlock the future. But risky schemes are always risky.
The media, with our complicity, has created a game where we end up disillusioned and disgusted. But it's only the disillusioned and the disgusted voters who are capable of raising the bar in the long run.
Vote as if you're responsible, because you are, especially if you don't vote.

Confusion about scale—more people and more money isn’t always the same as more pressure,"Ignore sunk costs:One of the most popular book Kickstarters ever was a project to publish a new, attractive version of the Bible. It raised more than $1.2 million. In thisvideo, released shortly after the books were finally printed, we learn a lot about sunk costs. The first: It’s a fallacy to decide that merely because more people are buying something that it’s now a more important project.The joy you will create per person doesn't change when you have more readers.
Not only that, but given the efficient nature of book printing, more books printed shouldn’t lead to a two-year delay in the project.
Second, and far more useful, is understanding that real artists ship. In this case, the creator of the project spent every penny available to overengineer and procrastinate. My guess is that he would have gone right to the limit with $500,000 and with $5,000,000. The amount of money you have to spend should have nothing to do with how you spend it. Worth re-reading that sentence. Budgets exist to help us make plans, not because the problem we seek to solve is related to the money. It's not. It's related to the expectation of our customer.
Once the theater is big enough that you can't see the folks in the back row, it doesn't matter how big the theater is.
In this case, as in so many others, the real question is: What is it for?
What is the project for? What did the backers buy? When is it time to ship?
When making decisions, we need to drop much of the traditional narrative and get back to a very simple analysis:
At this fork in the road, what are our options?
Given the promise we've made and the resources we have to keep that promise, what's the best option?
Do that.
Do it regardless of how much it cost to get here, regardless of how nervous you are, regardless of how hard you worked on the other option. Those aren't factors in making a rational decision.","November 4, 2016","sunk costs, project management, decision-making"
And when it breaks?,"Every website your organization puts up is going to reach a moment when it is obsolete, out of date or buggy.
How will you know?
And what will you do about it?
Big organizations have this problem every day. When building a website, the hierarchy pays attention. There are meetings and approvals, and it all fits together in the current strategy.
But a year or a decade later, those folks have moved on, but the website remains. And it's unlikely that there's someone checking it for bad behavior.
So there's the Fedex database that sends customers to a drop box that doesn't accept packages any longer. Or the part of the Brother website that requires users to change their password every single time they visit. I'm sure I have pages out there on the web that are out of date or buggy as well. It's inevitable.

Plenty of room on the island,"Have you noticed that authors often happily recommend books by other authors (even though an MBA might call them competitors)?
Not only that, but books sell best in the bookstore, right next to the other books.
It would be a stunning surprise if Tim Cook wrote a blurb for a Samsung phone. They live in a zero-sum universe, assuming that everyone is likely to only buy one or the other.
But for the rest of us, in most industries, it turns out that the real competition isinaction. Few markets have expanded to include everyone, and most of those markets (like books and music) have offerings where people buy more than one.
This means that if there’s more good stuff, more people enter the market, the culture gets better, more good work is produced and enjoyed, more people enter the market, and on and on.

The wrong side of history,"Racist and sexist verbal attacks ('remarks' is too mild) never make sense.
Over time, people who judge others by their origin or chromosomes are always proved wrong, always shown to be afraid, not wise.
The fear that provokes these attacks takes many forms, it doesn't discriminate based on the bigot's age or income or even race or gender. But the fear is real, and when the fear pushes people to demean others, it's revealing itself.
Even though the fear is real, it's not an excuse. When we speak with respect and offer dignity and empathy, we're describing our future. 'Politically correct' is a cheap way of dismissing maturity, confidence and kindness. Calling angry words a joke, or a momentary slip can't hide them.

No one knows anything,"About twenty years ago,Permission Marketingwas getting ready to go to the publisher. We sent a copy to Jack Trout, co-author of the classic book,Positioning.
Surprisingly, Jack replied with a long letter, letting us know that my book was based on a fundamentally flawed idea, that it would never work and we’d be better off not even publishing it. Not something most authors want to hear.
The good news was that the book went on to become a bestseller and, even better, it transformed the way many organizations engaged with email and with consumers. It led to a market that’s now worth billions of dollars a year.
The lesson from Jack’s note was simple: Since no one is sure, since no one can guarantee that it’s going to work (or not), all we can do is our best work. All we can do is share our ideas with generosity, speak up and shine a light.
Critics can share their experience and they can point out what doesn’t match their expectations.

We are all biased,"That airline is biased in favor of pilots with many hours of experience.
Is it possible that a newbie pilot might be safer flying this jet than someone with twenty years of daily flying? Perhaps. But it's not worth the time, the money and the risk to find out. That's why you won't see a new pilot flying the 747 you're boarding. Young pilots have to put in a ton of hours because the airlines are biased.
Everyone has a bias, because that's the only way to survive in a world where we have insufficient information.
Bank security guards are biased against people who walk into the bank wearing a ski mask. It might be because it's cold outside, but it helps them do their job to begin each interaction with this belief.
Engineers are biased for certain suppliers or technologies. Talent bookers are biased for certain skills and demeanors.
The problem kicks in when our bias works against our goals. When our bias keeps us from exploring options that will move us forward, it needs to be replaced. When our bias cripples a society we care about, when it gets in the way of fairness, it must be re-examined.
But it's worth understanding the nuance between the bias that enables us to be successful and the one that keeps us from that very same outcome.

Omotenashi and the service split,"It is possible to deliver amazing service without being servile.
Omotenashiis the Japanese word for treating people the way you'd want to be treated, for a posture of customer service that builds long-term trust and loyalty.
Why the split?
In a self-service world, the person who provides the service is us. We get what we want precisely because the system has been built to make us our own provider of service. This is why most people would rather order from a menu, pick our own travel itinerary or brush our own teeth.
When done right, self-service is a great option to offer customers. When done to merely cut costs, or when done with a poor understanding of the user, it's mostly annoying.
The alternative, then, is to provide actual customer delight via service. To bring Omotenashi to the table,to offer human service that's even better than the customer could provide for herself.
One way to think about this is to consider the airlines. In almost everything they do, the airline experience today is inferior to what it was on Pan Am in 1972. Every time the airline gets involved, their efforts to cut costs exceed their commitment to service.
On the other hand, in the ways that the airlines have given passengers control of their choices (seeing available flights, for example, or choosing their own onboard pasttime), satisfaction has had a chance to increase.
If you're going to do it for us, do it beautifully.","December 15, 2016","Omotenashi, customer service, self-service"

When your marketplace shifts,"It might happen to you.
Many markets have a base (people seeking a solution), a middle (people seeking some originality, something new, something a little better) and a top (educated and passionate consumers willing to go extra miles to get something special).
Here's what happens (imagine travel agents, for example, or the farmers' markets in France):
A. a disruption happens to the marketplace, instantly sucking the base out of the market. When was the last time you called a travel agent? Or, in the case of France, the hypermarche destroyed the need to wait for the weekly market to get some eggs and some carrots.
B. without a base, merchants have to struggle to attract enough business to stick around and to invest in getting better. Many of these merchants either don't have the skills, the resources or the good taste to build a business without the base. They slowly, and painfully, disappear.
C. A few flee to the top. These are the folks with great heirloom tomatoes for sale, or the ones who specialize in high-end cruises or adventure travel. But it's tough going, because without the base and the middle, every sale is on a knife's edge, every customer realizes how much power she has.
The marketplace disruption puts huge pressure on any merchant who merely created a commodity. This means vineyards, graphic designers, photographers, etc.
When you see it coming, there are only two choices:
Run like hell to a new market, or,
Move up, faster and more boldly than anyone thinks is rational.","December 13, 2016","marketplace disruption, consumer behavior, business adaptation"
Two quality spirals worth avoiding,"The downward quality spiral: You cut some corners, saving some time and some money.
For a little while, you can coast on that.
But then demand goes down, you can't get the same pricing, there's less money, which means you can't invest, which means quality goes down again, and again, and then you lose.
Or, consider the other direction:
You improve what you make, you invest the time and effort and resources and you make the best thing you can imagine.
The crowd goes wild, you get more invitations, more revenue, more opportunities.
And then you exceed expectations again.
It's great, until. Until you become paralyzed. Until you decide (mistakenly) that you are in the exceeding expectations business. That can't possibly scale forever. So you stop.
And then we all lose.
Seeing a spiral coming is the key step in avoiding it.
The productive professional realizes that keeping promises is often enough. Randomly exceeding those promises is magical. But the key is 'randomly'. Unexpected delight is priceless, and something you can deliver on.
We need you to keep showing up.

We call someone pushy when they are trying harder for forward motion than we are. We call them pushy when they have more at stake, or more to gain, than we think we do.
It's easy to rationalize your pushiness, imagining that the other person really wants to do this project. And it's just as easy to minimize the value you add, hiding in a corner instead of bringing your value forward.

"Understanding the backlist (for everything, including books)","It really ought to be called thecore list, because it's fundamentally misunderstood as something in the background, an afterthought.
The backlist is the stuff you sell long after you've forgotten all the drama that went into making it.
Book publishers make more than 90% of their profit from books they published more than six months ago. And yet they put 2% of their effort into promoting and selling those books. Editors, agents, salespeople all focus on what's new, instead of what works.
It's more exciting, more fun and more hopeful to seek out and launch new books. It's the culture of many industries, particularly ones that are seen as creative.
Nike and General Mills and the local freelancer all generate a bigger contribution with their classic stuff.
It turns out that time spent on packaging, promoting and spreading the ideas in the core list is almost always a solid investment.
There's a simple explanation:
Successfulbacklistproducts have crossed thechasmand are selling to the mass market, the largest chunk of any market. These are people who don't buy a lot of books (or sneakers, or cereals) a year, but when they do buy one, they buy a popular one. And so, every year, year after year, millions of copies of Dr. Seuss books are sold. Not because they're new, but because that's what people buy.
On the other hand, frontlist products, the new stuff, are bought by a smaller group, the early adopters, the people who like buying new books. These people are easier to reach, probably more fun to work with, but because they seek variety, they rarely all align and buy the same product.
[FWIW, the readers of this blog and followers of my work are almost all in this category–focusing on early adopters is a fine way to build a platform for work you care about—it's something that I do on purpose. But it doesn't always make economic sense.]
The way for an enterprise to build a core list, then, is to latch onto those frontlist titles that have proven themselves, to persistently and consistently work with the retail channel and the existing customer base to make them into classics—useful, reliable products or services that the masses can rely on.
This takes discipline and effort—product creators like me find this difficult. But publishers of all stripes, the organizations that exist to bring new ideas and useful technologies to the world, need to dig in and do this work.

You can’t stand for everything.
“Anyone can be our customer and we will get you what you want…” is almost impossible to pull off. So is, “we are the cheapest and the most convenient and the best.”

Which kind of truth?,"Organic chemistry doesn't care if you believe in it. Neither does the War of 1812.
Truth is real, it's measurable and it happened. Truth is not in the eye of the beholder.
There are facts that don't change if the observer doesn't believe: The age of the Eiffel Tower. The temperature in Death Valley. The number of people in the elevator.
On the other hand, there are outcomes that vary quite a bit if we believe: The results of the next sales call. Our response to medical treatment. The enjoyment of music…
If you believe that this wine tastes better than that one, it probably will. If you believe you're going to have a great day at work, it will surely help.Placeboswork.
We make two mistakes, all the time. First, we believe that some things are facts (as in true), when in fact, belief has a huge effect on what's going to happen. In the contest between nature and nurture, nurture has far more power than we give it credit for. In countless ways, our friends and parents matter more than our genes do.
At the same time, sometimes we get carried away. We work to amplify our beliefs by willfully confusing ourselves about whether the truth is flexible. It makes belief a lot more compelling (but a lot less useful) if we start to confuse it with truth.
But belief is too important and too powerful to be a suspect compatriot of the scientific/historical sort of truth.
We can believe because it gives us joy and strength and the ability to do amazing things. That's enough.","December 1, 2016","truth, belief, perception"
Missed it by that much,"I got to the gate just as they closed the door and the plane began to back away.
It was thirty years ago, but I still remember how it felt. I think we’re hard-wired to fear these painful moments of missing out.
Deadlines don’t cause death if missed, but sometimes we persuade ourselves that it’s almost as bad. As a result, marketers and others that want us to take action invent cliffs, slamming doors and loud buzzers.
We put a rope at door, a timer on the clock and focus on scarcity and the fear of missing out. And as a result, consumers and students and co-workers wait for the signals, prioritizing their lives around the next urgency.
When everything is focused on the deadline, there’s little time to work on the things that are actually important.
When we build our lives around ‘what’s due’ we sacrifice our agency to the priorities and urgencies of everyone else.
More important is the bigger issue:Time is running out.
For all the things you might want to experience, not merely the ones that are about to leave the gate.
Time is running out for you to level up or connect or to be generous to someone who really needs you.
Time is running out for you to become the person you've decided to be, to make the difference you seek to make, to produce the work you know you're capable of.

Make believe problems,"We focus on them and elevate them on our priority list.
Sometimes, we invent a fake problem and give it great import and urgency as a way to take our focus and fear away from the thing that's actually a threat. These fake problems have no apparent solution, but at least they give us something to fret over, a way to distract ourselves and the people around us.
And sometimes, we pick a fake problem that has a convenient and easy fake solution. Because, the thinking goes, we're taking action, so things must be getting better.

But often, what we want is traction. The traction to find our footing, shift our posture, make a new decision. The traction to actually influence what happens next, not merely slip our way toward a goal of someone else's choosing.","January 29, 2017","Friction, Traction, User Engagement"
Just the right amount of data,"The digital sign at the train station near my home could show me what time it is.
It could tell us how many more minutes until the next train.
Or it could announce if the train was running on time…
Instead, it shows me today's date.
What am I supposed to do with that data?
Or consider the typical hotel bathroom scale. Accurate to plus or minus five pounds, it's worthless, because it doesn't help the user know how much weight has been gained (or lost).
In this case, the absolute number doesn't matter, it's the trend over time.

"Shared reality, diverse opinions","We're not having a lot of trouble with the ""diverse opinions"" part.
But they're worthless without shared reality.
At a chess tournament, when the newcomer tries to move his rook diagonally, it's not permitted. ""Hey, that's just your opinion,"" is not a useful response. Because, after all, chess is defined by the rules of the game. If you want to play a different game, begin by getting people to agree to the new rules.
In physics, it doesn't matter how much you want a ping pong ball to accelerate faster, your opinion isn't going to change what happens.
It's tempting to race right into our plans to solve a problem, but too often, we wrap our version of reality tightly into that proposed solution, without thoughtfully getting buy in on the reality before launching into the solution we're so eager to describe.
Shared reality is the foundation on which we can build trust, make promises and engage in a useful discussion on how to achieve our goals.","January 27, 2017","shared reality, diverse opinions, trust"
Appropriate complexity and risk,"The best time to experiment in the kitchen is if you don't have 11 guests coming for dinner in three hours.
Or, at the very least, be sure to have some decent frozen pizzas on hand, just in case.
We often sign ourselves up for long, involved entanglements, and a good thing, too, because they can enable us to produce real value.
But our promises matter, and there's no need to raise the stakes at the same time that we're figuring things out.

A listening device,"Jacqueline Novogratz points out that the market can be an efficient listening device. If you go to a person and offer charity or even a gift, there's not a lot of choice. But if you offer to sell someone something, you'll hear very clearly what's wrong with it, whether it's worth it, and how it can be improved. The transaction engages both sides in a discussion, and sometimes, the market causes the supplier to listen. Co-creation over time transforms problems into opportunities.
In fact, this is the single best explanation for why markets work. Voluntary engagement and the exchange of resources can solve many problems, particularly if coercion is avoided.
As soon as an organization achieves significant market power, though, it's tempting for it to not listen any longer. Coercion and market power feel more efficient than engaging and leading. Applestoppedlistening to its biggest fans and focuses on the stock price instead. Companies with near monopolies (like telecommunications, Google, Fedex, etc.) begin to lose the listening skills they'd developed and instead respond by expressing theirpower. Extraction companies focus on lobbying instead of innovating.
This willful ignorance and lack of engagement can last a long time, but it never lasts forever. Someone who listens better eventually shows up and changes the game.
If you hold the small end of a megaphone up to your ear, it acts as an amplifier, helping you listen more carefully.
And if you want to be heard, you can move it to your mouth and share your ideas. Persistently, consistently and often.
The best way to complain is to make something.  The second best way is to say something.  And if you can organize others to say it with you, even better.","January 25, 2017","Listening, Market Power, Co-creation"
Hoarding doesn’t work,"There's a contradiction built into our instinct to hoard: the more we do it, the less we get.
An idea shared is worth more than one kept hidden. Opportunities passed from one to another create connections which lead to more opportunities. Opened doors lead to forward motion.
Winning doesn't usually involve demolishing the opposition. Instead, for most of us, it's about weaving. A scientist without peers won't find a breakthrough anytime soon. A bookstore with one book won't work. A market with only one vendor will fail. And if you're the only cello player in town, your craft will disappear. Trust and connection and utilization support forward motion.
The primary driver of our well-being is our culture. A culture built on selfishness is harsh, brittle and short-lived.
We're notpayingthings forward. We're launching them forward, and it will boomerang back to us, eventually, somehow, in some form, if we do it often enough and with enough generosity.","January 24, 2017","Hoarding, Connection, Generosity"
Almost no one,"We may dream of the mass market, but the mass market doesn't dream of us.
Almost no one visits your restaurant, almost no one buys your bestselling book, almost no one watches the Tonight Show.
Rare indeed is a market where everyone is active.
We think we're designing and selling to everyone, but that doesn't match reality. It makes no sense at all to dumb down your best work to appeal to the longtime bystander, because the bystander isn't interested. And it certainly makes no sense to try to convert your biggest critics, because they've got a lot at stake in their role of being your critic.
Growth comes from person-to-person communication, from the powerful standards of 'people like us'. And it comes from activating people who are ready to be activated.

Long-term strategy: Don’t be a jerk,"In the moment, when you have power, no matter how momentarily, how will you choose to act?
Jerkcomes from the idea of pulling hard on the reins, suddenly and without care. Horses don't like it and neither, it turns out, do people.
More than just about anything else, what you do when you have the chance is what people say about you and remember about you. The community pays careful attention to the restraint (or lack of it) that you show when the opportunity arises.
Whether you're a parent or a multinational, in the long run, the wheel is going to turn. It might be a minute, a day or a week, but your power is unlikely to last.
When we assume that everyone is a volunteer and that all power is transient, it's easier to become the person we're proud to be.
This is the essence of marketing–acting in the way you'd like to be seen and understood. Especially when you have the power to make choices.","January 22, 2017","Power, Restraint, Community"
You can look it up,"Of course, for millions of years, people couldn't look it up. They couldn't read and they hadn't invented writing yet, so there was nothing to look up.
All you knew was what you knew, along with what you could ask someone about.
""Uncle Rock told me that the bark from this tree will help a headache.""
With writing came notes, records and books. And with a great deal of training and effort, there were things that you could look up. This is an unsung moment in human history, because it allowed knowledge to begin to compile, and enabled all sorts of longer-term transactions (including debt instruments).
In the mechanical age of a hundred years ago, we got better and better at doing this at scale. Now there were millions of books, and card catalogs. But looking up most things was time consuming and often came up empty (as recently as twenty years ago, the only way to find something in a book was via an index, which certainly gave hints, but it lived only in the book itself).
The current era of on-demand, widespread looking things up offers a whole new level of insight for those that care enough to take advantage of it. Unfortunately, most people don't.
Most organizations, most leaders, most scientists, most doctors… hesitate to look it up. We're not sure exactly what to look up, not sure of what we don't know, not sure of what might be out there. It still takes talent and time to find the right thing in the right place at the right time.
The next frontier is already starting to happen. The system looks it up before we even realize it needs looking up. The system tells us that this resume comes with an anti-social online record attached to it. The system knows that these test results combined with that medical history is worth a deeper look. The system knows that this house was recently sold for a fraction of what's being asked…

Rights aren't a decision we make when we're in the mood or it's easy. They're the bedrock of our culture, our economy and our way of life.
Of course, they're inconvenient sometimes. That's precisely why we have to work so hard to defend them.

How long is now?,"Yes, that dog is moving, but not that tree. Plants don't move.
Well, yes, they actually do. Trees grow and then they decay. It's just that we can't see it happening now. It happens over a longer span. Which means itishappening now, just not in a way that matches our frame.
Getting our time scale right is essential. It affects how we perceive the growth of our organization, or the changes in our planet. It changes the way we invest in education and how we react or respond to the news media.
Do we need a sweep second hand on our wrist watch or merely a page-a-day calendar to mark the passage of time?
Alan Burdick's newbookgoes into the history of how we think about now (as compared to before and after) and one particular example stuck with me: What would happen if we were creatures that lived for only 28 days? Or for 300,000 days? And if our attention span compressed or expanded along with that outcome?
Often, people who are happier or more effective than we are are merely seeing things in a different (and more appropriate) time window.
And one last example, I'll call itDash'sTwitch: It turns out that the insanely stressfultickerthat the New York Times had on their home page on election night, the one that kept flicking back and forth, taunting everyone who saw it, was actually using ""real-time"" data that only updated a few times a minute.
Which means that the twitch was faked. Yes, the data was moving over time, but it wasn't movingnow.
If our now gets short enough, everything is a twitch.
And twitches, while engaging, aren't particularly useful or productive.","January 18, 2017","Time perception, growth, attention span"
Economics is messy,"We still teach a lot of myths in the intro to economics course, myths that spill over to conventional wisdom.
Human beings make rational decisions in our considered long-term best interest.
Actually, behavioral economics shows us that people almost never do this. Our decision-making systems are unpredictable, buggy and often wrong. We are easily distracted, and even more easily conned.
Every time we assume that people are profit-seeking, independent, rational actors, we've made a mistake.
The free market is free.
The free market only works because it has boundaries, rules and methods of enforcement. Value is created by increasing information flow and working to have as many contributing citizens as possible.
Profit is a good way to demonstrate the creation of value.
In fact, it's a pretty lousy method. The local water company clearly creates more value (in the sense that we can't live without it) than the handbag store down the street, and yet the handbag store has a much higher profit margin. That's not because of value, but because of mismatches in supply and demand, or less relevant inputs like brand, market power and corporate structure.
Profit is often a measure of short-term imbalances or pricing power, not value.
I hope we can agree that a caring nurse in the pediatric oncology ward adds more value than a well-paid cosmetic plastic surgeon doing augmentations. People with more money might pay more, but that doesn't equate to value.
The best way to measure value created is to measure value, not profit.
The purpose of society is to maximize profit
Well, since profit isn't a good measure of value created, this isn't at all consistent. More important, things like a living wage, sustainability, fairness and the creation of meaning matter even more. When we consider how to advance our culture, ""will it hurt profits?"" ought not to be the first (or even the fifth) question we ask.
The price of a stock represents the value of the company.
It turns out that the price of a stock merely reflects what a few people decided to trade it for today. Tomorrow, it will certainly be different, even if nothing about the company itself changes.
There's very little correlation with how the traders come to value a company in the market and how much value a company actually creates.
The only purpose of a company is to maximize long-term shareholder value.
Says who? Is the only purpose of your career to maximize lifetime income? If a company is the collective work of humans, we ought to measure the value that those humans seek to create.
Just because there's a number (a number that's easy to read, easy to game, easy to keep track of) doesn't mean it's relevant.","January 17, 2017","behavioral economics, value creation, profit misconceptions"

Pavlov’s in your pocket,"Why do people buy lottery tickets?
It's certainly not based on any rational analysis of financial risk or reward.
So, why do something that almost never seems to work?
Because it actually works every single time.
What it does is release a hit of dopamine, first when you think about buying one, then again when you decide to buy one, and then a third time when you actually transact. For regular players, these three moments of hope and joy demolish the sadness that comes from actually losing.

How to make a sign,"Thereitis, at every entrance to the terminal at LaGuardia, one of the busiest airports in the world:

A few questions on our way to fixing this:
Who is it for?
What impact will it have on everyone else?
To the sign maker: Are you angry? Frustrated? Trying to teach people a lesson?
What does it sound like when you read it aloud?

When I look at this sign, I wonder why it needs to say, ""until further notice."" After all, aren't all rules in place until further notice?
And why say 12:00 a.m. when midnight is so much more clear?
Do we really need to alert employees to this ruleevery day?
Mostly, though, the headline is confusing (every person reading this sign for the first time is sure the terminal is closed right this minute, until they read the next line).
Perhaps, then, it might be a better sign if it said:

But where did the algorithm come from?,"Imagine if the owner of the local bookstore hid books from various authors or publishers. They're on the shelf, sure, but misfiled, or hidden behind other books. Most of us would find this offensive, and I for one like the freedom I have (for now) to choose a new store, one that connects me to what I need.
The airline tickets I purchased last week are missing. Oh, here they are, in my spam folder. Gmail blames an algorithm, as if it wrote itself.
That person who just got stopped on her way to an airplane—the woman who gets stopped every time she flies—the TSA says it's the algorithm doing it. But someone wrote that code.
And as AI gets ever better at machine learning, we'll hear over and over that the output isn't anyone's responsibility, because, hey, the algorithm wrote the code.
We need to speak up.
You have policies and algorithms in place where you work, passed down from person to person. Decision-making approaches that help you find good customers, or lead to negative redlining… What they have in common is that they are largely unexamined.
Google's search results and news are the work of human beings. Businesses thrive or suffer because of active choices made by programmers and the people they work for. They have conflicting goals, but the lack of transparency leads to hiding behind the algorithm.
The priority of which Facebook news come up is the work of a team of people. The defense of, ""the results just follow the algorithm,"" is a weak one, because there's more than one valid algorithm, more than one set of choices that can be made, more than one set of priorities.
The culture (our politics, our standards, our awareness of what's happening around us) is being aggressively rewired by what we see, and what we see comes via an algorithm, one that was written by people.

Fixing the buffet line,"Here's the obvious way: Watch people waiting to go through the line. Find the spot where the line slows down, where there's a gap between one person and the next. That's the spot that needs attention. Add a few spoons, pre-portion the item, remove a step.
Here's another way: Schedule how people enter the line. By managing the flow, you'll relax the participants and eliminate rush times.
Here's a better way: Pull the table away from the wall so people can walk on either side, thus giving your throughput a chance to practically double.
If you work on an assembly line, it's likely that someone has already thought about this.
But many of us are soloists, or do dozens of tasks a day. It's not as easy to notice where the bottlenecks are, so we have to look for them.
Have you considered the high cost of task switching? It probably takes you a little while to stop doing one thing and start doing another with efficiency. What happens when you switch less often?
Also: Consider the sprint test. If there's a task that comes up often, challenge yourself and your team to, just this once, organize and prepare to set a world record at actually completing this task. Get all the materials and processes set in advance. Now, with focus, seek out your most efficient flow.
Obviously, you can't do this every single time, but what did you learn? Steal the best parts and add them to your daily practice.
Is there someone who is more productive at a given task than you are? Watch and model. Even the way you hold the scoop, reach across the table or move the mouse is sufficient to change everything.
One last thought: Inspections are essential to maintain quality, but re-inspection is duplicative and slows things down. Where is the best place to be sure you've done the work properly? Do it there and then, and not again, and not five times. Organizing to build quality into the process, with steps that check themselves, is far more productive than constant task switching and over-inspection.","January 11, 2017","Efficiency, Productivity, Bottlenecks"
Entitlement is optional,"It’s not forced on us, it’s something we choose.
And we rarely benefit from that choice.
That emergency surgery, the one that saved your life, when the ruptured appendix was removed—the doctor left a scar.
We can choose to be grateful for our next breath.
Or we can find a way to be enraged, to point out that given how much it costs and how much training the doctor had, that scar really ought to be a lot smaller. And on top of that, he wasn’t very nice. We’re entitled to a nice doctor!
Or we can choose to be grateful.
Marketers have spent trillions of dollars persuading us that we can have it all, that we deserve it, and that right around the corner is something even better.
Politicians have told us that they’ll handle everything, that our pain is real and that an even better world is imminent.
And we believe it. We buy into our privilege as well as the expectation that our privilege entitles us to even more. It’s not based on status or reality. It’s a cultural choice.
And you’re entitled to your entitlement if you want it.
But why would you?
Entitlement gets us nothing but heartache. It blinds us to what’s possible. It insulates us from the magic of gratitude. And most of all, it lets us off the hook, pushing us away from taking responsibility (and action) and toward apportioning blame and anger instead.
Gratitude, on the other hand, is just as valid a choice. Except that gratitude makes us open to possibility. It brings us closer to others. And it makes us happier.
There’s a simple hack at work here:We’re not grateful because we’re happy. We’re happy because we’re grateful.

Is kindness a luxury?,"Luxury goods are only consumed when we've got enough. You shouldn't go shopping for a Birkin bag with your last dollar.
It's easy to believe that kindness is like that. We need more reserves, perhaps, before we can expend some of what we've got in this generous way.
You've had a hard day, it's raining out, the world is changing, your boss is mean to you, the checking account is overdrawn, you're on deadline…
But… Does every need have to be filled, every emotion in place before we're capable of being kind?
Do we have to have enough money, enough confidence about the future and enough of everything else we crave before we can find the space to offer someone else a hand?
It turns out that the opposite is true. That kindness is a foundation for the rest. That investing time and resources in extending ourselves shifts the rest of our needs in precisely the right direction, not only putting us closer to satisfying those other needs, but enjoying the journey as well.

“Everything should be made as simple as possible,but no simpler.”*
[*Ironically, this isn’t what Einstein actually said. It was this, “It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.” Alas, I’ve been seduced into believing that the shorter one now works better.]
Is it possible we’ve made things simpler than they ought to be, and established non-curiosity as the new standard?
We are certainly guilty of being active participants in a media landscape that breaks Einstein’s simplicity law every day. And having gotten away with it so far, we’re now considering removing the law from our memory.
The economics seem to be that the only way to make a living is to reach a lot of people and the only way to reach a lot of people is to race to the bottom, seek out quick clicks, make it easy to swallow, reinforce existing beliefs, keep it short, make it sort of fun, or prurient, or urgent, and most of all, dumb it down.
And that’s the true danger of anti-intellectualism. While it’s foolish to choose to be stupid, it’s cultural suicide to decide that insights, theories and truth don’t actually matter. If we don’t care to learn more, we won’t spend time or resources on knowledge.

The media has always bounced between pandering to make a buck and upping the intellectual ante of what they present. Now that this balance has been ceded to an algorithm, we’re on the edge of a breakneck race to the bottom, with no brakes and no break in sight.
Vote with your clicks, with your sponsorship, with your bookstore dollars. Vote with your conversations, with your letters to the editor, by changing the channel…
Even if only a few people use precise words, employ thoughtful reasoning and ask difficult questions, it still forces those around them to catch up. It’s easy to imagine a slippery slope down, but there’s also the cultural ratchet, a positive function in which people race to learn more and understand more so they can keep up with those around them.
Turn the ratchet. We can lead our way back to curiosity, inquiry and discovery if we (just a few for now) measure the right things and refuse the easy option in favor of insisting on better.","January 4, 2017","media decline, anti-intellectualism, curiosity"
Crossing the awareness threshold,"The blockchain, game theory, float tanks, turmeric, Justin Trudeau, Joi Ito, dal fry, thermite, the Corbomite Maneuver… these are all notions (people, ideas, technologies, foods) that you may or may not be aware of or have engaged with.
There's a path:
It's pretty clear that most the world is unaware of you and your work.
Once someone becomes aware of it, they'll probably leave it at that. ""Oh."" Because we're busy. And afraid of the new, because it often causes us to change our minds, which is frightening and difficult.
But sometimes, the culture or our work gives us no choice but to engage. We begin by putting this new thing into a category, so we know what to do with it, how to store the concept. Often, that's immediately followed by forming an opinion.
It's a huge leap, then, to go from, ""Yuck, they make protein bars out of crickets,"" to, ""I am going to try one.""
After an experience, it's possible for a new opinion to be formed. But we like to be right, so that first opinion often sticks around.
And finally, seven steps in, it's possible that the word will spread, that awareness will be shared, that we'll tell someone else. And so the awareness barrier is crossed again, and the idea spreads, and opinions are truly locked in.
Some of these stages happen in clumps. Sometimes they take months or years to occur. How much time passed between the day you became aware that hockey was a spectator sport and the first time you went to a game?
We benefit when we're aware of how our idea will work its way through all seven stages, and cognizant that the process is different depending on the category, the culture and the people we're engaging with. Do it on purpose.","January 3, 2017","Awareness, Engagement, Opinion Formation"
Wondering—past and future,"Wondering about your past, about what might have happened, about bad decisions made and roads not taken… this is a recipe for not much more than regret.
But wondering about your future?
When we wonder about the future, we get a chance to begin again, to set new goals and envision bold plans.
No more chances to do yesterday over, sorry. But infinite chances for tomorrow.
If you could do tomorrow over again, would you?","January 2, 2017","Regret, Future, Goals"
The choice,"Attitude is the most important choice any of us will make. We made it yesterday and we get another choice to make it today. And then again tomorrow.
The choice to participate.
To be optimistic.
To intentionally bring out the best in other people.
We make the choice to inquire, to be curious, to challenge the status quo.
To give people the benefit of the doubt.
To find hope instead of fear in the face of uncertainty.
Of course these are attitudes. What else could they be?
And of course, they are a choice. No one does these things to us. We choose them and do the work (and find the benefits) that come with them.","January 1, 2017","Attitude, Choice, Optimism"
“And then what happens?”,"A simple dialog can turn opinions into plans (or perhaps, into less tightly held opinions).
We ask, ""and then what happens?""
Flesh it out. Tell us step by step. The more detail the better.
No miracles allowed. And it helps if each step is a step that's worked before, somewhere and sometime else. The other question that helps with this is, ""has that step ever worked before?""
We don't have a shortage of loud and strongly held points of view about business, culture, or technology. But it may be that finding the time to draw a map helps us get to where we want to go (or to realize that we need a new map).","February 28, 2017","dialog, plans, mapping"

What bureaucracy can’t do for you,"It lets us off the hook in many ways. It creates systems and momentum and eliminates many decisions for its members.
""I'm just doing my job.""
""That's the way the system works.""
Most of all, it gives us a structure to lean against, a way of being in the world without always understanding the big picture or the side effects or the implications of our actions. Bureaucracy, the organizational imperative, the system of meetings and people and leverage—it keeps us sane.
The one thing it can't do, though, is let you off the hook.
When you write your history, and when others judge you, they will not accept that you had no choice. What you did when it felt like it was too difficult to say 'no' is precisely who you are.
We remember the people who said 'no' when they thought they had no good options. And we remember the people who went along as well.
We get the benefits of bureaucracy, but we also have to accept the costs. And the biggest one is that we're required to own our actions, to speak up, stand up and act up when we're asked to do the wrong thing.
The alternative is to lose our agency and to accept that we're no longer human.",,"bureaucracy, agency, responsibility"
The why of urgent vs. important,"You know you should be focusing on the long-term journey, on building out the facility, signing up new customers or finishing your dissertation.
But instead, there's a queue of urgent things, all justifiable, all requiring you and you alone to handle them. And so you do, pushing off the important in favor of the urgent.
Of course, everyone has this challenge, but some people manage to get past it. Even you, the last time you made a major move forward. Think about it–those urgencies from a few years ago: who's handling them now?
The reason we go for urgent is that it makes us feel competent. We're good at it. We didn't used to be, but we are now.
Important, on the other hand, is fraught with fear, with uncertainty and with the risk of failure.
Now that you know why, you can dance with it.","February 26, 2017","Urgent, Important, Time Management"

No one in the lounge seems particularly happy to be there. Perhaps they enjoyed smoking when they first started, but now, it sure looks like they realize that it's expensive, unhealthy and a bit of a hassle. Something they feel compelled to do.
The thing is, there are a few people near the lounge busy checking their phones, and they seem just as unhappy about what they're doing.

“Hit the red button”,"Everyone on your team should have one.
When we hit the button, it instantly alerts the CEO or someone who willingly takes responsibility for what happens next.
And then the question: What are the circumstances where an employee should (must) hit the red button? Consider:
If you don't have a button, why not?
The red button makes it clear to your team that they should either solve important problems on the spot or let you do so, and that not treating a problem seriously is not an option.
And if you don't treat your project seriously enough to have a button, if there isn't a culture where you want people to either fix these sorts of problems or get them looked at immediately, why not?
We can compromise our way into just about anything. At least do it on purpose.","February 24, 2017","red button, team responsibility, problem-solving"
Over/with,"You connectwithsomeone.
But you exert poweroversomeone.
You can dance and communicate and engagewitha partner. It's a two way street, a partnership.
On the other hand, you either exert controloversomeone, or you areundertheir control. If you want to be an Olympic wrestler, you need to be comfortable (not necessarily in favor of, but willing to live with) the idea that you will spend time under.
For thousands of years, we've built our culture to teach people to not only tolerate a powerful overlord, but in a vacuum, to seek one out. We build school around the idea of powerful teachers, coaches and authority figures telling us what to do. We go to the placement office to seek a job, instead of starting our own thing, because we've been taught that this is the way it works, it's reliable, it's safer.
And so we're pushed to begin withunder, notwith.
The connection economy begins to undermine this dynamic. But it's frightening. It's frightening to have your own media channel, your own platform, your own ability to craft a community and 1,000 true fans. So instead, we seek out someone to tell us what to do, to trade this for that.
I think it's becoming clear that power doesn't scale like it used to. Too many unders and not enough withs.

Drawing a line in the sand,"There are two real problems with this attitude:
First, drawing lines. Problems aren't linear, people don't fit into boxes. Lines are not nuanced, flexible or particularly well-informed. A line is a shortcut, a lazy way to deal with a problem you don't care enough about to truly understand.
Most of all, drawing a line invites the other person to cross it.

Our worldview casts a shadow in the words that resonate,"One reason it's difficult to understand each other is that behind the words we use are the worldviews, the emotions and the beliefs we have before we even consider what's being said.
Before we get to right and wrong, good or bad, effective or ineffective, we begin with worldview.
They affect the way we choose a car, engage in a conversation or vote. These cultural and learned worldviews alter the way we see and hear and speak.
Words like: Fairness, change, interference, freedom, responsibility and opportunity trigger different reactions based on worldview. It's always easier to encourage action based on an existing worldview than it is to change that view.
The columns below don't line up for everyone (or anyone), but instead highlight different instincts on different axes on how each of us see the world in any given moment…
Once we understand the landscape that someone sees, we have an easier time using words and images to fill in that landscape, to create a story that they can hear and understand, and, perhaps, we can make change happen.","February 20, 2017","Worldview, Communication, Perception"

Interesting problems,"Being locked out of your car is not an interesting problem. Call five locksmiths, hire the cheap and fast one, you'll be fine.
And getting a script written or a book cover designed isn't that interesting either. There are thousands of trained professionals happy to do it for you.
On the other hand, if you need a script that will win awards, sell tickets and change lives, that's difficult. And interesting. Or if you need a book cover that will leap off the shelf, define a segment, make a career—that's hard as well.
An interesting problem is one that's never been solved in quite this way before. It's not always going to work. The stakes are high. It involves coloring outside the lines.
Most solution providers (freelancers/firms/professionals) shy away from the interesting problems. There's not a lot of firm ground to stand on. There's more apparent risk than most people are comfortable with. It's too easy to shy away and pull back a little.

Power and reason,"A fish is not like a bicycle, but they're not mutually exclusive. You can have both.
Part of our culture admires reason. It celebrates learning. It seeks out logic and coherence and an understanding of the how and the why.
At the same time, there are other people who seek out influence and authority. Either to exercise it or to blindly follow it.
Sometimes, they overlap. Sometimes, power is guided by reason. But that's not required, not in the short run.  And sometimes, reasonable, informed people wield power. But again, as a visit to a university's English department will show, not always.
It's tempting for the powerful to argue with those that admire reason, pointing out how much power they wield.
And it's tempting for the well-informed to argue with those that have power, pointing out how little reason they possess.
But just as a fish isn't going to stop you from riding a bicycle, theseargumentsrarely work, because power and reason don't live on the same axis. Listening to someone argue from the other axis is a little like watching TV with the sound off. It might look normal, but it is hard to follow.

“Nothing wrong with having standards”,"This is the snarky feedback of someone whose bias is to hustle instead of to stand for something.
When you say 'no' to their pitch, they merely smile and congratulate you on the quaint idea that you have standards.
Their mindset is to cut corners, slip things by if they can. The mindset of, ""Well, it can'thurt to ask."" Predators and scavengers, nosing around the edges and seeing what they score.
They talk about standards as if they're a luxury, the sort of thing you can do as a hobby, but way out of the mainstream.
The thing is, if you begin with standards and stick with them, you don't have to become a jackal to make ends meet. Not only is there nothing wrong with having standards, it turns out to be a shortcut to doing great work and making an impact.","February 16, 2017","standards, hustle, integrity"
The pact,"At some point, you'll need to make a deal with yourself.
What is this career for? What are the boundaries? What are you keeping score of, maximizing, improving? Who do you serve?
Once you make this pact, don't break it without a great deal of serious thought.
You might say you're seeking to create freedom and joy. But then, incrementally, you find yourself trading freedom for money, for status or for approval from strangers…
Or you might sign up to build leverage and wealth. Which is fine, except when you blink in the face of the huge opportunity you've worked hard for.
We know you can't have everything. No one can. So, what's it for?
The best time to make a pact is right now. And the worst time to re-visit this pact is when there's a lot of short-term pressure.

It might be that the way you treat your employees, or the side effects you create count for more than the price.

Making change (in multiples),"It's tempting to seek to change just one person at a time. After all, if you fail, no one will notice.
It's also tempting to try to change everyone. But of course, there really is noeveryone, not any more. Too much noise, too many different situations and narratives. When you try to change everyone, you're mostly giving up.
The third alternative is where real impact happens: Finding a cohort of people who want to change together.
Organizing them and then teaching and leading them.
It's not only peer pressure. But that helps.
When a group is in sync, the change is reinforcing. When people can see how parts of your message resonate with their peers, they're more likely to reconsider them in a positive light. And mostly, as in all modern marketing,""people like us do things like this""is the primary driver.
I got a note from a reader, who asked, ""Not only you, but many business authors do promotions like if I buy 2, 10, 100… (or whatever number greater than 1) copies, I get perks. Honestly, I never really got this concept. As I understand, you get the most value out of business/self improvement books, if you buy them for yourself (and when you read them in the right time of your life).""
The thing is, my goal isn't to sell books, it's to make change. And withYour Turn, I took the idea of changing in groups quite seriously. The site doesn't sell single copies, only multiples (when you buy one, I send you two, etc.). Here's what I've discovered after five printings of the book: When an organization (or a team, or a tiny group) all read and talk about the same book, the impact is exponentially greater.
If you want to make change, begin by making culture. Begin by organizing a tightly knit group. Begin by getting people in sync.

The two vocabularies (because there are two audiences),"Early adopters want to buy a different experience than people who identify as the mass market do.
Innovators want something fresh, exciting, new and interesting.
The mass market doesn't. They want something that works.
It's worth noting here that you're only an early adopter sometimes, when you want to be. And you're only in the mass market by choice as well. It's an attitude.
The people bringing new ideas to the public are early adopters themselves (because it's often more thrilling than working in a field that does what it did yesterday), and often default to using words that appeal to people like themselves, as opposed to the group in question.
More rarely, there are a few people with a mass market mindset that are charged with launching something for the early adopters, and they make the opposite mistake, dressing up their innovation as something that's supposed to feel safe.
When you bring a product or service or innovation to people who like to go first, consider words/images like:
On the other hand, people who aren't seeking disruption are more likely to respond to:
Of course, it's important that these words be true, that your product, your service and its place in the world match the story you're telling about it.

Proximity and intimacy,"I recently did a talk where the organizer set up the room in the round, with the stage in the middle. He proudly told me that it would create a sense of intimacy because more people would be close to the stage.
Of course, this isn't true. Physical proximity is one thing, but connection and intimacy come from eye contact, from hearing and being heard, from an exchange of hopes and dreams.
Cocktail parties involve too many people in too small a room, but they rarely create memorable interactions. And the digital world eliminates the barriers of space, supposedly enhancing our ability to make a connection.
Too often, though, we use that physical or digital proximity to push others away instead of to invite them in. We hesitate to lean in or to raise our hands. The speaker in the round has no choice but to turn her back to half the audience, no physical way to make eye contact and get a sense of what's happening. In the hundreds or thousands of interactions we have each day, proximity gives us the chance to connect, but it doesn't ensure it will happen.

What’s the next step for media (and for us)?,"Perhaps the biggest cultural change of my lifetime has been the growing influence and ubiquity of commercial media in our lives.
Commercial media companies exist to make a profit, and they've grown that profit faster than just about any industry you can name.
At first, it was the scarcity created by the FCC (a few channels) and mass markets that led the industry. Now, though, it's a chaotic system with different rules.
A system that rewards certain outputs, relentlessly, generating ever more of those outputs. The participants all believe that the ends will justify the means, all believe that in the end, it'll lead to a positive outcome. But, taken together, over time, drip, drip, drip, the system wins.
They do this by engaging with ever more of our time, our decisions and our systems. They do this by selling not just ads, but the stories and expectations that change the way we engage with those ads.
They sow dissatisfaction—advertising increases our feeling of missing out, and purchasing offers a momentary respite from that dissatisfaction.
Much of that dissatisfaction is about more vs. enough, about moving up a commercial ladder that's primarily defined by things that can be purchased. It's possible to have far more than your grandparents did but still be deeply unhappy believing that you don't have enough.
And so one purpose of work is to get enough money to buy more stuff, and to have the time to consume more media (so we can buy more stuff).
The media amplifies anxiety, and then offer programming that offers relief from that anxiety.
It's beenshownrepeatedly that watching TV increases the perception that other places, particularly cities, are far more dangerous than they are.
The media likes events and circuses and bowl games, because they have a beginning and an ending, and because they can be programmed and promoted. They invite us into the situation room, alarm us with breaking news and then effortlessly move onto the next crisis.
They train us to expect quick and neat resolutions to problems, because those are easier to sell.
They push us to think short-term, to care about now and not later.
And now they're being gamed at their own game, because the artificial scarcity that was created by the FCC has been replaced by a surplus and a race to the bottom, with no gatekeepers and with plenty of advertisers willing to pay for any shred of attention.
Intellectual pursuits don't align with the options that media would rather have us care about.
A walk in the woods with a friend or your kids does the media-industrial complex no good at all. It's sort of the opposite of pro wrestling.
Books are the lowest form of media (too slow, too long-lasting, no sponsors, low profit) while instant-on, always-on social networks are about as good as it gets. For the media.
If you're not the customer, you're the product.
I was talking with a smart friend the other day and she said that the media is just a reflection of us. I'm not buying it. There are many reflections of us, and the craven race to the bottom is just one of them. The people with the mirror have a responsibility, and in exchange for our time and our spectrum, that responsibility is to make us better, not merely more profitable.
We've been willing participants in this daily race for our attention and our emotions. But we don't have to be.

Worst of all, important projects don't get done.
All of us have been changed by a great presentation. Perhaps it was a TED talk that delivered a message that we just can't forget. Or it was a brand manager who brought humanity and insight to a new project and got funded on the spot. Or maybe it was a professional fundraiser who sat across the desk from you and delivered a Keynote presentation that caused you to make a donation that saved lives, built a school or wove our community just a bit more tightly…
Sixteen years ago I published a rant about Powerpoint and how it was taking away our ability to make change happen.

But just because you’re working for free doesn’t mean you should give away all your upsides.
Consider the major publishing platforms that are happy to host your work, but you need to sign away your copyright. Or get no credit. Or give the publisher the right to change your work in any way they see fit, or to use your image (in perpetuity) and your reputation for commercial gain without your oversight or participation…
Now, more than ever, you have the power to say “no” to that.

What posterity has done for us,"Sir Boyle Roche famously said, ""Why we should put ourselves out of our way to do anything for posterity, for what has posterity ever done for us?""
Quite a lot, actually.
We were born into a culture that took generations to create. The people who came before us built a civil society, invented a language, created a surplus, enabling us to each grow up without contributing much at all for the first 15 years of our life. Posterity, as created by the folks that came before, solved countless problems so we could work on the problems that lie ahead.
Posterity gave us jazz, the scientific method and medicine. It gave us a stable platform to connect, to invent and to produce.
We are someone else's posterity. Each of us is here, and is able to do what we do, because others did something for posterity.
In many ways, our contributions to each other and our culture are a tiny repayment of our huge debt to people we'll never get to meet. People who sacrificed and stood up for posterity. Otherwise known as us.
I've never met anyone who honestly felt that they would have been better off living at the beginning of any century other than this one.
And our job is to build the foundations necessary for our great grandchildren to feel the same way about the world they're born in.

But often, this sort of winning is actually losing.
That's because we rarely have an interaction only once, and we often engage with people we know, where reputation and connection are at stake.

We move up all the imagined benefits and costs of something in the future and experience them now. That's why it's hard to stick to a diet (because celery tastes bad today, and we can't easily experience feeling healthy in ten years). That's why we make such dumb financial decisions (because it's so tempting to believe magical stories about tomorrow).
If you want people to be smarter or more active or more generous about their future, you'll need to figure out how to make the transaction about how it feels right now.","February 3, 2017","future, investment, decision-making"
Pole vaulting on Jupiter,"Even an Olympic athlete is going to do poorly on Jupiter. The gravity is two and half times greater, which means you're just not going to jump very well.
On the other hand, our moon gives you a huge advantage… You weigh less than 30 pounds.
It's a mistake to judge your effort or your form in either setting. It's not, ""I jumped poorly on Jupiter and because of my poor form, I only went three feet."" Instead, it's more like, ""I jumped on Jupiter and I went three feet.""
There were two events: the jump and the result.
Best idea: Don't pole vault on Jupiter. Do it on the moon if you need a good score.
Second best idea: If you're stuck on Jupiter, give yourself some slack instead of crawling away in shame.","February 2, 2017","Pole vaulting, Jupiter, moon"

But when will you abandon it?,"Not if, but when.
You and your team have already given up on carrier pigeons, typewriters and probably, fax machines.
And the spreadsheet has totally changed not only your accounting, but much of your decision making. My guess is that your industry doesn't use radio as its primary brand building tool, and you don't heat the office with coal, either.
So, when will you abandon the employee review system you've had for thirty years? Or the meeting culture? Or the expensive, boring and not particularly effective training regime your HR team is stuck with?
Not if, but when.
Putting a date on it might make the transition go better.

Merely transactional,"""We owe you nothing.""
This week, all but one NFL owner voted to let the Raiders leave Oakland for Las Vegas (I'm not a football fan, but bear with me).
A nearly perfect example of how one version of capitalism corrupts our culture.
The season ticket holder bought a ticket and got his games. Even steven. We owe you nothing.
The dedicated fan sat through endless losing games. Even steven. Ticket purchased, game delivered. We owe you nothing.
The problem with 'even steven' is that it turns trust and connection and emotions into nothing but a number. Revenue on a P&L. It ignores the long-term in exchange for a relentless focus on today. Only today.
There's an alternative view of capitalism. Modern capitalism. Capitalism for the long-term.  In this view, the purpose of an enterprise is to make things better. To minimize negative externalities and create value. Value for the owners, sure, but also for the workers, the customers and the bystanders.
""We owe you everything.""
You trusted us. You showed up. You tolerated our impact on your world, even when you didn't invite us in.
It'll never be even steven, but we can try to repay you. Thank you for the opportunity.
I think this is what sports fans signed up for when they were first offered the chance to support a team. Maybe your customers feel the same way.","March 31, 2017","Capitalism, Trust, Long-term value"

Nickels and dimes are worth less than that,"The real asset you're building is trust.
And even though it's tempting to cut a corner here and there to boost profit per interaction, the real cost is huge.
No one will say anything, no one will put up a fuss, until one day, they're gone. Those extra few dollars you made with some fancy footwork have now cost you tens of thousands of dollars in lost value.

What if scale wasn’t the goal?,"From restaurants to direct mail, there's pressure to be scalable, to be efficient, to create something easily replicated.

Unselling,"Getting someone to switch to you is totally different from getting someone who's new to the market to start using the solution you offer.
Switching means:
Admitting I was wrong, and, in many cases, leaving behind some of my identity, because my tribe (as I see them) is using what I used to use.
So, if you want to get a BMW motorcycle owner to buy a Harley as his next bike, you have your work cut out for you.
He's not eager to say, ""well, I got emotionally involved with something, but I realized that there's a better choice so I switched, I was wrong and now I'm right.""
And he's certainly not looking forward to walking away from his own self-defined circle and enduring the loneliness as he finds a new circle.
Which leads to three things to think about:
We invent a status quo every time we settle on something, because we'd rather tell ourselves that we made a good decision than live with the feeling that we didn't.","March 27, 2017","Unselling, Switching, Identity"
Toward civilization,"If war has an opposite, it's not peace, it's civilization.(inspired byUrsulaLeGuinwriting in 1969)
Civilization is the foundation of every successful culture. It permits us to live in safety, without being crippled by fear. It's the willingness to discuss our differences, not to fight over them. Civilization is efficient, in that it permits every member of society to contribute at her highest level of utility. And it's at the heart of morality, because civilization is based on fairness.
The civilization of a human encampment, a city or town where people look out for one another and help when help is needed is worth seeking out.
We're thrilled by the violentvideoof the iguana and the snakes, partly because we can't imagine living a life like that, one where we are always at risk.
To be always at risk, to live in a society where violence is likely—this undermines our ability to be the people we seek to become.
Over the last ten generations, we've made huge progress in creating an ever more civilized culture. Slavery (still far too prevalent) is now seen as an abomination. Access to information and healthcare is better than it's ever been. Human culture is  far from fully civilized, but as the years go by, we're getting better at seeing all the ways we have to improve.
And this can be our goal. Every day, with every action, to make something more civilized. To find more dignity and possibility and opportunity for those around us, those we know and don't know.
Hence the imperative. Our associations, organizations and interactions must begin with a standard of civility. Our work as individuals and as leaders becomes worthwhile and generous when we add to our foundation of civilization instead of chipping away at it.
The standard can come from each of us. We can do it. We can speak up. We can decide to care a little more. We can stand up to the boss, the CEO, or the elected representative and say, ""wait,"" when they cross the line, when they pursue profit at the cost of community, when they throw out the rules in search of a brawl instead. The race to the bottom and the urge to win at all costs aren't new, but they're not part of who we are and ought to be.","March 26, 2017","civilization, morality, community"
Holding your breadth,"It's tempting to diversify, particularly when it comes to what you offer the world.
One more alternative, one more flavor, one more variation.
Something for everyone.
We get pushed to smooth out the work, make it softer, more widely applicable.
More breadth, though, doesn't cause change, and it won't get you noticed.

Seriously vs. personally,"Professionals take their work seriously. The work matters, the impacts and externalities are real.

The reason we need the FDA (hint: it’s marketers),"Here's the original ad for Coca-Cola:
French Wine Coca is indorsed (sic) by over 20,000 of the most learned and scientific medical men in the world . . . . . . Americans are the most nervous people in the world . . . All who are suffering from any nervous complaints we commend to use the wonderful and delightful remedy, French Wine Coca, infallible in curing all who are afflicted with any nerve trouble, dyspepsia, mental and physical exhaustion, all chronic wasting diseases, gastric irritability, constipation, sick headache, neuralgia, etc. is quickly cured by the Coca Wine . . . . . . Coca is a most wonderful invigorator of the sexual organs and will cure seminal weakness, impotency, etc., when all other remedies fail . . . To the unfortunate who are addicted to the morphine or opiate habit, or the excessive use of alcohol stimulants, the French Wine Coca has proven a great blessing, and thousands proclaim it the most remarkable invigorator that every sustained a wasting and sinking system. (Thanks to Adam Alter's urgent and powerful newbook).
John Pemberton, who wrote this ad, was addicted to the cocaine in the product and ultimately died from stomach cancer, an addict. Just six years later his son died from the same addiction.
In a competitive environment, in which some marketers are rewarded for the short-term hit, the race to the bottom is inevitable. That doesn't mean it works, but it hurts. Self-regulation doesn't work in large markets that have easy entry, with many short-term competitive battles going on.
Smart, ethical marketers understand that regulation actually helps them do their work.

To tell the truth,"Thirty years ago, Fleischmann and Pons announced that they were able to createfusionat room temperature. Scientists around the world began work in this new field, only to discover that they couldn't replicate the reported results. It turns out that the original researchers hadn't told the truth. Millions of dollars and countless hours were wasted.
Science is based on honestly and accurately reporting what happened. Not reporting an opinion or a point of view as much as actual events and theories that fit those events.
But the same thing is true of the results you got from the direct marketing test you did yesterday.
And the efficacy of a new cancer vaccine or economic policy.
We need people to report what's actually true, so we can work with it.
The same thinking applies to whether or not your product made money last month and what temperature it was in Cleveland on Tuesday.
On the other hand, we don't expect the truth in a poker game, in the negotiation of the price of a new car or even in the stump speech of a political candidate. We signed up for shadings and hyperbole and some gamesmanship.
The key concept here, as usual, is enrollment. If the scientific community is enrolled with you in hearing the factual results of replicable experiments, then it's on you to engage with that honestly. If your co-workers are enrolled to hear the truth about the culture of your organization or the results of a new initiative, the entire system depends on you keeping up your end of the bargain.
Living without accurate reporting of results, when it's what we expect, goes far beyond the ethical problem with lying. Like the toxic loans that led to the financial crisis of 2008, when lies are mixed in with the expectation for truth, the system grinds to a halt. We have to spend time filtering instead of actually getting our work done.
It's an incredible privilege to have a role where you are expected to tell the truth. Your colleagues are trusting you, letting down their guard and enabling you to contribute highly-leveraged work.
It doesn't take much to break that trust and to degrade the efficiency of the entire system.

Counting beans,"If you have to serve chili to 1,000 people, holding back just one bean from each person means you end up with a tidy savings, and almost no one is going to notice.
If you run a call center and hire people who make a dollar less an hour, who are less supported, or less trained, or less caring, the impact on each interaction will probably seem pretty small. Of course, if you have a thousand operators, you just saved a lot of money.
And, if you make cars and you figure out how to replace a bolt with a slightly less resilient one, very few drivers will notice, and if you make 200,000 cars a year, that might be enough to pay your entire salary.
You've already guessed the problem.
Some people will notice that the portions are a little skimpy. Some customers will be annoyed enough to switch to another company. And some people are going to die.
When we add up lots of little compromises, we get to celebrate the big win. But overlooked are the unknown costs over time, the erosion in brand, the loss in quality, the subtraction from something that took years to add up.

"Fear, failure and shame, oh my","Fear runs deep. Fear used to keep our ancestors alive. Fear keeps you from taunting a saber tooth tiger.
The thing is, most of us don’t have to deal with tigers any longer. But the fear still runs deep.
We still feel the same feelings when we face possible failure, but now those feelings revolve around shame. Losing a videogame in private is fine, but asking a stupid question in a meeting is not.
Shame is the dream killer, because shame (or the possibility of shame) amplifies our fear of fear, keeps us from contributing and short circuits our willingness to explore.
As soon as we give it a name, though, as soon as we call it out, we can begin to move forward. Fear of shame unspoken is fear of shame amplified.
Be afraid of significant failure if you can quantify the downsides. But fear of shame is a waste and a trap.","March 18, 2017","Fear, Shame, Failure"
The half-life of a near miss,"How long does it take to forget how frightening it was?

The stories we tell ourselves are powerful indeed. I got food poisoning as a kid and never again ate at the restaurant that caused it, even after the restaurant went out of business and was replaced by a totally different business, which then went out of business and was replaced again. There was no rational reason to avoid that particular building, but our myths run deep.

Is ignorance the problem?,"It's nice to think that the reason that people don't do what you need them to do, or conform to your standards, or make good choices is simply that they don't know enough.
After all, if that's the case, all you'll need to do is inform them, loudly and clearly.
So, that employee who shows up late: just let her know that being late isn't allowed. Threaten to fire her. That'll do it.
The thing is, ignorance is rarely the problem.
The challenge is that people don't always care about what you care about. And the reason they don't careisn'tthat they don't know what you know.
The reason is thatthey don't believe what you believe.
The challenge, then, isn't to inform them. It's to engage and teach and communicate in a way that shares emotion and values and beliefs.",,"ignorance, engagement, beliefs"
The thing you can’t have becomes a powerful placebo,"The efficacy of a technology, a shortcut, a medicine, a tool, a method—you get the idea—is directly related to how difficult it is to obtain.
Placeboswork because our brain picks up where our belief begins. Without some sort of conscious or subconscious trigger, the placebo effect never kicks in. But when it does, it's astonishingly effective. Placebos change performance, cure diseases and make food taste better.
Consider the case of the new music format,MQA. The overdue successor to the MP3 files we've been listening to for a decade or more, MQA treats your music with more care, and the reports are it sounds better. A lot better.
Of course, most people can't hear the difference in a double-blind test, particularly with disposable earbuds. But that's okay, because no one is double blind in real life. Instead, we have information about what we're listening to and where it came from, and it turns out that knowing the provenance of your music can actually make it sound better.
The fact that MQA might actually sound better is a fine thing, but the lesson here is about the story.
The MQA rollout has been agonizingly slow, with dates promised and then missed, with absent bits of gear, with no easy way to get this new technology. Which makes it even better, of course.
The same is true for baked goods that sell out every morning at 8 am, and the new beta-version of an app that makes you more productive.

The NFL Combine is a giant talent show, with a billion dollars on the line. And every year, NFL scouts use the wrong data to pick the wrong players (Tom Bradyfamouslyrecorded one of the worst scores ever 17 years ago).Moneyballis all about how reluctant baseball scouts were to change their tactics, even after they saw that the useful data was a far better predictor of future performance than their instincts were.
And we do the same thing when we scan resumes, judging people by ethnic background, fraternity, gender or the kind of typeface they use.
The SAT is a poor indicator of college performance, but most colleges use it anyway.
Famous colleges aren't correlated with lifetime success or happiness, but we push our kids to to seek them out.
And all that time on social networks still hasn't taught us not to judge people by their profile photos…
Most of all, we now know that easy-to-measure skills aren't nearly as important as the realskillsthat matter.
Everyone believes that other people are terrible at judging us and our potential, but we go ahead and proudly judge others on the basis of a short interview (or worse, a long one), even though the people we're selecting aren't being hired for their ability to be interviewed.

People who are open, empathetic, optimistic, flexible, generous, warm, connected, creative and interesting seem to have a much easier time. They're more able to accomplish their goals, influence others and most of all, hang out with the people they'd like to be with.

Writing the review in advance,"Movie reviewers, food critics, the people who write about wine or stereo equipment… they write most of the review before they even encounter the final product.
Because, of course, they experience it before (you/they/we) think they do.
They've seen the marketing materials. They know the reputation of the director or the vineyard. They have a relationship with their editor, and an instinct about what the people they represent expect.
And of course, it goes double for the non-professional critics… your customers. And even the hiring manager when you're applying for a job.
The last click someone clicks before they buy something isn't the moment they made up their mind. And our expectations of how this is going to sound, feel or taste is pre-wired by all of the clues and hints we got along the way.
We lay clues. That's what it takes to change the culture and to cause action. The thing we make matters (a lot).

What’s on tonight?,"Just a few decades ago, there were only three TV channels to watch.
Worse, it was pretty common for people to continue watching the same channel all night, rather than checking out the two alternatives. The 8 pm lead in was critical.
TV Guide, at one point the most valuable magazine in the United States, changed that posture. The entire magazine was devoted to answering just one question: What's on right now?
It turned consumption into a bit more of an intentional act. I mean, people were still hiding out, glued to their TVs, but at least they were actively choosing which thing to watch.
The internet, of course, multiplies the number of choices by infinity.
And our screen time has only gone up.
But here's the question: The next thing you read, the next thing you watch–how did you decide that it was next?
Was it because it was the nearest click that was handy?
Or are you intentional about what you're learning, or connecting with, or the entertainment you're investing in?

Obedience and inquiry,"The first rule is that you follow the rules.
That's the mantra of the obedient organization. And there are many of them. You follow these rules, restrictions and systems. Not because they're up-to-date, effective or correct, but because that's what makes us who we are.
Obedience is its own reward. Obedience is required. And obedience is prized.
It ensures a reliable homogeneity, it gives the illusion of solidarity, it evokes power.
The alternative is an organization based on inquiry.
Do what's right and ask useful questions.
This is a supple organization, one more likely to deal with change over time. It certainly has more raucous meetings, and it sometimes appears disorganized, but the resilience can pay off.
Obedient organizations get better when they find more obedient team members and enforce their systems on them.

Cost reduce or value increase?,"Organizations that want to increase their metrics either invest in:
Creating more value for their customers, or
Doing just enough to keep going, but for less effort and money.
During their first decade, the core group at Amazon regularly amazed customers by investing in work that created more value. When you do that, people talk, the word spreads, growth happens.
Inevitably, particularly for public companies, it becomes easier to focus on keeping what you've got going, but cheaper. You may have noticed, for example, that their once legendary customer service hardly seems the same, with 6 or 7 interactions required to get an accurate and useful response.
This happens to organizations regardless of size or stature. It's a form of entropy. Unless you're vigilant, the apparently easy path of cost reduction will distract you from the important work of value creation.

On the other hand, a hurricane or a flood captures everyone's attention and causes us to leap into action.
The thing is, incremental daily progress (negative or positive) is what actually causes transformation. A figurative drip, drip, drip. Showing up, every single day, gaining in strength, organizing for the long haul, building connection, laying track—this subtle but difficult work is how culture changes. It takes a generation to change the political landscape or to build a hundred-year company.
If you want to cause action in the short run, the opposite is true. In the short run, drip by drip rarely puts people on alert. It's the thunderclap, the coordinated, accelerating work of many people, that causes those in power to sit up and take notice. Do it a few times in a row, or fifty, or a hundred, each with more impact, and you can successfully intervene.
Money makes it complicated, because money promises a shortcut. A bigger ad budget, or more VCs or more hires. We use money to hurry up, but it distracts us from what we actually seek to build.
We fail in two ways: One, when we ignore the drips around us and discover that we've been swamped by incremental culture change that we didn't see coming. And second, when we think a few chaotic but heartfelt claps are going to be sufficient to have an impact.
And we succeed when we combine the best of both worlds. When we settle in for the hard work of daily, bottoms-up institution building, and use thunderclaps not as a distraction, but as the rhythm of our forward motion.","March 3, 2017","Incremental change, Action, Cultural transformation"
When tribal adherence becomes toxic,"We see it all the time. Someone gets caught cheating, or breaking a social taboo, or undermining the fabric of our culture in order to get ahead…
And the fans of the team rush to his defense.
It happens to spiritual leaders, in sports and in politics. When a member of the tribe transgresses, our instinct is to view the attack on the transgressor as an attack on the tribe.
Of course, it's not.
Not until the tribe members abandon the cultural imperatives and support the leader instead.
Clearly, sports don't work if some players cheat with abandon. Getting rid of cheating is in the interest of all the fans, not just the ones on the other team. And more urgently, the same thing is true of the leaders we follow or the people we choose to listen to. Being a tribal leader shouldn't be a license to degrade the culture.
The bravest thing tribe members can do is judge their leaders precisely the same way they judge the leaders of other tribes. Easy to say, hard to do, because part of the tribal/fan/party dynamic is that our leaders are an expression of ourselves.","March 2, 2017","tribal adherence, cultural integrity, leadership accountability"
Who are you playing tennis with?,"There's a lot of volleying in tennis. They hit the ball, you hit it back.

You look like you’re lying (when you’re nervous),"This is a significant bug in our culture and a glitch in our DNA.
When we're on the spot, giving a speech, or pulled over by a cop, we get nervous.
We sweat, talk too fast, constrict our throat, avoid eye contact, put on a half smile and do many of the things that people often associate with lying.
At the same time, because the con man (who might also be a politician or CEO) has figured out how to avoid these telltale signs, we give them the benefit of the doubt and they lie with impunity.
If you have good intentions, you have two options: You can either avoid getting nervous (which comes with practice) or you can work on the most obvious symptoms you display, intentionally diminishing them. Actors are better on screen than the rare famous person doing a cameo because the actors have been taught how to read their lines without all the telltale signs of lying. (Of course, reading linesislying…)
If you're using a microphone, use it. No need to brace your body to shout. Talk more slowly. Intentionally make eye contact…
And don't lie. But you knew that part.

What does “science” mean?,"To countless teenagers who had the wrong teacher in high school, it means, ""a boring collection of right answers, categorized by topic.""
Once we discover that some things we were taught aren't black and white any more (Pluto, DDT, infant formula), it's not surprising that people begin to go from bored to skeptical. About all of it.
Except that's not what science is.
Science is a process. It's not pretending it has the right answer, it merely has the best process to get closer to that right answer. Science is an ongoing argument, one where you show your work and make a prediction about what's going to happen next.
And you're not allowed to have magical faeries. Not allowed to change the explanation based on what just happened. You must begin again, from first principles, and make a new argument, and show new work, and make a better prediction.
Science isn't only done in the lab. Every one of us does it at work, daily.

Who are we seeking to become?,"We get what we invest in. The time we spend comes back, with interest.
If you practice five minutes of new, difficult banjo music every day, you'll become a better banjo player. If you spend a little bit more time each day whining or feeling ashamed, that behavior will become part of you. The words you type, the people you hang with, the media you consume…
The difference between who you are now and who you were five years ago is largely due to how you've spent your time along the way.

Complicated problems rarely require magical explanations,"One clue that someone doesn't understand a problem is that they need a large number of variables and factors to explain it.
On the other hand, turning a complex situation into something overly simple is an even more common way of demonstrating ignorance of how the system works.
What we're looking for isn't the number of countable variables. It's the clarity of thought. The coherence of the explanation. The ability to have that explanation hold water even if small inputs change. The explanation might be long, but it makes sense.
Too often, the overly simplistic explanation is just a form of hand waving. We beg the question because we mention the simple explanation plus the miracle. It's the miracle, thehomunculus, the little man in the machine, that actually holds the answer, and punting on explaining it is lazy. We use magic to kick the explanation down the road, making it not simple, but obtuse.
[Examples: Magical faeries. Conspiracy theories. Science denialism. Simplistic views of marketing or culture…]
A useful description is one that can be tested, expanded and makes accurate predictions. A lazy one just makes us feel better until we actually have to engage with the system in a useful way.
It's entirely possible that you're trying to work with a complicated system, one that can't be boiled down to a simple catch phrase. That's okay. Clarity is still possible.

Avoiding the good/great chasm,"You can be good at Twitter in about five minutes a day. Spending ten minutes doesn't make you twice as good… in fact, there's probably little measurable improvement. To be great at Twitter might take five hours of daily effort.
All the time in between five minutes and five hours is wasted. You're in a chasm with no measurable benefits.
We see the same thing happen with your Yellow Pages ads or your customer service. Showing up takes some effort and it often pays off. Showing up a bunch more is often worthless. If you want to truly be great, you're going to have to do things most people couldn't imagine. That's what makes it great, after all. The scarcity of it.

Compared to what?,"A quick look at Yelp reviews will show you that NY restaurants are not quite as good as those in some suburbs.
This, of course, makes no sense. New York is insanely competitive, with a ton of turnover and a very demanding audience. A fast casual restaurant in Shaker Heights can coast for a long time, because… it's better than the alternatives.
Thanks to marketing, the media and our culture, we spend a lot of our time comparing before we decide whether or not we're happy.
Turn back the clock just 60 years. If you lived in 1957, how would your life compare to the one you live right now? Well, you have access to lifesaving medicines, often in pill form. You can choose from an infinite amount of entertainment, you can connect with humans all over the Earth, for free, at the click of a button. You have access to the sum total of human knowledge. You have control over your reproductive cycle. You can eat sushi (you've even heard of sushi). You can express yourself in a thousand ways that were forbidden then…
That's in one lifetime.
But we don't compare our lives to this imaginary juxtaposition. Instead, we hear two things from the media we choose to engage with: Other people have it better, way better. And, it's going to get worse. Add to that the idea that marketers want us to believe that what we have now isn't that good, but if we merely choose to go into a bit of debt, we can buy our way to a better outcome…
Comparison leads to frustration which sometimes leads to innovation.

The bingo method,"You might need help to turn an idea into a project.
Most of the time, though, project developers walk up to those that might help and say, “I have a glimmer of an idea, will you help me?”
The challenge: It’s too challenging. Open-ended. To offer to help means to take on too much. And of course people are hesitant to sign on for an unlimited obligation to help with something that’s important to you, not to them.
Consider the bingo method instead.
Build a 5 x 5 grid. 25 squares. Twenty-five elements that have to be present for your project to have a chance. If it’s a fundraising concert, one of the grids might be, “find a theater that will host us for less than $1,000.”
Here’s the key: Fill in most of the grids before you ask someone for generous help. When nine or twelve of the squares are marked, “done,” and when another six are marked, “in process,” then the ask is a lot smaller.

‘Sort by price’ is lazy,"Sort by price is the dominant way that shopping online now happens. The cheapest airline ticket or widget or freelancer comes up first, and most people click.
It’s a great shortcut for a programmer, of course, because the price is a number, and it’s easy to sort.
Alphabetical could work even more easily, but it seems less relevant (especially if you’re a fan of Zappos or Zima).
The problem: Just because it’s easy, it doesn’t mean it’s as useful as it appears.
It’s lazy for the consumer. If you can’t take the time to learn about your options, about quality, about side effects, then it seems like buying the cheapest is the way to go–they’re all the same anyway, we think.
And it’s easy for the producer. Nothing is easier to improve than price. It takes no nuance, no long-term thinking, no concern about externalities. Just become more brutal with your suppliers and customers, and cut every corner you can. And then blame the system.
The merchandisers and buyers at Wal-Mart were lazy. They didn’t have to spend much time figuring out if something was better, they were merely focused on price, regardless of what it cost their community in the long run.
We’re part of that system, and if we’re not happy with the way we’re treated, we ought to think about the system we’ve permitted to drive those changes.
What would happen if we insisted on ‘sort by delight’ instead?
What if the airline search engines returned results sorted by a (certainly difficult) score that combined travel time, aircraft quality, reliability, customer service, price and a few other factors? How would that change the experience of flying?
This extends far beyond air travel. We understand that it makes no sense to hire someone merely because they charge the cheapest wage. That we shouldn’t pick a book or a movie or a restaurant simply because it costs the least.
There are differences, and sometimes, those differences are worth what they cost.
‘Worth it’ is a fine goal.
What if, before we rushed to sort at all, we decided what was worth sorting for?
Low price is the last refuge of the marketer who doesn’t care enough to build something worth paying for.
In your experience, how often is the cheapest choice the best choice?

How thin is your ice?,"When something goes wrong, how do you respond?
When you own assets, when your position feels secure, when you're playing the long game, a bump in the road is just that. ""Well, that was interesting."" You can learn from it, and the professional realizes that freaking out pays little benefit.
On the other hand, the middleman, the person who realizes just how easily he can be replaced, the person who can't stop playing the short game… well, he realizes that it's all sort of a house of cards, and often indulges in the urge to freak out, disgorging panic and fear and even hatred on the person that's easy to blame.
The thing is, thin ice doesn't give you a lot of leverage, and thin ice can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.
The first step for the agent, the middle manager, the hanger-on is to invest in the long term, to find an arc that actually builds an asset that lasts.
And the second is to act 'as if'. All that panic doesn't pay off. It merely makes it more likely that the people you need to earn trust with will do precisely the opposite.","April 13, 2017","Long-term investment, Panic response, Trust building"

It's worth remembering that we lived in tribes for millennia, long before we learned how to speak. Emotional connection is our default. We only added words and symbolic logic much later.
There are a few places where all that matters is the words. Where the force of logic is sufficient to change the moment.
The rest of the time, which is almost all the time, the real issues are trust, status, culture, pheromones, peer pressure, urgency and the energy in the room.

Guardrails,"A large, freshly-paved parking lot has no boundaries. You can drive in any direction, free to speed to your destination.
But once there's more than a few cars driving, traffic stops. It's too risky, there are too many uncertainties. A car could come at you from any direction, and so we crawl.
Flow is far more efficient, and flow comes from well-placed guardrails and intelligently painted lines. Flow only happens when the guardrails are universally accepted, when we can find the confidence to drive just a bit faster than our eyes can see.
One opportunity to make progress presents itself when it's possible to move a guardrail, to show the others a better route.
The other leap occurs when we realize that we've been imagining a guardrail, one that's been causing us to detour when in fact it's not actually there. We're obeying invisible guardrails when it doesn't benefit the others. Ignoring these self-erected guardrails permits us to contribute more than we thought possible.","April 10, 2017","Guardrails, Flow, Progress"
Who cut down the last tree?,"Easter Island was the home to a thriving community, thousands of people living good lives.
One by one, though, the trees on this isolated island were cut down. They were cut down for fuel, or to make tools, or boats.
And finally, the last tree was gone. And the population went extinct.
Jared Diamond makes the story real in his brilliantarticleandbook.
My question, though, isn't really about the last tree. It's about the second-to-last tree.
When someone cut it down, how did the community react? Were they afraid to speak up? Was it made clear that the social and societal costs of cutting down a tree were severe, so severe that no one would even contemplate cutting down the last tree?
And maybe they could have started this cultural norm with the third-to-last tree. Or even sooner.

If you've seen enough movies, you've probably bought into the homunculus model of AI–that it's in the future and it represents a little mechanical man in a box, as mysterious in his motivations as we are.
The future of AI is probably a lot like the past: it nibbles. Artificial intelligence does a job we weren't necessarily crazy about doing anyway, it does it quietly, and well, and then we take it for granted. No one complained when their thermostat took over the job of building a fire, opening the grate, opening a window, rebuilding a fire. And no one complained when the computer found 100 flights faster and better than we ever could.
But the system doesn't get tired, it keeps nibbling. Not with benign or mal intent, but with a focus on a clearly defined task.
This can't help but lead to unintended consequences, enormous when they happen to you, and mostly small in the universal scheme of things. Technology destroys the perfect and then it enables the impossible.
The question each of us has to ask is simple (but difficult): What can I become quite good at that's really difficult for a computer to do one day soon? How can I become so resilient, so human and such alinchpinthat shifts in technology won't be able to catch up?

Misbelief,"We have a holiday for it, but no good words. Belief in disbelief. The asymmetry between incredulity and credulity. The fact that too often we believe in the wrong stuff, follow the wrong leader and take the wrong medicine.
In just a few decades, we've managed to wreck April Fools as a useful holiday. The stakes are just too high.
For a long time, we've been easily fooled by patent medicines.Snake oilwas a real thing. People used electricity in the wrong places for the wrong illnesses. We swallow silver, see a faith healer and spend all our money for a small bag of magic beans. At the same time, we hesitate to see the doctor, don't talk to her when we do, and fill prescriptions but don't take them when we get home. We're skeptical about vaccines but eagerly line up for oxygenated water…
We believe, but in the wrong things.
When someone tells us a certain kind of person is dangerous, we're too eager to believe our xenophobic instincts. We work ourselves into a frenzy over a small injustice, but stand by when the big scam gets done right in front of our eyes.
And we don't like being wrong.
Hence the paradox, the corner we've painted ourselves into: We need to believe, we want to believe, we benefit from believing. We can't function without news and connection and forward motion.
But, we don't like to be proven wrong.
So it's easy to begin by calling itallfake, by non-believing. To become cynical and short-sighted and brittle.
But non-belief doesn't help, because we can't make forward motion without belief. No society works without trust and optimism.
Which leads us right back where we started, which is the cost of agency and the cost of freedom: the responsibility of believing in things that work. We received leverage and the price is responsibility.
Our job is to see our misbelief and replace it with better belief, thoughtful belief, belief in things that actually work.

An overlooked secret to effectiveness (and happiness),"Knowing where 'enough' is.
More might be better for awhile, but sooner or later, it can'talwaysbe better. Diminishing returns are the law, not an exception.
If we look to advertisers, marketers, bosses, doctors, partners and suppliers to tell us when we've reached 'enough', we're almost certainly going to get it wrong.
It's okay to stop when you're happy.
Is more always better? Sometimes, only better is better…
[Chip asked a friend, a professional, how does he know when to stop making things better. His answer, ""when my budget runs out,"" is a sad commentary on how some of us think about 'enough'. It might let you off the hook, but as a professional, isn't the hook where you want to be?]","May 29, 2017","effectiveness, happiness, enough"
In search of familiarity,"Ask someone what they do, and they'll probably talk about where they work. ""I work in insurance,"" or even, ""I work for Aetna.""
Of course, most of the 47,000 people who work for Aetna don't do anything that's specifically insurance-y. They do security for Building 7, or they answer the phone for someone, or they work in the graphic design department.
Most people have been trained to come to work in search of familiarity and competence. To work with familiar people, doing familiar tasks, getting familiar feedback from a familiar boss. Competence is rewarded, coloring inside the lines is something we were taught in kindergarten.
People will do a bad (a truly noxious) job for a long time because it feels familiar. Legions of people will stick with a dying industry because it feels familiar.
The reason Kodak failed, it turns out, has nothing to do with grand corporate strategy (the people at the top saw it coming), and nothing to do with technology (the scientists and engineers got the early patents in digital cameras). Kodak failed because it was a chemical company and a bureaucracy, filled with people eager to do what they did yesterday.
Change is the unfamiliar.
Change creates incompetence.
In the face of change, the critical questions that leaders must start with are, ""Why did people come to work here today? What did they sign up for?""
That's why it's so difficult tochange the school system. Not because teachers and administrators don't care (they do!). It's because changing the school system isn't what they signed up for.
The solution is as simple as it is difficult: If you want to build an organization that thrives in change (and on change), hire and train people to do the paradoxical: To discover that the unfamiliar is the comfortable familiar they seek. Skiers like going downhill when it's cold, scuba divers like getting wet. That's their comfortable familiar. Perhaps you and your team can view change the same way.","May 28, 2017","Familiarity, Change, Competence"
Predicting or inventing…,"The most common way to deal with the future is to try to predict it. To be in the right place at the right time with the right skills or investments.
A far more successful and reliable approach is toinventthe future. Not all of it, just a little part. But enough to make a difference.","May 27, 2017","Predicting, Inventing, Future"
Microcopy in the age of the glance,"People rarely read to the end. And they almost never spend as much time reading your words as you spend writing them.
Which makes it ironic that the little phrases we use (in designing a simple form, or when we answer the phone) matter so much.
Being gentle, kind or human goes a long way.
Coming across as confident, clear and correct matters as well.
Microcopy is word choice. It's a glimpse of a smile or a slip of impatience.
When you start putting™ trademark symbols in random spots, using extra exclamation points or (this is the biggest one) adopting a false commanding tone and being a jerk in your writing, then you lose us.
We know that you feel like using words like ONLY, NEVER, PERMANENT and NOTICE, but we'd rather hear from someone we like instead.","May 26, 2017","Microcopy, Communication, Tone"
“What about endogeneity?”,"Ask this question often.
Several times a day, at least.
Endogeneity is a fancy term for confusing cause and effect. For not being clear about causation and correlation.
It's one reason why smart people make so many mistakes. We think A leads to B, so more A gets more B. While A and B may have been related in the past, though, it's not at all clear that improving A is going to do anything about B.
There is, for example, an extraordinarily high correlation between per capita cheese consumption and the risk of being strangled by your bedsheets while you sleep:

That doesn't mean that eating lesscheeseis going to help you not die in bed.","May 25, 2017","endogeneity, causation, correlation"
Lowering the bar,"Raymond Loewy coined the termMAYAto describe Most Advanced Yet Acceptable when it came to futuristic design. The thinking goes that people (the amorphous term for the lumpen masses) won't accept something too advanced, so we ought to lower our standards to gain acceptance.
But mass acceptance isn't nearly as important as it used to be. Pockets of commitment and enthusiasm are more important than being tolerated or even accepted by the disinterested masses.
Our hunch is that we need to average things down if we don't want to be rejected, that we need to offer a bit less if we're hoping to make change happen. Mostly, we tell ourselves to dumb things down and pander to people who don't pay attention, are afraid of forward motion and don't care much either.
But the horizontal nature of information flow means that the opposite is now true. We can be as positive and pure and advanced as we can imagine, and some folks will follow.
If we can fall out of love with the quick mass hit, the requirement isn't to lower the bar. It's to make big promises and actually keep them.
Would you have it any other way?","May 24, 2017","MAYA, acceptance, commitment"
Facts are not the antidote for doubt,"Drink enough water and you will cease to be thirsty.
And yet, a doubting person can be drowning in facts, but facts won’t change a mind that doesn’t want to be changed. More facts don’t counter more doubt. Someone who is shaking his head, arms folded, eyes squinted and ears closed isn’t going to be swayed by more facts.
Instead, doubt surrenders to experience. And experience can only happen if there’s enrollment.
If someone is willing to find the right answer, willing to explore what might be effective, what might be confirmable, then enrolling in the journey to ease doubt opens the door to personal experience. Which, magically, can let the light in.
Experience, working it out, touching it, studying it, repeatedly asking why with an open mind… these experiences engage us, earn our attention and gain our trust.
Doubt comes from fear, which is why it’s so difficult to earn enrollment. People don’t want to commit to working their way out of doubt, because doubt is a perverse variation of perceived  safety, a paralysis in the face of the unknown. Earn enrollment first, a commitment to find a path,thenbring on the process and the facts.","May 23, 2017","Doubt, Experience, Enrollment"
Choosing your fuel,"The work is difficult. Overcoming obstacles, facing rejection, exploring the unknown–many of us need a narrative to fuel our forward motion, something to keep us insisting on the next cycle, on better results, on doing work that matters even more.
The fuel you choose, though, determines how you will spend your days. You will spend far more time marinating in your fuel than you will actually doing breakthrough work. Richard Feynman was famously motivated by the joy offiguring things out.His scientific journey (which earned him a Nobel Prize) also provided him with truly wonderful days.
Here is a partial list, in alphabetical order, of narratives light and dark that can serve as fuel to push us to do work that others might walk away from:

Say one thing at a time,"I know, you might not get the microphone back for a while.
And I know, you want to make sure everyone understands precisely what went into your thinking. Not to mention your desire to make sure that everyone who hears you hears something that they'd like to hear.
But if you try to say three things, we will hear nothing. Because most of the time, we're hardly listening.

Three ways to add value,"Tasks, decisions, and initiation…
Doing, choosing, and starting…
Each of the three adds value, but one is more prized than the others.
Tasksare set up for you. Incoming. You use skill and effort to knock em down one at a time and move to the next one.
Decisionsoften overlap with tasks. There are alternatives, and you use knowledge and judgment to pick the best one.
Andinitiationis what happens when you start something out of nothing, break the pattern, launch the new thing and take a leap.
When we think about humans who have made change happen, institutions who have made a difference, cultural shifts that have mattered, we must begin with initiation.
What value-add did you spend yesterday engaged in? How about tomorrow?","May 19, 2017","Value, Initiation, Decision"
Emotional labor,"That’s the labor most of us do now. The work of doing what we don’t necessarily feel like doing, the work of being a professional, the work of engaging with others in a way that leads to the best long-term outcome.
The emotional labor of listening when we’d rather yell.
The emotional labor of working with someone instead of firing them.
The emotional labor of seeking out facts and insights that we don’t (yet) agree with.
The emotional labor of being prepared.
Of course it’s difficult. That’s precisely why it’s valuable. Sometimes, knowing that it’s our job—the way we create value—helps us pause a second and decide to do the difficult work.
Almost no one gets hired to eat a slice of chocolate cake.","May 18, 2017","Emotional labor, professional engagement, difficult work"
What Henry Ford understood about wages,"Every time Ford increased the productivity of car production (in one three-year period, he lowered labor costs by 66% per car), he also raised wages.
Not merely because it’s the right thing to do.
He did it because well-paid workers had more to spend. On houses, on clothes, and of course, on cars.
There’s a positive ratchet here.
You can’t shrink your way to greatness.
When you enable your workers (and your customers) to do more, connect more, produce more and get paid more, you create a positive system. The goal isn’t to clear the table, the goal is to set the table.","May 17, 2017","Wages, Productivity, Positive System"

Stinginess in the connection economy,"When six people are trying to split a pizza, some stinginess appears. After all, more for one person is less for the other five.
But in interactions that lead to connection, to shared knowledge, to possibility, it's pretty clear that there isn't a zero-sum game being played. In fact, the more enthusiasm and optimism people bring to the interaction, the more there is for everyone else.
You don't need to save up the goodwill and encouragement you offer to others. It will be automatically replenished, and it pays dividends along the way.",,"connection economy, stinginess, goodwill"
Groucho runs deep,"Groucho Marx famously said, ""I don't want to be a member of any club that would have me."" Thanks to our connection economy, the membership rolls are now wide open, but theproblemisn't declining.
There are so many communities that want you. So many opportunities to connect, to learn, to leap.
Some communities have skills and want to share them with you. And other ones need you to teach.
In the face of these opportunities, it's easy to say, ""everyone's too smart for me,"" or worse, ""I'm too advanced and I can't learn anything here.""
The full Groucho is believing that you don't deserve to learn and you're not entitled to teach.
Of course, that's merely a form of hiding. Because connection leads to learning and learning leads to change and change is frightening. Easier, it seems, to push the opportunities away, say your Groucho Marx line and go back to doing what you were doing.
If you weren't afraid of change, what could you learn?
And if you weren't afraid of rejection, what would you teach?

When time catches up,"And it always does.
Bad decisions happen for one of two reasons:
A. You're in a huge hurry and you can't process all the incoming properly. But more common…
B. The repercussions of your decision won't happen for months or years. This is why we don't save for retirement, don't pay attention to long-term environmental issues, and, tragically, tolerate (or fall prey to) irrational rants about things like vaccines. It might be engaging or soothing to promote a palliative idea now, but years later, when innocent kids aresick and dying, the regrets are real.
A bad decision isn't only bad because we're uninformed or dumb. It can be bad because we are swayed by short-term comfort and ignore long-term implications. A bad decision feels good in the short run, the heartfelt decision of someone who means well. But there's a gap when we get to the long run.
Eula Biss has written a beautiful, honestbookabout this gap. About how we can fall into the trap of being well-meaning, emotional and loud in the short run, but how the truth of time changes the way we see things.
Our job as leaders (and we all are, in our own way) is to elevate the long run on behalf of those we care about, regardless how hard the marketing and tribal noise around us encourages to fall prey to instant comfort.

Possibility,"This is not the same as reality. But without belief in the possibility, your reality is going to be severely curtailed.
We must avoid the temptation to begin with an analysis of what's easy, or what's probable, or even likely.
We can only do our work justice by examining what's possible, and then deciding if we care enough to pursue it.",,"possibility, belief, reality"
Tension vs. fear,"Fear's a dream killer. It puts people into suspended animation, holding their breath, paralyzed and unable to move forward.
Fear is present in many education settings, because fear's a cheap way to ensure compliance. ""Do this,"" the teacher threatens, ""or something bad is going to happen to you.""
The thing is, learning is difficult. If it was easy, you'd already know everything you need to know. And if you could do it on your own, you wouldn't need the time or expense to do it with others.
But when we try to learn something on our own, we often get stuck.
It's not because of fear, it's because of tension.
The tension we face any time we're about to cross a threshold. The tension ofthis might workvs.this might not work. The tension ofif I learn this, will I like who I become?
Tension is the hallmark of a great educational experience. The tension of not quite knowing where we are in the process, not being sure of the curriculum, not having a guarantee that it's about to happen.
As adults, we willingly expose ourselves to the tension of a great jazz concert, or a baseball game or a thrilling movie. But, mostly because we've been indoctrinated by fear, we hesitate when we have the opportunity to learn something new on our way to becoming the person we seek to be.
Effective teachers have the courage to create tension. And adult learners on their way to levelling up actively seek out this tension, because it works. It pushes us over the chasm to the other side.
I've been running thealtMBAfor nearly two years, and in that time we've seen tens of thousands of people consider the workshop. Some of them see the tension coming and eagerly dive in. Others mistake that tension for fear and back away, promising themselves that they'll sign up later.
The ones who leapt are transformed. The tension pays off.
We're proud of the tension. We built it into the workshop from the start, because education is never about access to information, it's about the forward motion of learning.
You already know this workshopworks. That's easy to check out. The hesitation comes from this very fact… that it works. That a change occurs. That the unknown is right over there, and to get yourself there, you have to walk through a month's worth of tension.
That's the best way I know to learn. And so that's the way we teach.

PS there are only two more sessions of thealtMBAthis year. Embrace the tension and apply in time for tomorrow's early priority deadline.","May 10, 2017","Tension, Fear, Learning"

Pre-existing conditions,"We all have them.
By the time we get this far, we've got bangs and bruises, things that don't work quite right, experiences that have shaped us, sometimes for the worse.
It starts early. We're all born with them and into them. Sometimes we get lucky and we're surrounded by positive role models and people who believe in us, and other times we're stuck in an uphill climb that's unfair and unproductive.

And we just had a winner,"The local market has a sign that says, ""There was a $500 Lotto winner here…""
A cursory knowledge of statistics will help you see that this doesn't matter. It doesn't make it more likely or less likely that they'll have a winner today or even tomorrow.
And yet…
And yet sales go up after a big win. And to veer to the tragic, when a friend is struck with a serious disease, we're more likely to go to the doctor.
Because proximity is truth.
The truth of experience, the truth of immediacy, the truth of it might just happen to me.
That's why the media has been such a powerful force, because it brings the distant much closer.
And why small communities of interest and connection are still the dominant force in our culture. Because people like us, do things like this.","May 6, 2017","Lotto, statistics, media"
Defending myself (vs. offending my self),"The reason it's difficult to learn something new is that it will change you into someone who disagrees with the person you used to be.
And we're not organized for that.
The filter bubble and our lack of curiosity about the unknown are forms of self defense. We're defending the self, keeping everything ""ok"" because that's a safe, low maintenance place to be.
The alternative is to sign up for a lifetime of challenging what the self believes. A journey to find more effectiveness, not more stability.

The self-healing letter of complaint,"You’ve been wronged. The service was terrible. You went unseen, disrespected and abused. You didn’t get your money’s worth. The software is sloppy, the people were rude, the entire experience was lousy.
A letter to the organization is called for. At the very least, you’ll get an apology, some free samples, and maybe, just maybe, they’ll fix the problem for everyone who comes after you. How generous of you to dig in and share the vitriol.
Better put a sharp point on it, personalize it and make it sting.
Here’s the thing: Every angry word you write is only going to confirm the story you’re already telling yourself, the story that’s still making you miserable. The more spite you put into the note, the worse you’re going to feel. You’ll relive the event again and again. And, it’s pretty certain, if a human reads the note, they’ll now feel lousy too. They might go home and kick their dog, it’s that visceral.
To what end? Is it going to increase the chances that change happens?
Here’s a different tack, a selfish one that pays off for everyone involved:
Write the most positive note you can imagine. Write about how much the brand/service/government agency means to you. Let them know just how much you trust them, how much they’ve helped you in the past. Lay it on thick, that’s okay, it’ll remind you of why you care in the first place, and it will build bridges instead of tearing them down.
Then, say, “Here’s what didn’t work” or “But I have an important suggestion…”
And, without adding the hurt and anger that you feel, explain what went wrong. Explain it clearly, in a useful way, but give the reader the benefit of the doubt. Assume she knows that it didn’t make you happy, that it completely ruined your wedding, that you’re never ever going to return. Just leave that part out.
After all, if you didn’t care about them, you wouldn’t bother writing a letter, would you?

When we understand,"Modern marketing, the craft of getting ideas to spread, has split.
On one side are the roboticists. They test and measure and do what works. They do it with no interest in how people decide or what they believe or what story they tell themselves. Instead, they treat the human as an ant in an ant farm, a robot that does this or that. They're behaviorists.
On the other are those that seek to get to the heart of what makes us human. These marketers know that fear, shame, desire for gain and culture are the quartet that drive just about every decision. They know that Milton Friedman and Ayn Rand couldn't have been more wrong, and that truly understanding our narratives is the essence of doing work that matters, that connects, and that spreads.
There are ever more tools for folks who do the former, but the problem is that this is work that gets easier to automate and easier to hire for.
On the other hand, the ranks of people who understand, who understand well enough to lead, to decide and most of all, to see… there are never enough of these people doing the work that matters.
It takes patience and effort (but not focus groups) to develop this empathy. It's worth it.

The thing about bananas,"About half of all the bananas consumed worldwide come from the same tree.
Not the sametypeof tree. The very same tree. TheCavendish, which has no seeds, is propagated by grafting or cloning. Which means that they're all identical. If you're a mass marketer, pushing everyone to expect and like the very same thing, a thing with no variation and little surprise, this is good news indeed.
Until, of course, a fungus comes along and wipes out the entire monoculture.
It's tempting to want all your bananas to be the same. To have all your employees be clones of one another, your products to be indistinguishable commodities, each conforming to the dominant narrative of the day.
And if you're a freelancer, you're under huge pressure to be just like everyone else. It's easier to talk about what you do, easier to fit in, easier to be ignored.
But variation brings resilience and innovation and the chance to make a difference.","May 1, 2017","bananas, monoculture, variation"
Two confusions,"Those things you're bad at? You're not nearly as bad at them as you fear.
And those things you're great at? Probably not nearly as good as you hope.
We beat ourselves up a lot, but often focus on the wrong areas, avoiding the soft spots and doubling down on the places where we are well armored.
Mirrors are a fairly new invention. For millennia, we had little idea what we looked like. And only in the last two generations have people had any clue about what they sounded like. Today, even though we're surrounded by sound, video and light reflecting on us, not to mention comments and the social media maelstrom, we're still quite bad at self-judgment.

Four ways to improve customer service,"You've probably guessed that the most valuable one, the fourth, is also far and away the most difficult to create. Culture is a posture that lasts. It's corroded by shortcuts and by inattention, and fed by constant investment and care.

Creating discomfort,"If you're seeking to create positive change in your community, it's almost certain you'll be creating discomfort as well.
Want to upgrade the local playground? It sounds like it will be universally embraced by parents and everyone who cares about kids. Except that you now bring up issues of money, of how much is enough, of safety. Change is uncomfortable.
It's way easier to talk about today's weather, or what you had for lunch.
Usually, when we're ready to launch something, we say, ""this is going to help people, this is well crafted, I'm proud of it.""
What's a lot more difficult (but useful) is to say all of that plus, ""and this is going to make (some) people uncomfortable.""","June 28, 2017","discomfort, change, community"
Worth reconsidering?,"The status quo is powerful indeed. We add layers, patches and small improvisations, all to shore up something we don't want to reconsider.
If we had a clean sheet of paper, and could design something that actually worked, what would we do about:

If you don't offer someone a raise until they find a new job and quit, don't be surprised if your employees start looking for new jobs.

“Is judgment involved?”,"No judgment, no responsibility.
No responsibility, no risk.
There's a fork in the road. If you seek out roles without responsibility, you might just find a sinecure.
This is the hot job for undifferentiated job seekers at the placement office, the job where a famous company will tell you what to do all day.
Alas, those are the jobs that will be deleted first. The jobs that come with little in the way of respect or stability. These are the jobs that big companies automate whenever they can, or create enough rules to avoid any variation if they can't.
The other choice is a job loaded with judgment calls. One where it's extremely likely you'll make a decision you regret, and get blamed for it. One where you take responsibility instead of waiting for authority.

Staring at the numbers,"Sometimes, you can learn a lot by watching. But not always.
An alien observing our behavior in elevators would note that most of the time, a person gets in, approaches the front corner, leaves that corner, goes to the back and then stands silently, staring at the numbers above the door.
Only one of those actions is actually required. If you don't push the button (or have someone push it for you) nothing happens. The rest—the moving to the back, standing silently and most of all, staring at the numbers—it's just for show, a cultural tradition.
Most practices work this way. From eating in restaurants to marketing, we add all sorts of extraneous motion to our effort. Which is fine, unless you don't understand which ones actually matter to the outcome.
Too often, we train people in the motions without giving them understanding. Then, when the world changes, we're stuck staring at the numbers going by, unable to find the insight to push a new kind of button.","June 22, 2017","behavior, understanding, cultural tradition"
Worth being afraid of,"We're pretty good at finding demons to be afraid of.
It turns out, though, that the one who usually lets us down is us.
Our unwillingness to leap, to commit, to trust our own abilities.
It's the internal narrative that seeks disaster just as much as it craves reassurance.

All it takes is effort,"Customer service used to be a great divide. Well-off companies would heavily invest in taking care of customers, others would do the minimum (or a bit less). Of course, back then, organizations couldn't possibly give you all the service you might dream of. They can't all afford to answer the phone on one ring, it's expensive to hire enough operators and train them. And they certainly can't dedicate an operator just to you, someone who would know your history and recognize your voice.
Today, though, when more and more of our engagements are digital, it doesn't take an endless, ongoing budget to delight people. All an organization needs to do is care enough (once) to design it properly.
To make a process that is easy to use, clearly labeled and well designed.
To build a phone system that doesn't torture you and then delete everything you typed in.
To put care into every digital interaction, even if it's easier to waste the user's time.
[Insert story here of healthcare company, cable company or business that doesn't care enough to do it right. One where the committees made the process annoying. Or where the team didn't cycle one more time. Or where the urgency of the moment takes attention away from the long-term work of system design.  The thing is, if one company can do the tech right, theneveryorganization with sufficient resources and motivation can do the tech right.]
The punchline is simple: In consumer relations and service,good tech is free.
It's free because it pays for itself in lower overhead and great consumer satisfaction and loyalty.
But it requires someone to care enough to do it right.

Winner take all,"Really?
Almost nothing in our daily lives is actually a winner take all competition.
Somewhere, there's someone fitter, faster, thinner, quicker, smarter, more popular or richer than you. And there's someone else fitter, faster, thinner, quicker, smarter, more popular or richer than they are. And you're (far) ahead of someone else who is busy looking at you from behind.
And yet we see people angry because someone's passing their car, or gaining more followers online. They mistakenly believe it's a race. It rarely is.

Blame Charles Mochet,"The standards of your industry and our culture were set a long time ago. So long ago that we often forget why… we forget and then we fail to change them.
In 1934, the rules of bike racing were changed to ban recumbent bicycles. And that rule has stood for more than 80 years, becauseCharles Mochetmade the mistake of giving his faster, safer bike to a cyclist who wasn't respected. To preserve the status of existing riders who had paid their dues, the governing bodies banned the bike forever.
All of those riders are now dead, but the rule persists.

It's all legitimate, it's all real. Don't hold back.
On the other list, write down the privileges, advantages and opportunities you have:
Now, take one list and put it in a drawer. Take the other list and tape it up on your bathroom mirror. Read the list in the drawer once a month or once a year, just to remind you that it's safe and sound. Read the other list every day.

Mental load and the worry cache,"It’s well known that the team that wins an Olympic relay isn’t the fastest at running or swimming—it’s the team that handles the handoffs the best.
The same thing is true of your job. The tasks could be done by many people, but someone who is great at your job embraces the mental effort necessary to do task switching, to read between the lines, to keep many balls going at the same time. Strategy and tactics both.
Sometimes, we think that these are the things that get in the way of our work. In fact, theyarethe work.
Writing a sentence is easy. Deciding what to write in the next sentence is hard.
Making decisions is exhausting. It involves perception and analysis and most of all, taking responsibility. Pretending to lead and manage is a trivial task, because there’s no, “what if?”
It turns out that the mental load of management is primarily around experiencing failure.
Actual failure, sure, but mostly potential failure. Imagining failure in advance. All the current things that could go wrong. And more important, the things you’re not doing that will be obvious oversights later. Our brains work overtime to cycle through these, to learn to see around corners, to have the guts to delegate without doing the work ourselves (even though that creates more imagined points of failure). Scan, touch, consider, analyze, repeat.
The other thing that’s a huge load:Worry. Unlike all the things I’ve already mentioned, worry isn’t actually part of your job. Worry (expressed through non-productive pessimistic cycles over things out of your control) is antithetical to the work you’ve agreed to do.

Gorilla marketing,"The late Jay Levinson created the Guerrilla Marketing series. I was lucky enough to work with him early in the arc, producing four of them.
One of the core tenets of the books was that marketing was no longer merely the work of giant organizations with giant budgets. That in fact, it was possible to spread an idea with care, guts and effort, not just with money. We wanted people, particularly small businesses, to see that they could be marketers too.
Well, that's no longer a problem. In fact, it's swung so far the other way that we have a new problem.
When marketing was expensive, it was done with care. Not only by committees that worked hard to keep things consistent, but by creators who thought deeply about their long-term reputation.
Today, because noise is everywhere, we're all surrounded by a screaming horde, an open-outcry marketplace of ideas where the race to be heard appears to be the only race that matters. And so subtlety flies out the window, along with a desire to engage for the long haul. Just a troop of gorillas, all arguing over the last remaining banana.
It turns out that there's a useful response… to ignore them. To stick to the work, to thesmallestpossible audience, to building something worth talking about.
What actually works in a noisy environment isn't more noise—it's the challenging work of earning the benefit of people telling people.

76 people who saw this interview took the time to give it a thumbs down. The interviewer flew across the world and shared his work for free, but 76 people hated it enough to affirmatively vote it down.
Of course, 1% of 108,000 is about a thousand. This is less than a tenth of that.

Accelerating revolutions,"Four hundred years ago, almost no one on Earth had tasted coffee. It was too difficult to move things a few thousand miles.
A hundred years ago, if you wanted a cold drink in the summer or needed to ice an injured knee, you were largely out of luck. It took millions of years of cultural and technical evolution to get to the point where people had a freezer in their house.
The industrial revolution was mighty indeed. It paved the Earth, created the middle class and changed everything. And it was a powerhouse for generations, incrementally changing what hadn't been changed yet.
The TV revolution followed, introducing mass marketing as a force that could change our culture.
Then, the 60s brought the computer revolution, which involved large devices capable of sorting, calculating and processing things that were previously unsorted.
We're living right now in the connection revolution, one powered by the internet, in which people connect to people, computers connect to computers and our culture changes ever faster, daily.
The next two revolutions are right around the corner:
The biology revolution, which has had some fits and starts, will transform our bodies and our planet. Once computers are able to see, understand and modify living things, the same acceleration of the last three revolutions will kick in.
And the AI revolution, in which we engage with computers as much as with each other, is showing itself now too.
Faster, ever faster. Moore's law ratchets technology, technology changes the culture, the culture changes the economy and it continues.

In the moment, walking out is precisely the best short-term strategy. Sometimes this place is too hard, too unpleasant, too much…
The thing is, though, that the long-term strategy might be the opposite. The best long-term approach might be to learn something, to tough it out, to engage with the challenge. Because once you get through this, you'll be different. Better.

Off the hook with Milton Friedman,"Nearly fifty years ago, Milton Friedman published a polemic, an article that altered the way many people think about corporations and their role in society. Countless writers have explained why it’spoorly reasoned,dangerousandwrong. (Including business school deans, Harvard Business Review and Fortune).
The simple message of the simple article was: “there is one and only one social responsibility of business – to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits…”
Friedman does add a parenthetical, “so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud,” but it’s clear that his emphasis is on the first part.
Businesses, he argues, should show no corporate responsibility, do nothing to further the goals of an ethical society, do nothing to improve the lives of customers, employees or bystanders—unlessthese actions coincidentally maximize profits.
An interesting question that most people haven’t focused on: why did this dangerous idea catch on and stick around so long?
Here it is 2017, and the Chairman of one of the largest pharma companies in the country isgleefullytelling patients and the FDA to live with the costs of his profit seeking, at the same time he pays his CEO more than $95 million a year. Because he can, and, like many who lucked into top jobs at big companies, because his excuse is simple: He’s just doing his job.
If the idea is so wrong, if it leads to an erosion of the social contract and the deaths of innocent kids, why are we still discussing it?
Because it’s simple, because it diminishes responsibility, and because it comes with prizes and warm chocolate cookies for those in charge.
The simplicity of the argument matches up with its mendacity. There’s no need to worry about nuance, no need to lose sleep over choices, no endless laundry list of social ills to worry about. Just make more profit.
Do this, get that.
A simple compass, a north star, a direction to go that absolves the employee/boss of responsibility for anything complicated or nuanced.
People love mechanical simplicity, especially when it benefits them.
The official rules of baseball are more than 250 pages long. Why? Because working the system, cutting corners and winning at all costs long ago replaced playing by the spirit of the game. Since the league can’t count on people to act like people acting on behalf of the community, they have to create ever more rules to keep the system in check.
The problem is far worse in a supposed free market. When humans stop acting like humans and instead indicate that they have no choice but to seek every short-term benefit and cut every possible corner, we can no longer trust each other to act responsibly.
Off the hook feels like a simple way out. “I’m just doing my job, and not thinking hard about the side effects (or to be more accurate, the effects) of my actions. Not only that, but one of the things that’s part of my job is lobbying to have fewer rules. Because working the refs is good business. And because everyone is doing it, I have no choice but to do it too.”
Of course, it’s difficult for us to solely blame poor Milton. Lots of us have bad ideas, I’ve certainly had plenty. No, we need to blame ourselves for letting selfish corporate officers get away with this reasoning. When we go to work, or partner with, or buy stock in a company that signs up for Milton reasoning, we’re rewarding people who have long ago stopped acting like people.
Profits are fine, they enable the investment we need to produce value. But almost nothing benefits from being the only thing we seek, and the pursuit of profit at the expense of our humanity is too high a price to pay.
Here’s a different version: A business is a construct, an association of human beings combining capital and labor to make something. That business has precisely the same social responsibilities as the people that it consists of. The responsibility to play fairly, to see the long-term impacts of its actions and to create value for all those it engages with.

Thinking clearly about quality,"There are at least three ways we use the word ‘quality’ at work:
Qualityas defined by Deming andCrosby:Meeting spec.
If you can reliably, and without drama, deliver precisely what you have promised, this is quality. This is what happens when a car, regardless of price, has doors that don’t squeak. Or when a website doesn’t go down. Or when your dry cleaning is ready on the day it’s promised, and your clothes are clean.
When six sigma professionals talk about quality, this is what they mean. Meeting spec.
Qualityas defined by Ralph Lauren or Tiffany:The quality of deluxeness.
This is when the clarity of the diamond or the nap of the leather or the speed of the jet is something that most others can’t match. This is not just, “you get what you pay for,” but also, “you paid a lot.”
And finally, there’s thequalityofright effort, of “I did my best,” of the sweat and vulnerability that happens when a human has given it her all.
That TV show or that software that you love: what do you love about it? What about the calculus you put into shopping for a car or a school for your kids?
A $100 million-dollar movie might have more spectacular special effects or be more carefully edited, but it might not have the quality that you find in an indie film.
When you’re doing your work, when you’re creating an offering, there’s no more important question to answer than, “what sort of quality are we seeking here?”

Anti-glib: Knowing what you’re talking about,"Glibness is a disease that's particularly virulent in Silicon Valley, politics, entertainment and the executive suite. Someone has an insight (or gets lucky) and then amasses power. Surrounded by more than they're willing to understand, they substitute the glib statement, the smirk, the cutting remark. They turn everything into a status-fueled professional wrestling match.
It's usually done out of fear, and, ironically, the fear-induced glib approach merely makes things worse, creating even more fear.
The alternative is to know what you're talking about.
To have done the reading. [I've seen this problem in boardrooms, examination rooms and classrooms across the planet].
To be able to hold conflicting ideas in your head as you consider options.
To know and respect the people who have earned a place at the table of ideas.
To have energetic engagements with people who are more experienced, wiser and more connected than you are.
To admit that you were wrong, because you didn't know what you know now, and then to chart a new path.
To ignore sunk costs when making new decisions.
The fans of professional wrestling (in all its forms) are entertained by the glib, because it releases them from the obligation to understand metaphor, to look more deeply, to engage with a logical argument.
Everyone else would rather work with people who know what they're talking about, who respect those they work with and most of all, who seek useful outcomes, not just the comfort of a short-term win.

Sham surgery,"The datashowsthat more than 600,000 people got arthroscopic knee surgery in the US in 2010. It's expensive and painful.
It turns out that sham surgery works just as well. That just about as many people would have found pain relief from this procedure if they had experienced fake surgery instead.
In an extensive study of elective surgeries (asthma, obesity, Parkinson’s disease, acid reflux and back pain) it was found thatmore than half the time, people would have had at least a good an outcome if they had only experienced fake surgery instead of the real kind.
That's worth a pause.
Same operating room, same gowns, same perception of pain–but no actual surgery.Halfthe people would have gotten better, which is awfully close to the number that got better from the real thing.
(Even if this number is twice as high as you are comfortable with, it tells us something dramatic about the power of suggestion).
If you don't think marketing works, and you're wondering about the power of theplacebo, that's all the evidence you should need. That sham surgery on knee pain is virtually as effective as the real kind. Which means it's not a sham at all, is it?
Of course, placebos work on far more than knees. They work on the taste of wine, the effectiveness of coaching and how well we perform at work.

And then we'll turn this into a doubleheader, at 2 pm segueing the Facebook Live into a conversation about thriving as a change agent in a big company, part of what people learn in thealtMBA.

How much does a ton weigh?,"It's not unusual to describe a heavy object in tonnage.
But no one has any idea how much a ton is, really. Is 250 tons a lot? How much?
250 tons is 500,000 pounds. About the weight of 8 houses. Or the weight of 100,000 bricks.
Which is a solid stack of bricks 10 x 10 by 1,000 bricks high.
It would take you more than 2 months, working 24 hours a day, a brick a minute, to unload that many bricks.
Facts are facts, but images resonate.",,"ton weight, heavy objects, bricks"
Toward dumber,"If you want to reach more people, if you're measuring audience size, then the mantra of the last twenty years has been simple: make it dumber.
Use clickbait headlines. Short sentences. Obvious ideas. Little nuance. Don't make people uncomfortable or ask them to stretch. Remind them that they were right all along. Generate a smile or a bit of indignation. Most of all, dumb it down.
And it works.
For a while.
And then someone comes along who figures out how to take your version of dumbness and go further than you were willing to go. Until everything becomes the National Enquirer.
While this downward cycle of dumb continues to be passed from hand to hand, a few people headed in the other direction. Measuring not the size of the audience, but their engagement, their commitment and the change that was possible.
This is an upward cycle, a slow one, a journey worth going on.
Dumber is an intentional act, a selfish trade for mass. It requires us to hold something back, to avoid creating any discomfort, to fail to teach. Dumber always works in the short run, but not in the long run.
Don't confuse dumber with simpler. Simpler removes the unnecessary and creates a better outcome as a result. But dumber does little but create noise.
Everyone owns a media company now. Even media companies. And with that ownership comes a choice, a choice about the people we serve, the words we use and the change we seek to make.
It's only a race to the bottom if we let it be one.","July 20, 2017","dumbing down, audience engagement, media ethics"
The express and the local,"Express trains run less often, make fewer stops, and if they're going where you're going, get you there faster.
The local train is, of course, the opposite.
Some people hop on the first train that comes. A local in the hand is worth the extra time, they say, because you're never quite sure when the express is going to get there.
On the other hand, there's a cost to investing in the thing that pays off in the long run.
Now that you see that, you're probably going to notice it in 100 areas of your life.
The local requires less commitment, feels less risky, doesn't demand a point of view. The express, on the other hand, always looks like a better idea after you've embraced it and gotten to where you meant to go.
Express or local?","July 19, 2017","Express trains, local trains, commitment"
Gaztelugatxe,"There's an island off the coast of Spain that houses a church. The church has 230 steps to the top, and it's said that it's worth the climb.
What a great expression. Gaztelugatxe can now mean, ""it's a lot of effort, but worth it.""
The opposite of fast and easy but worthless.

The ethics of FTD,"When you order flowers online, they're usually delivered by a local florist.
Which means the florist has a dilemma:
He can deliver his very best effort and the most beautiful flowers he has in stock, even though the sender will never know his identity or buy from him again.
Or he can use up the damaged stock and the fading flowers, confident that the sender will never know his identity or buy from him again.
You can average up or average down.
You can hide or you can show pride.
It turns out that the florist who doesn't use up the damaged stock and the fading flowers never seems to have trouble affording better stuff.","July 17, 2017","florist ethics, flower delivery, quality vs. quantity"
In search of enrollment,"Back in the day, hitchhikers held cardboard signs with their desired destination city clearly written out. After all, if you're headed to New York, it doesn't make sense to pick up someone headed for Denver (it's a bad idea for the driverandthe passenger).
If you've got people on your bus who are headed somewhere you have no intention of going, today might be a good day for them to get off the bus.","July 16, 2017","enrollment, hitchhiking, destination"
Strength through peace,"Anticipating doom is brutal. And anticipating brutality is even worse.
It creates an enormous amount of emotional overhead. It makes it difficult to invest, hard to make long-term plans. And it fills us with dread, short circuiting our creativity.
Peace has a dividend. Economic peace, political peace, interpersonal peace. It gives us room to dream, to get restless and to make things even better.
We don't need other people to lose in order for us to win. And keeping score is overrated.
Most of all, it's worth investing in peace of mind. The dividends are huge, and the journey (the way each of us spend our days) matters.
That's one of the primary benefits of enlightened leadership. It creates a safe space to do important work.","July 15, 2017","Peace, Leadership, Emotional Well-being"
Permission abused is permission lost,"It doesn't matter what your privacy policy says, it doesn't matter when your quarterly results are due and it doesn't matter what the database is telling you…
If someone doesn't want to hear from you anymore, you've lost the ability to reach them.
Yes, you can go back to trying to interrupt them, but of course, that's getting more and more expensive.
Permission is valuable and permission is fragile.","July 14, 2017","permission, privacy, communication"
The two fears of voluntary education,"Voluntary education is different from compulsory, the kind we grew up with.
When you're the victim/beneficiary of compulsory education, it happenstoyou. You have little choice. Perhaps you choose to open your mind and do the work, but either way, here it is.
Now that we're adults, though, we have choice. Endless choice. Most people choose to learn as little as possible, while a few dive in and find more insight, wisdom and opportunity than they could ever expect. Why do so many people hold back?
The truth is that you don't need a license, experience or skill to run a course online. You can post videos, write blog posts and generally just show up and announce you're teaching something.
As a result, there's a lot of reason for the buyer to beware. The student who spends time and money on a course that doesn't work feels stupid, even stupider than they did before they began. Hopes aren't realized and the disappointment in being ripped off is real.
The second reason is a bit more surprising…
This is real, it's disappointing, and it's also the biggest reason people hesitate. We hesitate precisely because the course might deliver what it promises. Because a new experience, a workshop, an event might show you something you can't unsee. It might lead to forward motion, to new opportunities and to change.
But change brings risk and risk brings fear. Those new horizons, those new opportunities, those new skills–they might not be as comfortable as what you've got going on right now.
And so the challenge. We choose not to learn because it's either going to fail (embarrassing and expensive) or it's going to work (frightening). We get ourselves stuck between a rock and a hard place of inaction.
The door is open to be heroic. To go on the journey from a place of fear. Not to wait for the fear to go away before you begin, but instead to begin precisely because there is fear.
Those that have successfully come before us have figured out how to make this leap. To feel (and embrace) these fears, not to deny them, and to dig in because and despite.
[As you might have guessed, I see this firsthand when I talk about the two workshops I run. Workshops that actually do what they promise. Tomorrow, Friday the 14th, is the last day for first priority applications for thealtMBAfall session.  Andthe Marketing Seminarhas just about a week before we close the doors for the last scheduled session.]
The biggest hesitation is the fear of an open door.
The biggest challenge is the question we ask ourselves:Thenwhat will I do?
That's why we're so eager to tweak the little things. Because the little things give us a little more of the same thing that we're already used to.
Hope to see you leap. Because it might work.","July 13, 2017","voluntary education, fear of change, personal growth"
In search of the minimum viable audience,"Of course everyone wants to reach the maximum audience. To be seen by millions, to maximize return on investment, to have a huge impact.
And so we fall all over ourselves to dumb it down, average it out, pleasing everyone and anyone.
You can see the problem.
When you seek to engage with everyone, you rarely delight anyone. And if you’re not the irreplaceable, essential, one-of-a-kind changemaker, you never get a chance to engage with the market.
The solution is simple but counterintuitive: Stake out the smallest market you can imagine. The smallest market that can sustain you, the smallest market you can adequately serve. This goes against everything you learned in capitalism school, but in fact, it’s the simplest way to matter.
When you have your eyes firmly focused on the minimum viable audience, you will double down on all the changes you seek to make. Your quality, your story and your impact will all get better.
And then, ironically enough, the word will spread.
Focusing on the MVA is a key part of what we teach inThe Marketing Seminar.(Look for the purple circle).
It’s easy to talk about in the abstract, but difficult to put into practice. Just about every brand you care about, just about every organization that matters to you–this is how they got there. By focusing on just a few and ignoring the non-believers, the uninvolved and the average.","July 12, 2017","Minimum Viable Audience, Focused Marketing, Niche Engagement"
A shared and useful illusion,"Ask a frog or a housefly or a dog to describe the world around us and they'll give you the wrong answer. The frog will talk about moving objects, the housefly will describe things repeated hundreds of times and the dog only sees in black and white.
Of course, our vision of the world is just as flawed, just as fake. We can't see the smells, as the dog does, nor can we visualize things on the edges of the spectrum. We make up a reality based on our particular way of seeing the world.
But, here's the good part: That made-up reality is shared by many people around us, and it's useful. We can use it to make predictions about what's next, we can avoid bumping into people, we can appreciate a sunset.
If the illusion is working for you, stick with it.
Where we run into trouble is when the vision isn't shared, when we assume others can and must see what we're seeing, but they don't. And worse, when the vision isn't actually useful, when our narrative of the world around us isn't working, when it's merely a fantasy, not a tool.
If the way you see the world isn't helping you make the changes you seek to make, consider seeing the world differently.","July 11, 2017","illusion, perception, reality"
"Drip, drip, drip","Who do you subscribe to?
And who subscribes to you?
Those simple questions determine what you know and what you learn. And they influence whether a business or a charity will succeed, and whether or not lives will be changed.
Newspapers are discovering that without subscribers, they can't do their work. Online voices that were seduced by the promise of a mass audience are coming back to the realization that the ability to deliver their message to people who want to get it is actually the core of their model.
Big hits are thrilling. Launch days, deadlines, the big win… That's easy to sign up for as a creator or marketer. But subscriptions are what work.
Netflix, HBO, Amazon Prime… subscriptions. This blog wouldn't exist without the people who trust me enough to read it every day.
Consider the case of charities. If they raise money from consumers, they get almost their entire budget in the last month of the year, or related to some sort of external event. And most people who donate never do so again. Out of sight, out of mind.
Who do you subscribe to?
Who subscribes to you?
Seven years ago, I dedicated my annual birthday post to raising money for charity:water. 665 generous readers like you ended up contributing more than $39,000. Enough water to impact the lives of 3,000 people. On their behalf, thank you.
Five years after that, we did it again, but this time I encouraged my readers (people like you) to donatetheirbirthdays to charity:water. 204 of you raised more than $50,000 and saved even more lives. And again, thank you.
This year, I'm hoping 1,000 people will subscribe to charity:water today. A monthly drip, the best possible pun, drip, drip, drip in a way that not only becomes a habit but gives the organization a chance to plan, because thirst doesn't have a season. Every month becomes your birthday, because you're giving a magical present, paying it forward. I just subscribed for $4,000 a month. If more than 500 of you subscribe at any amount (even $6), I'll double my monthly commitment.
Scott and his teammade a film and built a site. You can skip the film if you're busy, but don't skip the box at the bottom of the page.

But what if you’re doing it wrong?,"Marketing doesn't have to suck.
It doesn't have to be a miserable experience for consumers, and it certainly doesn't have to be a distasteful, creepy or annoying task for the creator.
We don't have to market at people, pin them to the wall, target them, track them, stalk them, trick them, manipulate them and sell them things they don't want.
Not if we care enough to do something better.
The other kind of marketing, the marketing that's consensual, useful and effective, is possible. This is marketing that we eagerly connect with, marketing that we'd miss if it were gone.
I call this modern marketing, and it's easier than ever to do this effectively.
The second edition ofThe Marketing Seminarlaunches today. It's a special summer school program, compressing the 100-day process into just 30 days.
The first session worked beautifully. Thousands of people were transformed by the combination of 50 videos and (more importantly) thousands and thousands of direct online discussions in our 24/7 discussion board. You learn by asking and you learn by teaching.
If you're ready to love what you do and have it work better than ever, I'm hoping you'll check out the Seminar.

Caring is free,"In the short run, of course, not caring can save you some money.
Don't bother making the facilities quite so clean. Save time and hassle and let the display get a little messy. Don't worry so much about one particular customer, because you're busy and hiring more people takes time and money.
But in the long run, caring pays for itself.
Caring is expensive, but it also generates loyalty and word of mouth.
In the long run, an organization that puts in extra effort gets rewarded.
Not to mention that caring makes us all more human. Worth it.","July 8, 2017","Caring, Loyalty, Long-term Benefits"
The rationality paradox,"If you see yourself as an engineer, a scientist, or even a person of logic, then it's entirely possible that you work to make rational decisions, decisions that lead to the outcomes you seek.
The paradox is that you might also believe that you do this all the time, and that others do it too.
But a rational analysis shows that this is far from true. Almost every choice we make is subconscious. We're glitch-ridden, superstitious creatures of habit. We are swayed by social forces that are almost always greater than our attraction to symbolic logic would indicate. We prioritize the urgent and most of the decisions we make don't even feel like decisions. They're mostly habits combined with a deep desire to go along with the people we identify with.
Every time you assume that others will be swayed by your logical argument, you've most likely made a significant, irrational mistake.
Your actions and your symbols and your tribe dwarf the words you use to make your argument.","July 7, 2017","rationality, subconscious decisions, social influences"
Does it help?,"Isn't this the essence of design thinking?
I have a great wool hat that I wear in the winter. Does it help?
Well, that depends on what it's for.
If it's designed to keep me warm, then yes, it helps.
How about that meeting you're going to, that website you're updating, that question you're about to ask?
What's it for?
Does it help?
If it doesn't help, or you don't know what it's for, perhaps it's time to revisit your choice.

Simple approach to the things you check,"The data, the dashboard, the comments, the statuses, the likes, the rankings:
Check them half as often and do twice as much with what you learn.

The cost of independence,"Freedom comes with choice and choice comes with responsibility.
Why do people willingly give up their freedom to a boss, a method or even a despot?
Why do successful entrepreneurs who start a new company take on investors even when they don't need the cash?
Why do so many choose to go into debt when they might be able to avoid it?
Sometimes, we willingly sacrifice our freedom because it creates an other, someone to blame. It gives us hard boundaries and eliminates potential choices. And mostly, it lets us off the hook, because someone else is driving the bus.
Trying to drive from the back of the bus might feel less risky, but it rarely leads to much agency, influence or control as to where the bus actually goes.
Careful what you do with the keys.","July 4, 2017","independence, responsibility, choice"
Whose business are you minding?,"Industries have rules. Rules and benefits.
Hollywood requires agents, casting calls, big budgets and content aimed at a certain part of a certain market. If you follow enough of the rules, the thinking goes, you get a multi-million dollar budget and the red carpet.
Broadway requires a certain length, certain compromises, certain deals. This creates scalpers and hangers on and small audiences filling small theaters. And, if you follow just enough of the rules, you might end up withHamilton. Perhaps one in 10,000 pull this off.
Publishing requires a fealty to the book and to the bookstore, alliances with the right cultural forces and a willingness to create scarcity. If you're persistent and very, very good, you can get picked by theNew Yorkerand you get picked by Little, Brown and you end up withThe Tipping Point. Perhaps one in 100,000 pull this off.
Outsiders who want in, who want to make their mark in movies or investment banking or in politics often decide that minding the business of their industry is the way to reach their goals. After all, it's the insiders that win the awards and get the benefits that go to people who are by and for their industry.
But what if instead of focusing on the industry, you focused on the change you seek to make? On the audience you seek to serve. On doing your customers' business, not the industry's…

Your Bob Dylan story,"I know dozens of people who have a story about meeting, or nearly meeting, or somehow engaging with Bob Dylan.
And just about everyone they know has questions about him, about those encounters, about what it was like.
My guess is that these stories began to spring up long before he was a Nobel Prize winning legend.

Resilience and the high end,"The high end is brittle, unstable and thus, expensive.
The car that wins a race, the wine that costs $300, the stereo that sounds like the real thing… The restaurant that serves perfect fruit, the artisan who uses rare tools and years of training…
If there was a reliable, easy, repeatable way to produce these outputs, we'd all do it and the high end would be normal.
What makes something pure enough, optimized enough and fast enough to defeat the other 99.9% is that it doesn't always work. It is far more sensitive to inputs. It's dangerous…
Maybe you don't need carbon fiber wheels. Maybe you merely need a reliable way to get from here to there at a reasonable price.
The high end is magic, but magic isn't reliable. On purpose. That's what makes it magic.","August 31, 2017","Resilience, High-end, Magic"
Fear of escalation,"In any organization of more than two people, there's the opportunity to escalate a problem.
When the software doesn't work, or the customer is in a jam or something's going sideways, you can hand the problem up the chain. Escalation not only brings more horsepower to the problem, but it spreads the word within the organization. And, even better, it keeps you from losing the customer.
Here's the thing: at some point, organizations start training their people not to escalate. They fear staff will cry wolf, or they get tired of pitching in.
The moment this happens is the moment you begin to give up on your customers.
Either give your front line the power to fix things, on the spot, or encourage them to call for help when it's needed.","August 30, 2017","escalation, customer service, organizational culture"
“I got it!”,"The secret of the fly ball is that you don't shout, ""you'vegot it.""
It's not up to us to assign who will catch it. If you can catch it, you call it.

Marketing about power and with power,"Often overlooked is the decision every marketer makes about how they will treat the issue of power (asymmetrical or not) in their marketing.
Consider insurance. Companies like Allstate don't market themselves as the dominant force in the relationship. They don't say, ""you give us money every month for a very long time, and one day, if we think it's a good idea, we'll give you some money back."" Instead, they say, ""you're in good hands."" Insurance is here to take care of you.
That's pretty different from the power dynamic we see implicit in the marketing of Harley Davidson motorcycles. Buying one makes you James Dean. They give you power over others. Luxury brands promise a similar result in certain social situations.
Horror movies don't promise an equitable experience. You sit there, they scare you.
There's some part of our culture that wants to be told what to do by a powerful autocrat.
Microsoft made a lot of enemies (and friends) when they had monopoly power. The message to users and even to partners was, ""We're in charge and you have no choice… here's what's next."" A large portion of the market responds well to that message. It takes the pressure off decision making and eases responsibility (it can't be your fault if you had no options). Apple is starting to adopt that power mantra with their approach to upgrades and new models.
The new Microsoft, of course, puts the user's power first. Different strategy for a different audience.
Every brand gets to make this choice, pick one of three:
Famous colleges market with straight-up power. We have the power to choose you, to grade you, to give you a magic diploma. And in response, millions of kids send in their applications. In fact, they often avoid the alternative (less famous) schools that instead of power, ask, ""how can we help you?""
Many businesses prefer to buy things when they have no choice. They not only respect the power of the big auditing firms or the race to serve a search engine or a social network, they actually seek it out. It focuses the attention of the bureaucracy and offers the promise of rapid forward motion with little responsibility on the part of the client.
A lot of freelancers, on the other hand, have been beaten down so often that they can't imagine projecting power, instead only offering to serve those that do.
Danny Meyer has built a restaurant empire around the idea that customers ought to be powerful. Instead of bullying his patrons, he trains his people to serve. No velvet rope, just a smile.
Each of us gets to choose what sort of marketing we respond to. Those that use bully tactics to gain power over us only get away with it because it works (on some people, some of the time). And often, when power is put into our hands (sometimes known as freedom… the freedom to create, to speak up, to lead, to challenge), we blink and walk away.
Some people persist in thinking that marketing is about ads or low prices. It's not. It's about human nature and promises and who we see when we look in the mirror.
When you see confusion, look for fear, and look for the dynamics of power.","August 28, 2017","Power dynamics, marketing strategy, consumer behavior"
The toxic antidote to goodwill,"Anyone who has done the math will tell you that word of mouth is the most efficient way to gain trust, spread the word and grow.
And yet…
It only takes a moment to destroy. Only a few sentences, a heartless broken promise, a lack of empathy, and it's gone. Not only that, but the lost connection can easily lead to lawsuits.
Doctor, the surgery seems to have gone wrong!
It's not my fault. I did a perfect job. Tough luck.
Architect, the floor is sagging, the beams were put in the wrong direction!
I don't care. There's a three-year statute of limitations, and even then, it wasn't my job to ensure that the work met the plans.
Airline, my two-year-old can't sit in a row by herself, and the agent on the phone said you'd work it so we could sit together!
It's not my fault. If you don't want to get on the plane, don't get on the plane.
In all three cases, there are significant operational barriers to magically fixing the problem. But that's not where the breakdown happened. It happened because a human being decided to not care. Not care and not express anything that felt like caring.
A human being, perhaps intimidated by lawyers, or tired after a hard day, or the victim of a bureaucracy (all valid reasons) then made the stupid decision to not care.
By not caring, by not expressing any empathy, this individual denied themselves their own humanity. By putting up a brick wall, they isolate themselves. Not only do they destroy any hope for word of mouth, they heap disrespect on someone else. By working so hard to not engage (in the vain hope that this will somehow keep them clean), they end up in the mud, never again to receive the benefit of the doubt.
What kind of day or week or career is that? To live in a lucite bubble, keeping track only of individuals defeated and revenue generated?
It turns out that while people like to have their problems fixed, what they most want is to be seen and to be cared about.
Of course you should use these fraught moments to reinforce connections and build word of mouth. Of course you should realize that in fact people like us get asked to recommend airlines and doctors and architects all the time, but now, we will never ever recommend you to anyone, in fact, we'll go out of our way to keep people from choosing you.
But the real reason you should extend yourself in these moments when it all falls apart is that this is how you will measure yourself over time. What did you do when you had a chance to connect and to care?","August 27, 2017","empathy, goodwill, customer experience"
What you know vs. what you do,"In 1995, my book packaging company published one of its last titles, an anachronism called,Presenting Digital Cash. It was the first book on digital cash ever aimed at a mass audience. And it was ahead of its time, selling (fortunately) very few copies. The examples in the book were current, but it was soon outdated. (The foreword was written by Neal Stephenson—someone who is ahead of his time for a living).
Thirteen long years later, Bitcoin was introduced to the world. I didn't invent it, even though I'd written about digital cash more than a decade before. I'd created an entire book about digital cash, and thought about it deeply for months.
Except I didn't buy 1,000 dollars worth of Bitcoin in 2008. If I had, I'd have more than $40,000,000 today.
It's not that I didn't know.
It's that I didn't act.

Don’t forget the second step,"The first step is learning how to do it. Finding and obtaining the insight and the tools and the techniques you need. Understanding how it works.
But step two is easily overlooked. Step two is turning it into a habit. Committing to the practice. Showing up and doing it again and again until you're good at it, and until it's part of who you are and what you do.
Most education, most hardware stores, most technology purchases, most doctor visits, most textbooks are about the first step. What a shame that we don't invest just a little more to turn the work into a habit.","August 24, 2017","habit, practice, commitment"
Rejection (and the four paths),"If you seek to make change or do something important, your work will be rejected along the way. This is not in dispute.
What will you do after that?
In my experience, paths two and three are the most likely to get you where you're going. It takes grit and resilience to avoid the first path, and the fourth path is reserved for megalomaniacs, bullies and the terminally frustrated.","August 23, 2017","Rejection, Resilience, Change"

Clean sheets at a hotel, for example. The base salary at a job. Your title.

Preparing (for the test of time),"We have a word for the fruitless search for perfect: perfectionism.
And we have a word for what we do when we dumb something down to get approval: the committee.
But what do we call it when we work to make something important?
Something that will last? And be worth the effort?
It's tempting to treat things as disposable, to call it a temporary fix, to do it cheap and fast and apologize as we do.
But maybe this next thing we're going to do–maybe it will last. Maybe it will be like that novel from 60 years ago or the record album from 1962 or even the Flatiron building, 100 years later. Still around.

The problem with direct experience,"""I'll know it when I see it,"" or perhaps, ""I'll see it when I know it…""
We're hardwired to believe and understand the things we can actually experience. That's why no one argues about Newton's laws, but most people panic or shrug when confronted with dark matter, Heisenberg or quarks.
We're often good at accepting what's in front of us, but bad at things that are very far away or very very close. We have trouble with things that are too big and too small, with numbers with lots of zeroes or too many decimal places. And most of all, we fail when trying to predict things that are too far in the future.
Almost nothing in our civilization is merely the result of direct experience. We rely on scouts and technologists and journalists to tell us what it's like over there, to give us a hint about what to expect next, and most of all, to bring the insights and experiences of the larger world to bear on our particular situation.
The peril of roll-your-own science, in which you pick and choose which outcomes of the scientific method to believe is that you're almost certainly going to endanger yourself and others. Anecdotal evidence about placebos, vaccines and the weather outside is fun to talk about, but it's not relevant to what's actually going to pay off in the long run.
78.45% of humans tend to hate statistics because we have no direct experience with the larger picture. It's easier to make things up based on direct experience instead.
The solar eclipse is going to happen whether or not you believe it will, whether or not you have direct experience with previous eclipses.
When we reserve direct experience for the places where it matters—how we feel about the people in our lives, or the music we're listening to or the painting we're seeing, we have the priceless opportunity to become a better version of ourselves.
The rest of the time, standing on a higher ladder and seeing a bit farther is precisely what we ought to seek out.","August 19, 2017","direct experience, perception, science"
Faux intimacy,"True connection is a frightening prospect.
When you are seen by someone else, really seen, it hurts even more if you're ultimately rejected. When we connect, we make promises, buy into a different future, engage with another, someone who might let us down (or we might let them down).
Far easier, of course, to do something more shallow.
A friend on social media is not like a friend in real life.
And so, we sit at dinner, browsing on our phone instead of connecting with the person across from us. Because the phone promises instant gratification, an exciting dopamine hit, and plenty of faux intimacy.
Which is great as far as it goes, but no, it's not the same.","August 18, 2017","Faux intimacy, true connection, social media"
“I have fear”,"There's a common mistranslation that causes us trouble.
We say, ""I am afraid,"" as if the fear is us, forever. We don't say, ""I am a fever"" or ""I am a sore foot."" No, in those cases, we acknowledge that it's a temporary condition, something we have, at least for now, but won't have forever.

On being discovered,"Wouldn't that be great?
Great if you could share all your wisdom on a popular podcast, or be featured on Shark Tank? Great if you had a powerful agent or bureau or publisher? Great if you could get admitted to an internship program that would lead to a well-attended gig on the main stage? Great if the CEO figured out just how committed you are and invited you to her office?
The thing about being discovered is that in addition to being fabulous, it's incredibly rare. Because few people have the time or energy to go hunting for something that might not be there.
The alternative?
To be sought out.
Instead of hoping that people will find you, the alternative is to become the sort of person these people will go looking for.
This is difficult, of course, because it means you have to create work that might not work. That you have to lean out of the boat and invest in making something that's remarkable. That you have to be generous when you feel like being selfish.
Difficult because there's no red carpet, no due dates and no manual.
But that's okay, because your work is worth it.

Sloppy science,"We can measure it.
For decades, every single year, scientists have visited the Galapagos and measured the beaks of a particular species offinch.
And year after year, with each generation, the beaks change, exactly as we'd expect from the weather patterns of the year before. Evolutionary biology works, and rigorous data collection backs it up.
For hundreds of years, though, science has gotten it wrong about gender, race and ethnicity. Eugenics and its brethren sound simple, but often lead to tragic outcomes.
The sloppy scientist says, ""on average, across populations, left to its own devices, this group is [not as skilled] [neurotic] [hard to work with] [not as smart] [not as strong] [slower]"" etc. They make assumptions without sufficient data, and the rigor is missing.
The first problem is that human beings aren't averages, they're individuals. And the bigger problem is thatwe're never left to our own devices.We are creatures of culture.
The math that we can do on populations of hedgehogs or pigeons doesn't apply to people, because people build and change and experience culture differently than any other species.
Your DNA is virtually identical to that of the hordes that accompaniedGhengis Khan, as well as most Cro-Magnon cavemen–pass one on the street and you wouldn't be able to tell that he's different from you. The reason you don't act the way they did is completely the result of culture, not genes.
It's culture that pushes us to level up, to dig deeper, to do things that we might not otherwise do. It's culture that finds and encourages and pushes people to become better versions of themselves than anyone else expected to find.
So it was sloppy/lazy/fearful science that said that women couldn't handle being doctors. And it was sloppy science that worked to limit the number of Asian or Jewish students at various institutions. And it's sloppy science that's been used against black people for hundreds of years.
And sloppy science said that a 4 minute mile was impossible and that a woman could never finish a marathon.
Sloppy because it doesn't include all the relevant factors. There's nothing wrong with the scientific method, but everything is wrong with using it poorly (and often intentionally).
What we need are caring human beings who will choose to change the culture for the better.
Notallof it, of course. Merely the culture they can touch. The people they can engage with. The human beings they can look in the eye, offer to help, offer encouragement and offer a hand up.
Once we reset the standard, it becomes the new normal, and suddenly, the sloppy science seems like phrenology. Because culture is up to us.
Sloppy science isn't science at all. It's the lazy or wrongheaded use of the scientific method part of the time, mixing in fear for good measure. Ignoring culture ignores the part that truly matters.
It's tempting to judge people by their DNA. It makes a lot more sense, though, to see people based on what they can contribute instead.","August 15, 2017","Sloppy science, culture, individualism"
“But we needed the eggs”,"Addiction to substances has been around ever since someone fermented grapes a million years ago. The opioid epidemic is the latest addiction tragedy, brought on by greed and disinformation.
It took longer for behavioral addictions to arrive, but they're just as real.
The ASAM defines it:Addiction is characterized by inability to consistently abstain, impairment in behavioral control, craving, diminished recognition of significant problems with one’s behaviors and interpersonal relationships, and a dysfunctional emotional response.
The thing is that we treat behavioral addictions differently because sometimes they're seen as a useful, profitable contribution.
We've gotten better, much better, at creating interactions and substances that are addictive. They get built and marketed because they're profitable, but the creators of these systems don't want to take responsibility for the impact they have on people. Behavior addiction is real, it's chronic and you might be suffering from it.
Get addicted to the rush at work, or to the endless flow of the online world, and your life changes. Attention spans go down, patience decreases, essential tasks are left undone, and most of all, our humanity starts to fade away.
Just because it appears productive, just because you bought it in a store or got promoted for it at work doesn't mean it's not addictive and worth managing. Even if you need theeggs.","August 14, 2017","Addiction, Behavioral, Impact"

Appearing to care,"We know that your customers will put up with imperfect, but one thing that they'd like in return is for you to care.
Marketers keep making big promises, and organizations struggle to keep those promises. Sooner or later, it leads to a situation where the broken promise arrives on the customer's lap.
In that moment, what the customer wants most is someone to care.
Almost as good: an organization that consistentlyactslike it cares.
It's a mistake to believe that you actually have to care the way the customer cares, and that anything less means you shouldn't even try. In fact, professionals do emotional labor all the time. They present the best version of their professional self they are capable of.
When Bette Midler shows up on stage in Hello Dolly, the audience would like to believe that she's as engaged and excited as she was on opening night. And she might be. Or not. What matters is that we can't tell.

Bought,"How much does it cost you in tolls to drive across town? In most cities, the answer is nothing.
How much does it cost you to take a bus or subway across town? In most cities, if it's available at all, quite a bit.
How did that come to be?
Mass transit is safer, cleaner and more efficient. It gives more people more access to work and amenities. A city with great mass transit works better for more people. Even those that don't use it. It's at least a useful public good as the streets are.
It's technically easy to put tolls all over a city, wastes no time, and it's economically efficient to make it incrementally free to hop on a bus and expensive to drive a car.
So why haven't we? Why, in fact, are we going the other direction?
Because left to our own devices, we go for the short-term cost savings at the expense of the long-term investment.
Because we like the status quo.
Because there's familiar profit in the car-industrial complex. The extraction industries, the manufacturers, the dealers, etc. It's an ongoing, widespread income stream. This generates cash to pay lobbyists and others to create a cultural dynamic in favor of the status quo.

The taxi or the cruise ship?,"The successful cab owner knows this:
Every ride is custom
People choose a cab precisely because they can ride alone, on their own terms
Empty trips are part of the job, and it's okay, because the next ride will pay for it.
On the other hand, the person who chooses to run a cruise line knows:
Every cruise is designed by me, and people sign up precisely because I chose well
People choose a cruise ship to be with other people, to benefit from economies of scale and to be part of something
Empty trips (or worse, half-empty trips) can put the line out of business
It's pretty easy to get into the cab business. Do a few rides for friends, then list online, or join Lyft, then go full-time.
On the other hand, it's much more difficult to get into the cruise business. There's a critical mass, and the minimum number is a lot more than one customer.
Each business can be a good one if you do it at the appropriate scale.
The warning, and the purpose of the metaphor, is to realize that it's not a matter of gradually going from one to the other. Remember that running a taxi is a fine sort of business, but don't expect to turn it into a cruise ship. And vice versa.","August 5, 2017","Taxi business, Cruise line, Business model"
The money maximization distraction,"The Rolling Stones have grossed more than a billion dollars in ticket sales and endorsements. Does that mean that they're better than Beethoven, John Adams and Zoe Keating, put together? Were the Bay City Rollers better than Patti Smith?
There are CEOs who make more in a year than 1,000 of their workers. Does that mean that they're 1,000 times more important or productive or worthwhile?
Money is a simple metric, and one that captures a certain sort of information about value and scarcity. But it's wildly inaccurate when it comes to measuring many of the things that actually matter to us. It can mask the emotions and moments and contributions that we work so hard on, the people that we seek to become, the contributions that we seek to make.
Profitable is not the same as important
Popular is the not the same as worthwhile
Expensive is not the same as well-done
And yet, because it's easy to rank and compare and change, we can get seduced into believing that money is the metric that matters the most, that matters all the time. If we only use money to make our decisions about worth, we're going to get it wrong almost every time.
Until we get significantly better at matching money to contribution, we need to embrace the difficult to measure. I'll trade you a great fourth grade teacher for a foreign exchange desk currency trader any day.","August 4, 2017","value, money, contribution"
The Peter Possibility,"Dr. Laurence Peter understood the promise and peril of bureaucracy better than most. Fifty years ago, he wrote, ""managers rise to the level of their incompetence."" The Peter Principle states that if you do a good job, you get promoted, until you reach a job where you're incompetent, and there you stay… meaning that sooner or later, the entire organization is filled with incompetent people stuck in their slot.
Bureaucracy promises us a safe spot, and it also offers the upside that if you do a good job, you'll get chosen, picked, promoted and will move up. So, keep your head down, do what you're told and you win.
We don't live in that world any more.
And the upside is definitely more positive and a lot more scary:
You (and you alone) get to decide if you want to move ""up"". If you want to be promoted, have more influence, more leverage and more responsibility.
Fearful that we'll expose our incompetence, we hide. Remembering the lessons of childhood, we wait to get picked.

The management of whales,"In online gaming, a whale is someone who plays far more than the typical player. It's not unusual for 2% of the player base to account for 95% of all the usage.
The same thing is true at the local gym. All the money is made on the customers who pay and never come–the folks who are at the gym or the pool for 5 hours a day use far more resources than you could possibly charge for if everyone acted this way.
The management of whales, then, is a delicate balancing act—the people who love you the most are also costing you the most. If you have too many or they take too much from the buffet, your economics are shot.
In a traditional business, one where people pay based on usage, a whale is the difference between profit and loss. That person who eats at your restaurant once a week, or goes to see Hamilton six or twelve times… This is one of the best uses of customer data. You have the chance to find people who truly are your best customers, and to treat them accordingly. A business that gets this right will outperform one that doesn't by as much as 5:1.
But there are also whales when it comes to word of mouth. Most people tell no one. A few people tell a friend or two. But some people tell everyone. And they do it with authority. With leverage. And with persistence.
A whale like this is priceless. You can't bribe someone into becoming a whale, but you can dissuade them and disappoint them merely by not caring enough to notice.
Best of all, you have a chance to become whale-worthy. To design products and services that are precisely the sort of thing that heavy users will happily use, and that powerful sneezers will happily talk about.
Actually, it's not really about the management of whales at all—it's more like seeing them, leading them and respecting them.","August 1, 2017","whales, customer management, word of mouth"

Facing the inner critic,"Part of his power comes from the shadows.
We hear his voice, we know it by heart. He announces his presence with a rumble and he runs away with a wisp of smoke.
But again and again, we resist looking him in the eye, fearful of how powerful he is. We're afraid that like the gorgon, he will turn us to stone. (I'm using the male pronoun, but the critic is a she just as often).
He's living right next to our soft spot, the (very) sore place where we store our shame, our insufficiency, our fraudulent nature. And he knows all about it, and pokes us there again and again.
As Steve Chapman points out in his generousTEDx talk,it doesn't have to be this way. We can use the critic as a compass, as a way to know if we're headed in the right direction.
Pema Chödrön tells the story of inviting the critic to sit for tea. To welcome him instead of running.
It's not comfortable, but is there any other way? The sore spot is unprotectable. The critic only disappears when we cease to matter. They go together.
We can dance with him, talk with him, welcome him along for a long, boring car ride. Suddenly, he's not so dangerous. Sort of banal, actually.

Well, if that’s what you need, build it on purpose.
The biggest difference between great work and pretty-good work are the meetings that accompanied it.
The crisp meeting is one of a series. It’s driven by purpose and intent. It’s guided by questions:
Who should be in the room?
What’s the advance preparation we ought to engage in? (at least an hour for every meeting that’s worth holding).

What’s the deadline?
What does the reporting cycle look like–dates and content and responsibilities?
Who is the decision maker on each element of the work?
What’s the model–what does a successful solution look like?
Who can say no, who can change the spec, who can adjust the budget?
When things go wrong, what’s our approach to fixing them?
What constitutes an emergency, and what is the cost (in time, effort and quality) of stopping work on the project to deal with the emergency instead?
Is everyone in the room enrolled in the same project, or is part of the project to persuade the nay-sayers?

The under (and the over) achiever,"It doesn't matter what the speed limit is. He's going to drive five miles slower.

When leading a team, it's tempting to slow things down for the people near the back of the pack. It doesn't matter, though. They'll just slow down more. They like it back there.

Unbridled,"There's a school of thought that argues that markets are the solution to everything. That money is the best indication of value created. That generating maximum value for shareholders is the only job. That the invisible hand of the market is the best scorekeeper and allocator. ""How much money can you make?"" is the dominant question.
And frequently, this money-first mindset is being matched with one that says that any interference in the market is unnecessary and inefficient. That we shouldn't have the FDA, that businesses should be free to discriminate on any axis , that a worker's rights disappear at the door of the factory or the customer's at the lunch counter–if you don't like it, find a new job, a new business to patronize, the market will adjust.
Taken together, this financial ratchet creates a harsh daily reality. The race to the bottom kicks in, and even those that would ordinarily want to do more, contribute more and care more find themselves unable to compete, because the ratchet continues to turn.
The problem with a race to the bottom is that you might win. Worse, you could come in second.
There are no capitalist utopias. No country and no market where unfettered capitalism creates the best possible outcome. Not one. They suffer from smog, from a declining state of education and health, and most of all, from too little humanity. Every time that the powerful tool of capitalism makes things better it succeeds because it works within boundaries.
It's worth noting that no unbridled horse has ever won an important race.
The best way for capitalism to do its job is for its proponents to insist on clear rules, fairly enforced. To insist that organizations not only enjoy the benefits of what they create, but bear the costs as well. To fight against cronyism and special interests, and on behalf of workers, of communities and education. That's a ratchet that moves in the right direction.

Can you live in a shepherd’s hut?,"The best way to plan a house on a vacant piece of land is to move into a tinyshepherd's huton a corner of the property. It's not fancy, and it's not comfortable, but you can probably stay there for a week or two.
And during that week, you'll understand more about the land than you ever could in an hour of walking around. You'll see how the rain falls and the sun shines and the puddles form.
As you've probably guessed, you can do that with the job you're thinking about taking or the project you're thinking about launching. Show up in the market and make some sales. Take a role as an intern and answer the customer service hotline for a day. Get as close as you can to the real thing, live it, taste it, and then decide how to build your career or your organization.

Selling confusion,"Over the last few decades, there's been a consistent campaign to sow confusion around evolution, vaccines and climate change.
In all three areas, we all have access to far more data, far more certainty and endless amounts of proof that the original theories have held up. The data is more accurate than it's ever been. Evolution is the best way to explain and predict the origin and change of species. Vaccines are not the cause of autism and save millions of kids' (and parents') lives. And the world is, in fact, getting dangerously warmer.
And yet…
Poll after poll in many parts of the world show that people are equivocating or outright denying all three. Unlike the increasingly asymptotic consistency in scientific explanations, the deniers have an endless list of reasons for their confusion, many of which contradict each other. Confusion doesn't need to be right to be confusing.
Worth noting that this response doesn't happen around things that are far more complicated or scientifically controversial (like gravity and dark matter). It's the combination of visceral impact and tribal cohesion that drives the desire to deny.
Cigarette companies were among the original denialists (they claimed that cigarettes were unrelated to lung cancer, but that didn't work out very well for them), and much of their confusion playbook is being used on these new topics..
To what end? Confusion might help some industries or causes in the short run, but where does it lead? Working to turn facts into political issues doesn't make them any less true.
If this growing cohort 'wins', what do they get? In apost-scienceworld, where physics and testable facts are always open to the layman's opinion in the moment, how are things better? How does one develop a new antibiotic without an understanding of speciation and disease resistance?
I know what the science p.o.v. gets us if it prevails, if evolution is taught in schools, if vaccines become ever safer and widespread, if governments and corporations begin to ameliorate and prepare for worldwide weather change.
What's a mystery is what the anti-science confusors get if they prevail. What happens when wedon'traise the next generation of scientists, when vaccines become politically and economically untenable, when we close our eyes and simplyrebuild houseson the floodplain again? Gravity doesn't care if you believe in it, neither does lung cancer.

Beware of false averages,"Some people like really spicy food. Some people like bland food. Building a restaurant around sorta spicy food doesn't make either group happy.
It's tempting to look at pop music, network TV and the latest hot fashion and come to the conclusion that the recipe for success is to focus group everyone, average it up and make something that pleases the big hump in the middle, while not offending most of the outliers.
But few things are up for a majority-rule vote. Instead, the tail keeps getting longer, and choice begets more choice. As a result, people don't need to abandon their hump to head to the non-existent middle.
Yes, there are true averages (like how high to mount a doorknob). But more often than not, trying to please everyone a little is a great way to please most people not at all.

Fitting in all the way,"It seems like a fine way to earn trust. Merely fit in. In every way. Don't do anything to draw attention to yourself, to be left out, to challenge the status quo. Go along with the crowd to get ahead.
That doesn't build trust. It simply makes you easy to overlook.
We build trust when we make promises and then keep them.

Appropriate collusion (organizing the weaker side),"Businesses with power are prohibited from colluding with one another to set prices or other policies. For good reason. Public officials and economists realize that it’s quite tempting for anoligopolyto work to artificially create scarcity or cooperate–it creates significant short term profits and hurts those without the power to do something about it.
(but that doesn’t mean thatorganizationsdon’t continually try anyway).
Organizations with power now use data mining and softwarelicensesto gain ever more one-sided relationships with those they used to serve. They trade data about yourcreditand your surfing habits, among a thousand other things.
But what about the opposite? What about the power shift that could result from the disconnected masses working together to push organizations to make change or to limit their upsides? By banding together and coordinating information, they can prevent asymmetrical information and leverage from causing as much harm. What would happen if 10,000Wells Fargocustomers had found each other years ago?
Years ago, twenty of AOL’s largest content providers got together (I think it was in a hot tub) at an event AOL was running. We exchanged information about our contracts, our advances and our royalty rates. As a result of the shared information, everyone who participated got a better deal the next time around. Coordination led to a shift in market power.
Kickstarter gives a small hint of this. A creator says to disconnected people–if enough of you get together and indicate an interest, we’ll do this thing. This is also in the spirit of Fred Wilson'sUnion 2.0. Organization creates market power.
But the internet can let us take this much further. It can create enforceable group dynamics and help people find one another. And once found, they can insist on policies and offerings that the powerful organization would never have proposed. And it turns out that this more equal engagement can help both sides in the long run.
This is particularly effective in high-value business to business settings, where a company might sell a very expensive service to 20 or 30 companies. Knowledge about the best deal and coordination of desired features can make a huge difference for all concerned. That's why computer user groups were so important back in the day.
What would happen if the 1,000 top high school football prospects all agreed not to play a few games unless colleges paid them for engaging in the health-endangering sport that makes these non-profits so much money they can afford to pay their coachesmillionsof dollars?
What would happen if the fifty cities in the running for Amazon’s second HQ established a binding agreement on what they wouldn’t do with taxpayer money? By creating a mutually shared line in the sand, they’ve ensured that the flow of capital won’tbankruptany of them. The auction will still happen, but not in a destructive way.
They could make a similar deal about future sportsstadiumsor Olympic bids, a sucker bet in which the winner almost always loses.
Creating “I will if you will” contingent agreements is significantly easier once we use the blockchain and the real-time coordinating power of the net. A conceptual example (hard to do with four weeks notice, though): The fifty cities agree that if all fifty cities agree, any tax break from a city or state to Amazon must be matched by that city or state with a 5x amount invested in their public schools. If the mutual agreement doesn’t reach the critical number, no deal happens. If it does, then every mayor and every governor has a great reason to use other less costly incentives to win the ‘auction’ without violating the mutual agreement (or invest in schools, which is okay too).
The alternative is that we’ll continue to see large, powerful corporations and institutions peel away individual players (people or cities), one by one, without the famed free market there to ensure equity. You probably have more in common with your neighbors than you think. If only you could coordinate the discussion…","September 15, 2017","collusion, market power, coordination"
"Impossible, unlikely or difficult?","Difficult tasks have a road map. With effort, we can get from here to there. It might surprise you to realize thatdifficultis easy once you have the resources and commitment. Paving a road is difficult, so is customer service and fixing software bugs.
Butimpossibleandunlikelyare where we get hung up.
On Tuesday, Apple launched a thousand dollar phone. The engineers and designers had unlimited time (ten years since the first one), unlimited resources, unlimited market power. It's possible that there hasn't been that much unlimited in one place in our entire lives. And, yet, all they could build was an animatedemojimachine. A slightly better phone. A series of difficult tasks, mostly achieved.
It's not that another breakthrough is impossible. It's not that we've explored all the edges of human connectivity, of alternative currencies, of education, of personal transformation or generosity. It's not that we've already performed all the leaps in safety, in technology, in identity. Or even productivity. Of course not. It's not impossible to leap again with the magic computer we all have in our pocket.
What tripped up Apple, as it trips up many successful organizations or careers, is that the next leap isn't impossible… it's merely unlikely. It was unlikely that the original iPhone would have actually been transformative, but Steve took a huge leap and got lucky on the other side. It could easily have gone sideways. He tried for something that was unlikely to work, but it did.
That same sort of leap, the one into the unlikely, is available to all of us, at different scales. It's unlikely that our next brave novel, our next breakthrough speech, our next scary but generous project will succeed. Unlikely but worth it.
Unlikely never feels quite the same as difficult, and sometimes it appears impossible. It's neither. It's something risky, and something without a map or a guarantee. We hesitate to do it precisely because it might not work, precisely because it's more than difficult.
Working on an unlikely project takes guts and hubris. It requires us to have the insight to distinguish it from the impossible, and the desire to not merely do the difficult.

Building on maximized systems,"If you eat beef, you're probably using a maximized system. It's a commodity, and every part of the chain is under huge pressure to increase yield and cut corners. The animals are pushed to the brink, and so are the humans that work on them.
And if you keep your money in the bank, it's likely that the same thing is happening. Every investment is chosen for maximum short term benefit, because that's the only way for the bank to beat the other banks.
A race to the bottom.
The challenge gets worse when a maximized system is pushed just a little further. ""Maximized"" means that more demands and more inputs lead to degradation, lower output and eventual system failure.

Optimized or maximized?,"I once drove home from college at 100 miles an hour. It saved two hours. My old car barely made it, and I was hardly able to speak once I peeled myself out of the car.
That was maximum speed, but it wasn't optimum.
Systems have an optimum level of performance. It's the output that permits the elements (including the humans) to do their best work, to persist at it, to avoid disasters, bad decisions and burnout.
One definition of maximization is: A short-term output level of high stress, where parts degrade but short-term performance is high.
Capitalism sometimes seeks competitive maximization instead. Who cares if you burn out, I'll just replace the part…
That's not a good way to treat people we care about, or systems that we rely on.
As a valuable contributor seeking to build a career, you benefit when you develop a unique asset, because that asset gives you the leverage to choose a niche in a system that respects optimization instead.

Toward cooperation,"It's tempting to be oppositional. To see the different as the other. To dominate, to win, to move up as others move down (because in the zero sum game that we've built around us, that's the only way).
But a networked world, one based on connection—one held together by the sheerest gossamer—can't tolerate the tension and pain that bullying and dominance require.

The power of community learning,"It's easy to imagine that some things have to be the way they've always been. That music has to be delivered on a round platter. That an overnight stay needs to be in a hotel. And that learning is solely the result of top-down lectures plus tests for compliance.
The internet is a transformational technology, not merely a faster way to send an email. People all over the world are learning more deeply, transforming their expectations and changing their role and their contribution. It's time for your voice to be heard.
One of the surprising benefits of combining video with peer-to-peer learning is that you get to talk aboutyourwork, explore your specifics and work with others in discovering what can work for you, not just learn in the abstract. This is something we can deliver in a format that's almost impossible in a book or lecture alone.
The impact that the Marketing Seminar has had on the thousands of people who have enrolled is just stunning. It's a transformative three month experience that helps people see things differently and gives them the support and momentum to go make their ruckus.
Here's a note, unedited, from a recent graduate ofThe Marketing Seminar.
100 days is a long time.
Many have shared their challenges and victories and tagged fellow and sister students who illuminated our path.
Many more are still on the journey. They’re overcoming setbacks, distractions and competing priorities.
It’s now Day 107. In the past week, I’ve shifted gears from intense learning to intense doing. I’ve shipped more in the past week than I’d shipped in the previous several months. They weren’t all products going out the door. Some were decisions and turning points that clarified where Web Story Builder is headed and why. It’s saying “no” at a key moment when four months ago I would have said “yes,” believing that I could be everything to everyone.
It’s tempting to start tagging people that made an impact on me. I’m not doing that because it’s easy to tag those who have commented or posted the most. That would leave out an important group: Those who don’t talk as much. Those who read and liked. Or just read. All of them, every single one of you, made an impact on me.
The Discourse stats say that I have visited 98 days with a cumulative viewing time of four days, posted 58 topics and 392 replies (and counting), and clicked the “like” button almost 800 times. And there are currently 210 topics that I haven’t read and oodles more that need replies. A single comment can change my world. Or yours.
So it turns out that 100 days is just enough to create new habits and cement new ways of thinking. The world is different now. We are different.
… Godspeed!

Ignore the mob that would like you to feel badly for not fitting in. Categories are rarely permanent, and most important work is done by people who don't easily fit in.
Realize that no one is more aware of your minor flaws than you are. No one else is noticing the little nick in your tooth or the fact that your shoelaces don't match.

Airbrushing,"When they began airbrushing the models in fashion magazines fifty years ago, no one complained much. Everyone knew, we thought, that it was some sort of make believe.
But then they started airbrushing our food.

And family photos.
And brands.
And jobs.

Which may very well cause you to amplify the differences, to magnify the distance between you and the airbrushed person with the online life. It's gotten to the point where people even airbrush their difficulties, making them ever more dramatic in their drama.

Everybody is a marketer,"But most of us don't like to admit it.
That's because selfish marketers are pretty scummy. They steal our attention, they lie to us, they use shame and guilt and the short-term zinger to get us to buy something we don't want and don't need.
That's not you, of course. You're trying to bring your idea to the world, grow your freelance practice or do a great job for the company you work for. You're trying to make change happen, to influence the culture and help people find something that they'll be glad they discovered.
What's the best way to do that?
What's the best way to persuade your boss, your co-workers or your investors to move forward? What's the most powerful story to tell to the outside world, to get a business to stock your product or a person to fall in love with your art?
Answering these questions is the reason we builtThe Marketing Seminar.
More than 3,000 people have enrolled in the first two sessions, and we're running it just one more time this year.
It's a unique way of learning, a hybrid of more than 50 video lectures from me combined with an ongoing discussion board. Over the course of the 100 day seminar, we ask each other more than 200 different questions, questions that will shape your thinking and give you an opening to find a better way to make a difference.
It's tempting to hide your voice, to keep your work quiet, to shy away from speaking up about the contribution you want to make. We've been so bruised by marketing, by all the noise and hassle that comes with it, that sometimes it's easier to just sit back. But modern marketing is different. Modern marketing is based on humility, empathy and effectiveness. We can show you how to do this, to find your voice, to discover the niche where you can thrive.
I'm delighted to announce thatthe new seminar begins September 12(see all thedetailshere). There are new videos every other day until mid-December, and you can watch them and respond at your own pace.
You've already decided to be a marketer, because you've already decided that you want your ideas to be heard. Now, the only question is:will you decide to be really good at it?

Compulsory Education is an oxymoron (back-to-school rant),"Effective education is rarely done TO people. It's donewiththem.
I had my first professional teaching gig forty years ago this summer. Since then, I've taught at institutions like NYU and Tufts, at community colleges, from the stage, one on one and most of all, on the vanguard of digital media.
As our hemisphere goes back to school this week, I hope you'll spend a few minutes thinking about who school is for, what it's for, how it works and how it doesn't. We're wasting a huge amount of time and money, bankrupting our children, hindering progress and stultifying growth, all at the same time. Even worse, we're not even seeing all the things we're not learning, not engaging with, not creating, because we're so busy learning like it's 1904.

I've written a popular Medium post,""Will This be on the Test?,""in which I outline how thealtMBAand The Marketing Seminar are pioneering changes in adult education. Digital learning isn't merely a version of in-person learning, (online).
It's an entirely different experience, one that can transform people faster and with more impact. The exchanges, the experience and the outputs are all dramatically different.

Irresistible is rarely easy or rational,"There's often a line out the door.
It's not surprising. The ice cream is really good, the portions are enormous, and a waffle cone costs less than three Canadian dollars. And it's served with a smile, almost a grin.
It's irresistible.
Of course, once you finish the cone, you'll stroll around, hang out by the water and maybe start to make plans about where to spend a week on next year's vacation.
TheOpinicon, a lovely little resort near Ottawa, could charge a lot more for an ice cream cone. A team of MBAs doing a market analysis and a P&L would probably pin the value at about $8. That's where the ROI would be at its peak.
But they're not in the business of selling ice cream cones. The ice cream cones are a symbol, a beacon, a chance to engage.
If you run everything through a spreadsheet, you might end up with a rational plan, but the rational plan isn't what creates energy or magic or memories.
Stew Leonard's was a small supermarket with a big footprint. They were profiled by Tom Peters and had the highest sales per square foot of any store of its kind. As they grew to a few more stores, a new generation took over, one that seems more intent on ROI and less focused on magic. As a result, profits went up. For a while. But now, year after year, it's a bit less crowded, a bit less energetic, a bit less interesting. So when new store options open nearby, they lose a few more customers, then a few more, and finally, people begin to wonder, ""why do I even bother coming here?""

To play a round, someone says a letter. The next person in the order has to add a letter to the first, beginning a word. For example, the first person might begin by saying, “y” and then, the next person could say, “o”. The third could say “u” because three letters don’t count as a word.
Beginning with the fourth letter, the goal is to not complete the word. So, if the letters are y-o-u from the first three players, the fourth player shouldn’t say “r” because that would make a word. But it’s fine to say “t”.
If, on your turn, you are stuck and there’s no choice but to say a letter that completes a word (in this case, “h”), you lose the round. Every time you lose a round, you get stuck with another letter in the word ‘ghost’, hence the name of the game. If you lose five rounds, you’re out of the game. The last person left, wins.
If you lose a round, it’s your turn to start the next round by picking a new letter.
Okay, three simple complications:
And the big complication, the one that changes everything and makes this a game for the ages:
Once you get the hang of it, the group can play reverso. This means that when it’s your turn, you’re allowed to add a letterbeforethe string, if you choose, instead of after. So now, words can be built in either direction, and game becomes magical.
‘y-o-u’ can now become ‘a-y-o-u’ and then ‘b-a-y-o-u’.
‘r-d-s-c-r’ for example, isn’t worth challenging, because ‘hardscrabble’ is a word.
If you want to play reverso g-h-o-s-t as a finite game, with thrown elbows and strategy, it makes a terrific two-player game.
If you want to play it as an infinite game, setting up friends and family to do ever better, a game that never ends and has wordcraft and humor to it, you can do that as well. PS Olivia has a new version that usescards.
[A suggestion from Jim F.: “I would offer an amendment to the game of Ghost as we play it in my family. When a player receives their fifth letter, they are no longer part of the spelling, but they remain in the game by becoming a “ghost”. Any active player who speaks to a Ghost receives an additional letter each time they speak to a Ghost. Ghosts are motivated to get active players to speak to them, and thus are not eliminated but adopt a new role.”]
Have fun.

Degrees of freedom,"All you have to do is look around to realize just how many choices we still have. What to eat, who to speak to, what to do for a living, what to learn, what to say, who to contribute to, how we interact, what we stand for…
The safe and comfortable path is to pretend that we're blocked at every turn.
But most of the turns, we don't even see. We've trained ourselves to ignore them.

Stuntvertising,"The math has changed.
It used to be, you paid money to run an ad. A little piece of media, bought and paid for. The audience came with the slot.
Today, of course, the ad is free to run. Post your post, upload your video. Free.
What to measure, then?
Well, one thing to measure is attention. How many likes or shares or views did it get?
But if you're going to optimize for attention, not trust or results or contribution, then you're on a very dangerous road.
It's pretty easy to get attention by running down the street naked (until everyone else does it). But that's not going to accomplish your goals.
When Oreo gets attention for a tweet or Halotop for a horrible ad, they're pulling a stunt, not contributing to their mission.

"Decision making, after the fact","Critics are eager to pick apart complex decisions made by others.
Prime Ministers, CEOs, even football coaches are apparently serially incompetent. If they had only listened to folks who knew precisely what they should have done, they would have been far better off.
Of course, these critics have a great deal of trouble making less-complex decisions in their own lives. They carry the wrong credit cards, buy the wrong stocks, invest in the wrong piece of real estate.
Some of them even have trouble deciding what to eat for dinner.
Complex decision making is a skill—it can be learned, and some people are significantly better at it than others. It involves instinct, without a doubt, but also the ability to gather information that seems irrelevant, to ignore information that seems urgent, to patiently consider not just the short term but the long term implications.
The loudest critics have poor track records in every one of these areas.
Mostly, making good decisions involves beginning with a commitment to make a decision. That's the hard part. Choosing the best possible path is only possible after you've established that you've got the guts and the commitment to make a decision.","October 21, 2017","Decision making, critics, complexity"

A publishing master class,"Announcing a two-day workshop in my office for 8 people.
I define publishing as the work of investing in intellectual property and monetizing it by bringing it to people who want to pay for it. The world of publishing is changing fast, and I'd like to help a few publishers make a difference.
Publishing can include music, books, conferences and other experiences and content. The ideas may change, but the work of publishing at scale has much in common across all fields.
[Update: We've had more than 1,000 applications, so I'm going to close the form, thanks.]
Here's a quick FAQ:
Who's it for?Thoughtful leaders who are committed to publishing in a new way, making a difference and contributing to our culture by bringing out work that matters (and supporting those who make it). We're particularly looking for a mix of people with experiences and dreams that fall outside the mainstream in terms of background, posture or credentials. I think publishing is a profession, and I'd like to help others that do as well.
How much does it cost?I'm not charging a fee. Running a workshop is a powerful exercise, and I'll probably learn as much as you will. You'll need to pay your way here and find a place to stay, so I figure you'll have some skin in the game. Not everything is about making a profit. Maybe we'll even change a few lives.
Can you do it remotely, or turn it into something bigger?Not right now, sorry.
What do you know about publishing?Well, I've been publishing books, software, music, courses and even action figures for more than thirty years. Here are somehighlights. This seminar follows on from the SAMBA, the FeMBA, the Agenda session and other intensives I've hosted over the years.
If you're interested, please apply right away. The deadline is really soon, and we never admit the last four people who apply to anything we do.","October 19, 2017","publishing workshop, intellectual property, immersive learning"
Processing negative reviews,"Assumption: Some people love what you do. They love your product, your service, the way you do your work (if that's not true, this post isn't for you. You have a more significant problem to work on first).
So, how to understand it when someonehateswhat you do? When they post a one-star review, or cross the street to avoid your shop, or generally are unhappy with the very same thing that other people love?
It's not for them.
They want something you don't offer. Or they want to buy it from someone who isn't you. Or they don't understand what it's for or how or why you do it.
Some of these things you can address by telling a story more clearly, some you can't.
Either way, right now, they're telling you one thing: It's not for them.

I got a note yesterday from a recent grad of thealtMBA. He said, ""I have to say that the value I have gained from this group far exceeds anything I could give back, and please know that it is rippling out and will affect many more than just the people that went through the program. Thank you…""
We put together this short video about the impact that this 30-day workshop is having on the thousands of people who have gone through it. I'll be talking a little bit about how and why we made it viaFacebook Livetoday at 10 am NY time.

What makes your sirens go off…,"Somewhere, someone is doing something that got your attention, inciting you into action. Somewhere, someone is:
Which of these is your kind of urgent, a chance to take umbrage or perhaps, a call to action?
Which one turns our heads, gets our attention and breaks our rhythm?
We notice what we care about and work hard to ignore the rest. You can change what you care about by changing what you notice.","October 17, 2017","Attention, Urgency, Awareness"
Price vs. cost,"Price is a simple number. How much money do I need to hand you to get this thing?
Cost is more relevant, more real and more complicated.
Cost is what I had to give up to get this. Cost is how much to feed it, take care of it, maintain it and troubleshoot it. Cost is my lack of focus and my cost of storage. Cost is the externalities, the effluent, the side effects.
Just about every time, cost matters more than price, and shopping for price is a trap.","October 16, 2017","Price, Cost, Value"
Look around,"Proximity matters a great deal.
Detroit car executives in the 1970s and 1980s consistently failed to respond to the threat from Japanese imports. They weren't merely arrogant—they were blinded by proximity. Everyone in their neighborhood, everyone on their commute, everyone in their parking lot was driving an American car. How could there be a problem?
We define the universe around us as normal. It's one of the only ways to stay sane—we assume that the noise in our head is in the head of other people, that what we yearn for or buy is what others do as well. And we look to the world around us for confirmation.
This truth can take us to two insights:","October 15, 2017","proximity, American cars, market blindness"
On speaking up,"The status quo is not kind. It works overtime to stay the status quo, and that means that new ideas, urgent pleas and cries for justice are rarely easily voiced.
We're pleased that Annie Kenney stood up for a woman's right to vote all those years ago, even if she got arrested for doing so. And we're proud of Elijah Harper, who brought a debate to a standstill when he stood up for the rights of indigenous people. We're glad that Lois Gibbs stood up to fight for the families near Love Canal, and that Rachel Carson was able to save countless lives by blowing the whistle on how we were poisoning ourselves.
The historical examples are pretty much beyond dispute. When we think about the past, our heroes are those that were willing to persist even when their critics tried to silence them.
Where it becomes challenging is when someone around us chooses to speak up. Today. Now.
It might be someone in HR who risks his job to report the boss to the board. Or it might be an unlikely activist, standing up for a cause that wasn't on our radar. It might be someone in accounting who has found a better way to do things, or an unknown with no power or authority who stands up and says, ""follow me.""
We can't judge those that challenge the status quo merely on their rule breaking. Because the rules only exist to maintain the status quo.
Instead, we have to work ever harder on seeing, listening and supporting the quiet voices who have something important to say. Perhaps, if we listen a bit harder, we'll be able to do the right thing that much sooner.","October 14, 2017","Speaking up, status quo, activism"
Seeking sonder,"Sonderis defined as that moment when you realize that everyone around you has an internal life as rich and as conflicted as yours.
That everyone has a noise in their head.
That everyone thinks that they are right, and that they have suffered affronts and disrespect at the hands of others.
That everyone is afraid. And that everyone realizes that they are also lucky.
That everyone has an impulse to make things better, to connect and to contribute.
That everyone wants something that they can't possibly have. And if they could have it, they'd discover that they didn't really want it all along.
That everyone is lonely, insecure and a bit of a fraud. And that everyone cares about something.
Sonder might happen to you. When it does, it will help you see the world in a whole new way. Because, if you let it, the feeling can persist. A feeling that can allow you to see others the way you'd like to be seen.","October 13, 2017","sonder, empathy, human experience"

Oppositional,"When someone is frequently naysaying a proposal or a situation, it's tempting to figure out how to make them happy. What can you change to find a compromise, how can you listen to their objections and respond in a way to gain their approval?
It might be, though, that being oppositionalismaking them happy. It may be that the best way to satisfy their objections is to let them keep objecting.","October 11, 2017","Oppositional, objections, compromise"
The problem with high expectations…,"is that nothing will ever be good enough.
But the alternative, low expectations, is sad indeed.
The internet (like life) will always disappoint us. It will always be too flaky, too slow, too insulated. It will always have errors, hate and stupidity. And we had such high hopes, the promise was so big.
This is true of just about everything, and it opens the door to the realization that we can be brokenhearted or we can use those high hopes as fuel to make the next cycle even better.
Some people persist on grading themselves on a curve, ensuring that they'll never be disappointed in what they create or in the opportunities they pass by. It's a form of hiding, not an accurate insight into what you're capable of. You deserve better than that.","October 10, 2017","high expectations, disappointment, self-worth"
The engine of our discontent,"When TV first was adopted, it was a magical gift. The shows united our culture and the ads fueled a seemingly endless consumer boom.
Today, though, marketers have turned television into an instrument of dissatisfaction. The shows alienate many, because they bring an idealized, expensive world into the homes of people who increasingly can't afford it. And the ads remind just about everyone that their lives are incomplete and unhappy–unless they buy what's on offer. Worse, cable news is optimized to shock, frighten and divide the people who watch it.
Social media can amplify all of these downward cycles. It's TV times 1,000.
Hence a middle class, millions of people who would be as rich as kings in any other time or place, that's angry and disappointed and feeling left behind. Victims of a media regime where they are both the user and the product.
Every time TV and social media become significant time sinks in a household, pleasure goes up and happiness goes down.

Confusing signals,"There are high-end products, like camera lenses, stereo speakers and cars where the conventional wisdom is that heavier is a signifier of better. It's so widely held that in many cases, manufacturers will intentionally make their products heavier merely to send a signal that they expect will be understood as quality.
And yet, in many cases, there are exceptional performers that completely contradict this belief. That the signal, which might have made sense before, doesn't actually hold true.
We do the same signal searching when we choose a book because it's been on a bestseller list, or a college because of its ranking, or a used car because of the way the interior smells and the door slams.
The same thing is true with the way we interview people for jobs. We think that a funny, calm person who looks like we do and interviews well is precisely the person who will perform the best. And, far more often than we'd expect, this is shown to be untrue.
We've all learned this the hard way, with charismatic people and with heavy stuff, too.

"Technical skills, power and influence","When a new technology arrives, it's often the nerds and the neophiliacs who embrace it. People who see themselves as busy and important often dismiss the new medium or tool as a bit of a gimmick and then ""go back to work.""
It's only a few years later when the people who understand those tools are the ones calling the shots. Because ""the work"" is now centered on that thing that folks hesitated to learn when they had the chance.
And so, it's the web programmers who hold the keys to the future of the business, or the folks who live in mobile. Or it's the design strategists who thrive in Photoshop and UI thinking who determine what gets built or invested in…

"If you can’t see it, how can you make it better?","It doesn't pay to say to the CFO: These numbers on the P&L aren't true.
And arguing with Walmart or Target about your market share stats doesn't work either.
You can't make things better if you can't agree on the data.
Real breakthroughs are sometimes accompanied by new data, by new metrics, by new ways of measurement. But unless we agree in advance on what's happening, it's difficult to accomplish much.
If you don't like what's happening, an easy way out appears to be to blame the messenger. After all, if the data (whether it's an event, a result or a law of physics) isn't true, you're off the hook.
The argument is pretty easy to make: if the data has ever been wrong before, if there's ever been bias, or a mistake, or a theory that's been improved, well, then, who's to say that it's right this time?
""Throw it all out."" That's the cowardly and selfish thing to do. Don't believe anything that makes you look bad. All video is suspect, as is anything that is reported, journaled or computed.
The problem is becoming more and more clear: once we begin to doubt the messenger, we stop having a clear way to see reality. The conspiracy theories begin to multiply. If everyone is entitled to their own facts and their own narrative, then what exists other than direct emotional experience?
And if all we've got is direct emotional experience, our particular statement of reality, how can we possibly make things better?
If we don't know what's happened, if we don't know what's happening, and worst of all, if we can't figure out what's likely to happen next, how do take action?
No successful organization works this way. It's impossible to imagine a well-functioning team of people where there's a fundamental disagreement about the data.
Demand that those you trust and those you work with accept the ref's calls, the validity of the x-ray and the reality of what's actually happening. Anything less than that is a shortcut to chaos.","October 6, 2017","data, reality, agreement"
Defining authenticity,"For me, it’s not “do what you feel like doing,” because that’s unlikely to be useful.
You might feel like hanging out on the beach, telling off your boss or generally making nothing much of value. Authenticity as an impulse is hardly something to aspire to.
It’s not, “say whatever is on your mind,” either.
Instead, I define it as, “consistent emotional labor.”
We call a brand or a personauthenticwhen they’re consistent, when they act the same way whether or not someone is looking. Someone is authentic when their actions are in alignment with what they promise.
Showing up as a pro.
Keeping promises.

"The pre-steal panic, and why it doesn’t matter","When I started as a book packager, there were 40,000 books published every year. Every single book I did, every single one, had a substitute.
Every time we had an idea, every time we were about to submit a proposal, we discovered that there was already a book on that topic. Someone else had 'stolen' my idea before I had even had it.
The only topics I invented that had never been published before were books I was unable to sell.
No one expects you to do something so original, so unique, so off the wall that it has never been conceived of before. In fact, if you do that, it's unlikely you will find the support you need to do much of anything with your idea.
Your ideas have all been stolen already.

You get the journey and you get the stress. At the end, you're a different person. But both elements are part of the deal.
There are plenty of journeys that are stress-free. They take you where you expect, with little in the way of surprise or disappointment. You can call that a commute or even a familiar TV show in reruns.
And there's plenty of stress that's journey-free. What a waste.

The pleasure/happiness gap,"Pleasure is short-term, addictive and selfish. It's taken, not given. It works ondopamine.
Happiness is long-term, additive and generous. It's giving, not taking. It works onserotonin.
This is not merely simple semantics. It's a fundamental difference in our brain wiring. Pleasure and happiness feel like they are substitutes for each other, different ways of getting the same thing. But they're not. Instead, they are things that are possible to get confused about in the short run, but in the long run, they couldn't be more different.
Both are cultural constructs. Both respond not only to direct, physical inputs (chemicals, illness) but more and more, to cultural ones, to the noise of comparisons and narratives.
Marketers usually sell pleasure. That's a shortcut to easy, repeated revenue. Getting someone hooked on the hit that comes from caffeine, tobacco, video or sugar is a business model. Lately, social media is using dopamine hits around fear and anger and short-term connection to build a new sort of addiction.
On the other hand, happiness is something that's difficult to purchase. It requires more patience, more planning and more confidence. It's possible to find happiness in the unhurried child's view of the world, but we're more likely to find it with a mature, mindful series of choices, most of which have to do with seeking out connection and generosity and avoiding the short-term dopamine hits of marketed pleasure.
More than ever before, we control our brains by controlling what we put into them. Choosing the media, the interactions, the stories and the substances we ingest changes what we experience. These inputs lead us to have a narrative, one that's supported by our craving for dopamine and the stories we tell ourselves. How could it be any other way?
Scratching an itch is a route to pleasure. Learning to productively live with an itch is part of happiness.
Perhaps we can do some hard work and choose happiness.

How much does it cost?,"It depends.
Before we can even begin to discuss the price (how much to charge), it's important to understand what something costs to make. And the answer isn't always obvious.
If you want to know how much it costs to make the first one, to scale the operation up, to get the machinery, the systems, the staff… it might be a million dollars for a piece of toast or a billiard ball. Perhaps ten million.
Or the question might be: How much does the last one off the assembly line cost? After the entire system is up and running, after everyone's been paid by everything else that was produced today—the last unit the shift produced, what's the marginal cost of that one? In the case of our mythical billiard ball, it might be just a nickel.
But maybe we're talking about this particular unit, the one that was hand sold, that was customized, that was delivered to precisely the right spot at precisely the right time—all of that just in time customization and risk reduction cost a fortune.
And what about the externalities? What does it cost the environment, the community, the team?
Finally, perhaps we ought to consider the opportunity cost. How much better would it have been for us to spend our time and our capital and our risk to do something else, something more useful or profitable?
In the long run, all we need to do is divide our total costs by the total number of units we made. But in the long run, we're all dead. In the short run, the cost depends on what sort of decision we're trying to make.","November 30, 2017","Cost, Pricing, Opportunity Cost"
Two kinds of practice,"The first is quite common. Learn to play the notes as written. Move asymptotically toward perfection. Practice your technique and your process to get yourself ever more skilled at doing it (whatever ‘it’ is) to spec. This is the practice of grand slalom, of arithmetic, of learning your lines or c++.
The other kind of practice is more valuable but far more rare. This is the practice of failure. Of trying on one point of view after another until you find one that works. Of creating original work that doesn’t succeed until it does. Of writing, oration and higher-level math in search of an elusive outcome, even a truth, one that might not even be there.
We become original through practice.
We’ve seduced ourselves into believing that this sort of breakthrough springs fully formed, as Athena did from Zeus’ head. Alas, that’s a myth. What always happens (as you can discover by looking at the early work of anyone you admire), is that she practiced her way into it.","November 29, 2017","practice, failure, originality"

Getting clear about risk,"There are potential horrible things in the future, perhaps your future or mine.
Unthinkable illnesses, weird accidents, lightning bolts of misfortune at random moments.
If you decide to focus on them, you can fill your days with despair.
On the other hand, pretending that it's not stupid to text while driving, to swim during a thunderstorm or to ride a bike without a helmet is dangerous indeed. Our awareness of potential bad outcomes can cause us to make really good choices to avoid those outcomes.
So, what's the difference between being concerned about an asteroid hitting the Earth and being aware of how dangerous driving a Corvair at high speed is?
Here's the simple approach:How much would it cost you (in time, money, effort, distraction) to make yourself ten times less likely to be at risk?
It turns out that wearing a helmet is a cheap way to avoid a lifetime spine injury. You get a 10x improvement for very little effort. Knowing about the risk is really helpful, and any time you're tempted to run the risk, remind yourself of its implications.
On the other hand, the only way to becoming one-tenth as likely to die from choking on food is to stop eating anything but soup. Hardly worth it.
If there isn't a way to improve your odds, it's not clear why it's worth a lot of time or worry.
Worry is useful when it changes our behavior in productive ways. The rest of the time, it's a negative form of distraction, an entertainment designed to keep us from doing our work and living our lives.","November 25, 2017","risk awareness, decision-making, worry management"
The last Black Friday,"Four years ago, I wrote about themedia trapthat retailers invented. With nothing much to write about the day after Thanksgiving, the media engage in a stampede to encourage everyone to go shopping on the busiest, least satisfying shopping day of the year. They spent millions to create a social dynamic that pushes people to engage in an orgy of spending, merely because everyone else is.
I think Amazon may have changed this forever.
As the malls continue to die, as retailers everywhere struggle to come up with a reason why people should spend extra time and extra money to visit them, the herd dynamic of Black Friday is fading. It's hard to whip yourself into a frenzy when you're sitting at home, in your bathrobe, staring at a screen.
In their race to out-Walmart Walmart, retailers everywhere forgot the real reason we need stores. Because shopping together makes us feel connected. Because it's fun. Because there's something about the shopping that's almost as good (or even better) than the buying part.
The buying race is over. Amazon won. The shopping race, though, the struggle to create experiences that are worth paying for, that's just beginning.","November 24, 2017","Black Friday, retail changes, shopping experiences"
Thank you means two things,"There's the ""thank you"" that I say when you've been reading my mind, pushing the perfect buttons, saying exactly the right thing at exactly the right time. This is heartfelt, but it's also selfish, in that it's about my narrative and no one else's.
And then there's the ""thank you"" of caring. Of effort. Of consideration. This is the thank you that recognizes the other, her effort, her kindness and her sacrifice. The thank you of showing up. This thank you has nothing at all to do with whether it's just what you wanted, and everything to do with the power of connection and care.
Have a wonderfulholiday. And thank you, both ways.","November 23, 2017","gratitude, connection, kindness"
Best practices,"If you need an appendectomy, it's unlikely you'll die during the operation.
That's because the surgeon has been trained in hundreds of years of best practices. From Semmelweis to the latest in antibiotics, she knows what's come before.
Not only that, but the scalpel she uses is the result of 1,000 iterations over the centuries. Every device has been sanitized based on trial and error from the millions of patients who came before you.
Surgery is an engineering project, and it's based on best practices. Learn from the past, don't ignore it.
Art, on the other hand, is something we value because it leaps. Art is more than engineering–art is the thing that might not work.
But even art is based on best practices. Just not as much.
The playwright better have read Bellow and Beckett. The conceptual artist should be familiar with Duchamp. The photographer and designer needs to know Debbie Millman, Robert Mapplethorpe and Jill Greenberg…
Ignore it if you want to, but learn it first.","November 22, 2017","Best practices, surgery, art"
Yelling upstairs,"When you’re cooking breakfast and the school bus is coming in just a few minutes, it’s tempting (and apparently efficient) to yell up the stairs. If a recalcitrant teenager is hesitating before heading off to school (I know, sometimes it happens), go ahead and yell.
Good luck with that.
The alternative is to turn off the stove and walk up the stairs. Catch your breath, then have a quiet conversation.
Not efficient, but effective.
This is an almost universal metaphor. We keep finding ways to rationalize various versions of yelling upstairs instead of doing the difficult work of engaging instead.","November 21, 2017","communication, parenting, effectiveness"

Persistent stability,"Investment hates chaos.
Before an organization invests in a new technology, a new machine or a new process, it needs to believe two things:
That's why a consistent, civil and stable government matters so much. And why industries often wait to leap into a new technology. Before there are any conversations at all about ROI, decision makers need to feel safe, safe enough to believe that there will a future that matches their expectations.",,"Stability, Investment, Technology"
The boss goes first,"If you want to build a vibrant organizational culture, or govern with authority, or create a social dynamic that's productive and fair, the simple rule is: the rules apply to people in power before they are applied to those without.
It's easy to rationalize the alternative, to put yourself first. After all, you've somehow earned the authority to make an exception for yourself.
But when we avoid that temptation and expose ourselves to the rules first, obey the rules first and make the sacrifices first, our culture is more likely to stick.
The rules that matter the most are the ones about behavior, transparency and accountability.
People might hear what you say, but they always remember what you do.","November 19, 2017","organizational culture, accountability, leadership"
Like Mary Shelley,"When she wroteFrankenstein, it changed everything. A different style of writing. A different kind of writer. And the use of technology in ways that no one expected and that left a mark.
Henry Ford did that. One car and one process after another, for decades. Companies wanted to be the Ford of _____. Progress makes more progress easier. Momentum builds. But Ford couldn't make the streak last. The momentum gets easier, but the risks feel bigger too.
Google was like that. Changing the way we used mail and documents and the internet itself. Companies wanted to be the Google of _____. And Apple was like that, twice with personal computers, then with the phone. And, as often happens with public companies, they both got greedy.
Tesla is still like that. They're the new Ford. Using technology in a conceptual, relentless, and profound fashion to remake industries and expectations, again and again. Take a breakthrough, add a posture, apply it again and again. PS Audio is like that in stereos, and perhaps you could be like that…  The Mary Shelley of ____.","November 18, 2017","Innovation, Technology, Disruption"
The simple truth about net neutrality,"It's not that complicated.
It's based in history, it involves money and fairness and control.
But it's not that complicated.
If you care about the details, it's worth reading this classic fromTim Wu. There's no debate about how we got here, and not even that much debate about where it leads. It's mostly about who has the power to control the access that you and others have to the information and interactivity that drives our lives.
Ifnet neutralityin the US is taken away, everyone will pay more, service will cease to be universal, the poor will lose something they need more than ever, and some lobbyists will be very happy.

Five contributions,"Each one matters, each is intentional, each comes with effort, preparation and reward:
Leader: The pathfinder, able to get from here to there, to connect in service of a goal. Setting an agenda, working in the dark, going new places and tackling unknowable obstacles.
Manager: Leveraging the work of others, coordinating and completing, with a focus on taking responsibility. The leader can set an agenda, the manager makes the countless decisions to ensure it gets completed. It's been done before, but you can do it better.
Salesperson: Turning a maybe into a yes, enrolling prospects in the long-term journey of value creation.
Craftsperson: Using hands or a keyboard to do unique work that others can't (or won't).
Contributor: Showing up and doing what you're asked to do, keeping promises made on your behalf.
I'm sure that I missed a few, but I'm not describing job titles, I'm describing a posture. When you decide what to do next, that decision reveals your sense of what's the next best contribution you can make. What do you see, who are you waiting for, how do you know if it's working, what do you need to learn, where is the leverage and who can help?
Yes, these aresoft skills, real skills, the skills and attitudes that actually matter. It's up to each of us to decide how much we'll show up, how much we'll contribute.
What would it look like if your contribution was truly significant?",,"Contribution, Leadership, Collaboration"
The confusion about competence,"A friend was describing a clerk he had recently dealt with. ""She was competent, of course, but she couldn't engage very well with the customer who just came in.""
Then, of course, she wasn't competent, was she?
It doesn't take a genius to see that competence is no longer about our ability to press certain buttons in a certain sequence. Far more often, competence involves the humanity required to connect with other people, in real time.
It requires emotional labor, not merely compliance.","November 16, 2017","competence, emotional labor, customer engagement"
Outsiders,"You can't have insiders unless you have outsiders.
And you can't have winners unless you have losers.
That doesn't mean that you're required to create insiders and winners. All it means is that when people begin to measure themselves only in comparison to others (""How did I rank?"") then you need to accept the impact of those choices.
It's entirely possible to be happy and engaged and productive without creating this dynamic. But in a culture based on scarcity, it's often easier to award or deduct points and to keep a scoreboard instead.","November 15, 2017","outsiders, insiders, competition"
Meaningful work,"Of course, it came with chocolate.
There's no doubt that we're doing more running around than ever before. More cutting of corners, counting of pennies, reading of reviews. More focus on making a profit, less on making a difference.
But why?
Once you have enough, isn't better the point?
Better doesn't mean more. Better means generous, sustainable, worthy. Better means connection and quality and opportunity, too.
This lesson is easily learned from chocolate. Not merely because there's a limited amount you can eat at a time (so why not eat something better), but because the creation of chocolate gives us a startling insight into justice, fairness and what it means to do work that matters.
The numbers associated with chocolate are huge. Tons of cacao, millions of bars, billions in revenue. But one number is astonishingly small: the amount the typical farmer makes in income. For many, it's only $3 a day. The people who are creating the raw material for the magic we consume daily are among some of the poorest and least respected workers in the world.
My friend Shawn has written a groundbreaking book that might just change everything for you. Not merely the way you eat chocolate, but the way you do your work.
It publishes today atAmazonand800CEOReadas well. Shawn has used his life (from defense attorney to creator of some of the most amazing chocolate in the world) as a way to think about the work we do all day. How do we do it, why do we do it, what do we measure…
A must read. It will help you see the world differently.
PS Emily and Maya and their team atUncommon Cacaoare putting some of these insights to work in a brave and powerful new way. As soon as someone says, ""there's no other way,"" count on someone who cares to find another way.

Full vs. enough,"One of the lessons of Thanksgiving is that we eat too much. We eat until we're full, experiencing the sensation of too much.
It's easy to confuse our desire for that that feeling with the feeling of 'enough'. Enough doesn't feel like full, but that's okay.
Too often, we've been persuaded by marketers and other maximizers that the only satisfying state is 'full.' Not just in what we've eaten, but in what we own, control or receive.
In fact, full doesn't last and full isn't desirable. No thanks, I've got enough. It's better that way.
[The US Thanksgiving is right around the corner. Today's a good day to revisit the (now) classicThanksgiving Reader. It's free to print, free to share and a nice part of the celebration for families everywhere.]","November 13, 2017","Thanksgiving, enough, consumption"
Been done before,"What percentage of the work you do each day is work where the process (the 'right answer') is known? Jobs where you replicate a process instead of inventing one…
The place where we can create the most value is when we do a job where exploration and a new solution is what's needed. Not rote, but exploration. Which means we're doing something that's not been done before, something that might not work.
This isn't something to avoid, it's the work we need to seek out.","November 12, 2017","exploration, innovation, value creation"
Speakerphone voice,"When the speakerphone is on in the conference room, do you talk differently?
It's pretty common.
We breathe from a different spot, hold our chest differently, constrict our throats and generally try to shout our words across the ocean.
The people listening on the speaker are used to it. The people in the room with you, less so.
Human beings don't have a long cultural history with microphones. We don't instinctively understand that they actually work. So we shout instead. And shouting changes how we're believed, trusted and ultimately heard.
Learning to use a microphone is a great skill. When you speak normally, it turns out that the microphone has plenty of volts, watts and amps on hand to move your voice all the way to Latvia if you want it to. And then your words will actually be heard.","November 11, 2017","Speakerphone, communication, microphone skills"

Disastorino,"Elections are the only place where marketers try to get fewer people to buy what's being sold.
In many elections in the US, fewer than half the population votes. Which means, of course, that in most elections, not only doesn't the winner get a majority, the winner wasn't even chosen by a majority of the majority. We make itworsewith gerrymandering and arcane vote counting.
It turns out that depressing voter turnout is a shortcut for the selfish political marketer. It's easier to get your opponent's supporters to become disgusted enough to stay home than it is to actually encourage people to proactively vote for you.
When non-electoral marketers try to learn from political examples, we get confused by all of this. The fact that it's a one-shot event, that a bare majority is the goal (most marketing doesn't have to win a majority, it merely needs to matter toenoughpeople) and that decreasing turnout is a valid strategy all add up to make politics a special case.
Blue Bottle Coffee doesn't succeed against Starbucks by getting people to not drink coffee at all. Nor do they need to sell more than half the coffee sold. All that a non-political marketer needs to do is find enough raving fans. If politicians learned this lesson, I think we'd all be better off.
It's not an accident we're disgusted. Politicians spend billions of marketing dollars to create the belief that voting is something that's better to avoid.
They teach us that it's not a responsibility we want to take.
They make it feel like a hassle.
They don't invest in making it a chance to build community and connection.
In short, it's more like giving blood and less like going to a Super Bowl party.
Too often the incumbents are liked by a minority, respected by an even smaller group and particularly bad at the job. And if many of the registered voters turned out, each would lose in a heartbeat.
The solution is simple, fast and cheap.Show up and vote.Every time.
Once politicians realize that we're immune to their cynical tricks, they'll stop using them.
Show up and vote. It'll make a difference.","November 7, 2017","voter turnout, political marketing, civic engagement"

The real law of averages,"If you want to raise the standards of any group, improving the top of the heap isn't nearly as effective as focusing your effort on the base instead.
Simple example: Getting a Prius to go from 50 miles per gallon to 55 miles per gallon isn't nearly as important as getting SUVs to go from 10 miles per gallon to 15. There are two reasons for this. The first is that there are a lot more SUVs than Priuses. The second is that they use far more gallons, so a percentage increase has far more yield. (You can't average averages).
If you care about health and a culture of performance, it's tempting to push Olympic athletes to go just a tenth of a second faster. It's far more effective, though, if you can get 3,000,000 kids to each spend five more minutes a day walking instead of sitting.
Organizations pamper and challenge the few in the executive suite, imagining that one more good decision in the biz dev group could pay off. The thing is, if every one of the 10,000 customer-facing employees was more engaged and kind, it would have a far bigger impact on the company and those it serves.
I think the reason we focus on the few is that it feels more dramatic, seems more controllable and is ultimately easier. But the effective, just and important thing to do is to help the back of the line catch up.","November 3, 2017","law of averages, engagement, performance improvement"

Many of them came hoping that they'd learn some new techniques from me in the fifty videos that are included.
Most of them were surprised.
They were surprised to discover that while there are tons of useful tactics and approaches in the videos, the real power of the Seminar is helping people see what's possible. The peer-to-peer connection that's built deep into the Seminar means that you'll spend far more time giving and getting feedback than you will watching videos.
It's this powerful interaction that changes the game.This is a future of education—community plus content.
We each carry around a frying pan, looking for just the right size fish to fry. We each have an expectation of what we've got, what we might get and what we deserve. And most of all, we each carry around limits, beliefs about what we're able to contribute.

We have to make choices like this every single day. What color, among three colors which are just fine. Which route, between two routes within a rounding error in time taken. Which flight, which table, which person…
Choices don't have to be decisions.
Decisions come with all sorts of overhead. We put a lot of weight on our ability to make good decisions. We switch frames, put in hard work and even involve emotional wishes about future outcomes. Decisions are fraught. That weight can pay off with a more serious approach, with more diligence, but mostly it weighs us down.
We can save a lot of time and effort by making our meaningless choices effortless. Pick the first one, or the one in alphabetical order or flip a coin. Merely have a rule and make the choice.
I'm serious. Considering ten colleges? Put your favorite five in a hat and randomly pick one. Done. Can't decide among three candidates for a job and you can't find a way to choose? Pick the one with the shortest first name. Why not? If you don't have enough information to make a statistically defensible decision, merely choose.

We're goal-directed, risk-averse and self-focused. We don't care about the salesperson's commission, of course. We care about our own resources.
The magic happens when the goals are aligned, when the service component of sales kicks in, when long-term satisfaction exceeds short-term urgency.
When someone acts in a way that says, ""can I help you buy something?"" or, ""can I help you achieve your goals?"" then we're on our way. And of course, it's the doing, not the saying that matters the most.","December 21, 2017","sales, consumer behavior, alignment"
Make better tacos,"In a competitive business like the local taco shop, here's how it's supposed to work:
Keep the place clean
Hire friendly staff
Make better tacos
Offer a fun, connected, even memorable experience
What often happens instead is that you coin some clevertrademarks, worry about coupons, cut corners on ingredients and expand as fast as you can. What happens is that you build a moat around your business, get defensive about the status quo and race to the bottom. You're generic now, and you fight the battles that being generic forces you to fight.
And it's not just a business that makes tacos. It's monopolistic internet access, freelance graphic design and everything in between.
When in doubt, make better tacos.","December 20, 2017","tacos, business strategy, customer experience"
Local scarcity,"If you ran the local 5 and 10 cent store, you could count on a steady stream of customers to buy your knick knacks, notions and bobbins. After all, you were the only game in town.
And if you were the local Chinese restaurant, your delivery zone was just the right size that the only option some had for moo shu was you.
Local scarcity was sufficient for coaches, travel agents, real estate brokers, lawn care specialists and car washes.
But in the age of Amazon and online services, only the car wash and the Chinese restaurant are insulated now.

Open or closed?,"Culture moves in two ways. Open and closed.
If you're a teacher, in business, a politician, a parent, a leader, an oligarch, a media mogul, an oil baron, a salesperson or a marketer, you need to make a choice, a choice that will alter how you work with others and the investments you make in our culture and your craft: Do you benefit from a population that's smarter, faster and more connected than it used to be?
Do you prefer transparency?
Either you're riding the tide or pushing against it.
Are you hoping that those you serve become more informed or less informed?
Are you working to give people more autonomy or less?
Do you want them to work to seek the truth, or to be clouded in disbelief and confusion?
Is it better if they're connected to one another or disconnected?
More confidence or more fear?
Outspoken in the face of injustice or silent?
More independent or less?
Difficult to control or easier?
More science or more obedience?
It's pretty clear that there are forces on both sides, individuals and organizations that are working for open and those that seek to keep things closed instead.
Take a side.","December 18, 2017","Open vs. closed, Transparency, Autonomy"

The drip,"Change, real change, is the result of focused persistence.
It's easy to get a bunch of people sort of excited for a little while.
The challenging part, and the reason that change doesn't happen as often as it should is that we get distracted. Today's urgent is more urgent than yesterday's important.
The concept of breaking news and the crisis of the day proves my point. If the world ended every time Wolf Blitzer implied it would, we would have been toast a long time ago. The organizations that actually change things are the ones that have a time horizon that's longer than 36 hours.
There are very few overnight successes. Very few entrepreneurs, freelancers, non-profits, candidates, spiritual leaders, activists or people in a successful relationship that got there with thunder and lighting. It happens with a drip.

Modern laziness,"The original kind of lazy avoids hard physical work. Too lazy to dig a ditch, organize a warehouse or clean the garage.
Modern lazy avoids emotional labor. This is the laziness of not raising your hand to ask the key question, not caring about those in need or not digging in to ship something that might not work. Lazy is having an argument instead of a thoughtful conversation. Lazy is waiting until the last minute. And lazy is avoiding what we fear.
Lazy feels okay in the short run, but eats at us over time.

The minimum critical mass,"For your idea to spread, your app to go viral, your restaurant to be the place, it's likely you'll need to hit critical mass.
This is a term from physics, describing the amount of plutonium you need in a certain amount of space before a nuclear reaction becomes self-sustaining.
Once enough people start driving your new brand of motorcycle around town, it's seen by enough people that it becomes accepted, and sales take off from there.
Once enough people who know enough people start talking about your new app, the touchpoints multiply and organic growth kicks in.
Once enough readers read and engage with your book, it's no longer up to the bookstore to push it… people talking to people are the engine for your growth.
It's sort of the opposite of Yogi Berra saying, ""No one goes there, it's too crowded."" When you hit the right number of conversations, the buzz creates its own buzz, popularity and usage creates more popularity and usage.
The thing is, though, most marketers are fooling themselves. They imagine that the audience size necessary for critical mass is right around the corner, but it's actually closer to infinity. That, like a boat with a leak, you always have to keep bailing to keep it afloat. If you don't design for a low critical mass, you're unlikely to get one.
This is why most apps don't ever take off. Not because they weren't launched with enough fanfare, not because the developers didn't buy enough promotion or installs—because ther0of virality is less than one. Because every time you add 10 users, you don't get a cycle that goes up in scale, you get one that gradually decays instead.
The hard work of marketing, then, isn't promoting that thing you made. It's in building something where the Minimum Critical Mass is a low enough number that you can actually reach it.
Facebook, one of the finest examples available, only needed 100 users in one Harvard social circle for it to gain enough traction to take the campus, and then jump to the Ivy League, and then, eventually, to you.
My bookPurple Cowwas seeded to about 5,000 readers. That was all the direct promotion it needed to eventually make its way to millions of readers around the world.
How many people needed to start carrying a Moleskine or selfie stick or a pair of Grados before you decided you needed one too?
Yes, of course, sometimes the route to popular is random, or accidental. And betting on lucky is fine, as long as you know that's what you're doing. But the best marketers do three things to increase their chances:
Making your MCM a manageable number is the secret to creating a hit.","December 6, 2017","Critical Mass, Virality, Marketing Strategies"
The big squeeze,"There are more truck drivers in the US than just about any other occupation.
For a long time, unionized truck drivers benefitted from work rules, healthcare, vacations, etc. It wasn't an easy job to get, but it was a career.
Companies started to realize that if they offloaded the work to freelance truckers, people with their own rigs, they could take advantage of a free market. As a result, more and more of the work ended up with independent operators, who got to be their own boss, paying for their own equipment, finding their own work. (HT)
The problem, exacerbated by the speed and power of the internet, is that there's always someone cheaper and hungrier than you are. That if you do undifferentiated work, the market will squeeze you to do it cheaper.
We get (slightly) cheaper trucking. The millions of drivers get exhausted while living right on the edge. They work too many hours, carry too much weight, burn themselves out.
And the same thing is true for anyone who signs up to be a cog in a digital marketplace. Uber drivers, freelance bottom-fishers, hard-working people cranking things out by the pound…
Any market that seems to offer an easy in to the undifferentiated will eventually squeeze them.","December 5, 2017","Truck drivers, freelance work, market squeeze"
Reading at work,"Most organizations think nothing of having twenty valuable employees spend an hour in a meeting that's only tangentially related to their productive output.

What would happen if the next all hands meeting got cancelled and instead the organization had an all hands-on read instead?

How does the ball know?,"""Follow through.""
That's the advice you'll hear in golf, in tennis and in baseball. That your follow through changes everything.
But how can it? After all, the ball is long gone by the time you're done with your swing.
Here's the thing: In order tonotfollow through, you need to start slowing down before you're done hitting the ball. The follow through isn't the goal, it's the symptom that you did something right.
And of course, the same thing is true of that conference you run, or the customer service you provide, or the way you engage with a class or a job… if you begin slowing down before the last moment, the last moment is going to suffer.","December 3, 2017","Follow through, performance, momentum"
Your soft skills inventory,"The annual review is a waste. It's not particularly useful for employee or boss, it's stressful and it doesn't happen often enough to make much of an impact.
If you choose to, though, you can do your own review. Weekly or monthly, you can sit down with yourself (or, more powerfully, with a small circle of peers) and review how you're shifting your posture to make more of an impact.
Some of the things to ask:
What am I better at?
Have I asked a difficult question lately?
Do people trust me more than they did?
Am I hiding more (or less) than I did the last time I checked?
Is my list of insightful, useful and frightening stats about my work, my budgets and my challenges complete? And have I shared it with someone I trust?
If selling ideas is a skill, am I more skilled at it than I was?
Who have I developed?
Have I had any significant failures (learning opportunities) lately, and what have I learned?
What predictions have I made that have come to pass? Am I better at seeing what's going to happen next?
Who have I helped? Especially when there was no upside for me…
Am I more likely to be leading or following?","December 2, 2017","soft skills, self-review, personal growth"
The most important journeys come without a map,"That's why we need to care enough to make assertions.
We're taught to follow instructions, to avoid significant risk and to be good at compliance. The system prefers it that way, at least when things aren't in flux. But we can learn to make assertions instead.
Every once in awhile, we see a change in the world and have the chance to speak up, to lay out a plan, to make an argument about how to proceed.We have a chance to lead.
And so we built thealtMBA. To help people practice the skill of making assertions.
An assertion begins with your take on the world, but it also requires action. It has to be open to debate. An informed team member should be able to disagree with you, and your engagement with them can make your assertion even more insightful and powerful.
But it's not easy.
If you make an assertion, you might be wrong.And if you make an assertion, someone might ask you to dig deeper, or to run with it and lead.And if you take action, you might not succeed.And failure is no fun.
But assertions are the real work. To take a stand and make a principled argument. Not merely a matter of opinion, but your take on where to drive, even when you don’t have a map handy.
Every session of the altMBA has been fully subscribed. It's an intensive workshop, a peer-driven opportunity to see differently, choose differently and learn to do work that truly matters.
The next available session is this spring, and we're acceptingapplicationsnow. Please don't wait too long–if you apply this week, we'll let you know soon and you can plan around it. This is the best time to plan for the next time.

Your corner of the sphere,"What sort of novel do you want to write?
What does your restaurant offer?
What about that new record you're recording?
It's tempting indeed for you to seek to be high quality, low priced, durable, with excellent service, less filling, better taste, poetic phrasing, conveniently located, powerful characters and organic. All at once.
But that's not how humans process what you have to offer.
Consider some classic, bestselling novels or memoirs.Snow Crashmatters because of the ideas within. Harry Potter worked because the plot kept kids riveted. The language in Patti Smith'sJust Kidsis perfect, and the characters inTo Kill a Mockingbirdare unforgettable. Of course, each book has the other elements in some measure, but it's the one thing that sticks with us.
Zappos might have good prices, but it's the service we talk about. Tom's might have fashionable shoes, but it's the pay it forward that resonates. And your iPhone might have good download speed, but it's the design and fashion that we pay for.
All a way of helping you think about the many disconnected points on the edge of the sphere in your industry. Pick one to exceed expectations in, while making sure everything else is good enough.

A country for con men,"The medicine show hypester, the confidence man, the snake oil salesman… my country has a long history of marketers of ill repute.
The reason is simple: we spent two hundred years spreading out over the continent, and unlike Europe, strangers were common. Everyone was coming and going, and it wasn’t unusual at all to engage with someone you didn’t know.
The downside of this openness are all the people who took advantage of it. A tradition that continues to this day.
In the rush to expand, people embraced the idea of the big win. They named their ranch Bonanza, or their town Prospector. They drilled for gushers, invested in penny stocks, and took expensive placebos…
The upside is that being receptive to new ideas, even those too good to be true (especially those) creates a tradition of neophilia and optimism. When someone has a breakthrough—an innovation that actually keeps its promise—it’s much more likely to catch on.
The downside is pretty obvious.
And so we have to remain vigilant, teach our friends and customers to be on alert, and push regulators to take care, because there’s still a con artist on every corner.","January 30, 2018","con men, deception, optimism"

Perhaps we ought to spend more time being proactive.

The campus you spent four years on thirty years ago makes very little contribution to the job you're going to do. Here's what matters: The way you approach your work.

Never smooth enough–a modern addiction,"Once our needs are met, our instinct is to invent new ones, to find a fuel to continually move things forward, to bring that propulsive energy back.
Social media makes it easy to be both dissatisfied and to have a mission at the same time: Make everyone happy.
Every single critic silenced. Every customer delighted. Every prospect interested.
Sort of like your footprint in social media. It's imperfectible. There is someone, right now, who's miffed at you. Someone who misunderstands you. Someone who used to work with you who doesn't any more, or someone who has the wrong impression of you and won't even give you a chance. Not to mention the trolls, the ones who merely seek oppositional positions.
It's imperfectible.

Working with a designer (four paths),"Most of us want to look good online, need a website, maybe even a logo. More and more individuals and organizations are discovering that they need to hire a professional.
It comes down to doing your homework. Be clear with yourself before you spend a nickel or a minute with a designer. This difficult internal conversation will save you endless frustration and heartache later.
Here are four postures to consider in working with a good (or great) designer:","January 23, 2018","Designer, website, collaboration"
Hope and reality,"Sometimes, we don't sell what we've got, we sell what could be.
Book publishers, for example, buy non-fiction book proposals ($10 million for Bruce Springsteen's autobiography) not the finished book. The finished book almost never matches what they were hoping for, but the hoping is fun.
Venture capitalists, at least in the early stages of a company, buy hope as well. The numbers that might be, that could be, not the numbers you have now.
Understanding this, it's possible to draw a curve of hope and reality, over time. You need to be on a course toward the reality you seek, but bringing on partners is most effective when hope is ascending, not after reality sets in.","January 22, 2018","hope, reality, investment"
The gap,"There's a gap between where you are and where you want to be.
Many gaps, in fact, but imagine just one of them.
That gap–is it fuel? Are you using it like a vacuum, to pull you along, to inspire you to find new methods, to dance with the fear?
Or is it more like a moat, a forbidding space between you and the future?","January 21, 2018","gap, inspiration, fear"
Listening clearly,"It's entirely possible that people aren't listening closely to you any more.
There's so much noise, so much clutter… hoping that customers, prospects, vendors and co-workers will stop what they're doing and listen closely and carefully enough to figure out what you mean is a recipe for frustration.
Perhaps there's an alternative. Maybe, instead of insisting that people listen more closely, you could speak more clearly.
That's what great design and great copy do. They speak clearly so that people don't have to listen so hard.","January 20, 2018","listening, clarity, communication"
Your social thermometer,"Would you rather be the smartest person in the room or the least informed?
If you're the smartest, you can generously teach others. On the other hand, if you're the least informed and hungry to level up, you couldn't ask for a better place to be.
When you walk into a room, do you look around to see if you're the best dressed, the tallest, the most powerful, the richest, the prettiest, the best connected? Or are you hoping that people with some of those attributes are there, ready to share what they know with you?
Some people walk three steps behind the group, no matter how fast the group is walking. Others will tire themselves out, throwing elbows if necessary, to be first in line. Some people interrupt a lot, others are begging to be interrupted.
This changes over time, day by day even, depending on what we're looking for. And it happens in just about all the social settings in our lives. The challenge is finding a place that creates the change you seek. Too often, we go to conferences or parties or professional events where everyone is looking for someone other than us. Someone they can dominate or brush up against, someone they know or want to pitch…
It's easy to decide to level up.It takes guts to put yourself into a mix where it's actually going to happen.
Today's the last day for early applications for the April session of thealtMBA. More than 1,800 people have enrolled in sessions of our small-group workshop so far, and it might be worth considering. After Monday, applicants pay a higher tuition.

"Freedom, fairness and equality","Freedomdoesn't mean no responsibility. In fact, it requiresextraresponsibility. Freedom is the ability to make a choice, and responsibility is required once you make that choice.
Fairnessisn't a handout. Fairness is the willingness to offer dignity to others. The dignity of being seen and heard, and having a chance to make a contribution.
Andequalitydoesn't mean equal. Equality doesn't guarantee me a starting position on the Knicks. Equality means equality of access, the opportunity to do my best without being disqualified for irrelevant reasons.","January 18, 2018","Freedom, Fairness, Equality"
Perfect vs. important,"Is there a conflict?
Does holding something back as you polish it make it more likely that you'll create something important?
I don't think so. There's no apparent correlation.
Instead, what we see is that, all things being equal, polished is better than rushed, but the most important factor is whether or not you've actually done the work to make something remarkable/generous/challenging/useful/artful.

Please don’t kill the blogs,"An open note to Google
To the gmail team,
You've built a tool for a billion people. Most of my blog readers use it every day, and so do I. Thanks for creating an effective way for people to connect to the people and ideas they care about.
That comes with responsibility. The same responsibility that the postal service has… to deliver the mail.
I'm aware that you don't charge the people who use gmail for the privilege. In fact, we're the product, not the customer. Your goal is to keep people within the Google ecosystem and to get the writers and marketers who use email as a permission asset to instead shift to paying money (to Google) to inform and reach their audience.
So you invented the 'promotions' folder.
It seems like a great idea. That spam-like promo mail, all that stuff I don't want to read now (and probably ever) will end up there. Discounts on shoes. The latest urgent note from someone I don't even remember buying from. The last time I checked, you've moved more than 100,000 messages to my promotions folder. Without asking.
Alas, you've now become achoke point.You take the posts from this blog and dump them into my promo folder–and the promo folder of more than a hundred thousand people who never asked you to hide it.
Emails from my favorite charities end up in my promo folder.The Domino Projectblog goes there as well. Emails from Medium, from courses I've signed up for, from services I confirmed just a day earlier. Items sent with full permission, emails that by most definitions aren't ""promotions.""
Here's a simple way to visualize it: Imagine that your mailman takes all the magazines you subscribe to, mixes them in with the junk mail you never asked for, and dumps all of it in a second mailbox, one that you don't see on your way into the house every day. And when you subscribe to new magazines, they instantly get mixed in as well.
It's simple: blogs aren't promotions. Blogs subscribed to shouldn't be messed with. The flow of information by email is an extraordinary opportunity, and when a choke point messes with that to make a profit, things break.
The irony of having a middleman stealpermissionis not lost on me. That's what you're doing. You're not serving your customers because you're stealing the permission that they've given to providers they care about it. And when publishers switch to SMS or Facebook Messenger, that hardly helps your cause.
The solution is simple: Create a whitelist. Include the top 10,000 blogs (you probably still have the list from when you shut down Google Reader). Make the algorithm smarter, and make it easier for your users to let you know about the emails that are important enough to be in their inbox. When an email sender shows up regularly, it's probably a smart idea to ask before unilaterally shifting it to the promo folder.
Of course, users are free to choose a different email client. Alas, senders aren't. And as a publisher, it hurts me that I can't keep the promise I've made to my readers.
And, while you're upgrading the system, what's up with all the weird sexspamwe've been getting the last four months? It doesn't seem that difficult to distinguish it from actual human emails…
Google and Facebook are now the dominant middlemen for more than 85% of all online advertising. Along the way, Google has also dominated much of the email communication on the planet.  You get all the money but I think you need to up your game in return.
Thanks in advance for fixing this.
My readers want to get the stuff they asked to get. You probably do too.
[UPDATE: Thanks to everyone who contacted me after this post went live. I heard from hundreds of bloggers, writers, readers and others that were concerned about deliverability and the viability of email as a reliable communications tool. I also heard from a few folks on the Gmail team at Google. I'm pleased to let you know that we had a really productive conversation, and they're more aware than ever of the importance of effectively sorting the mail to serve their users. Along the way, they shared a bit about the new work they're doing in revamping the Promotions tab, a project that they're optimistic and enthusiastic about to make the tab more valuable to users and marketers alike. I'll keep you posted.]","January 16, 2018","Gmail, blogs, deliverability"
The four elements of entrepreneurship,"Are successful entrepreneurs made or born?
We’d need to start with an understanding of what an entrepreneur is. They’re all over the map, which makes the question particularly difficult to navigate.
There’s the 14-year-old girl who hitches a ride to Costco, buys 100 bottles of water for thirty cents each, then sells them at the beach for a dollar a pop. Scale that that every day for a summer and you can pay for college.
Or the 7-time venture-backed software geek who finds a niche, gets some funding, builds it out with a trusted team, sells it for $100 million in stock and then starts again.
Perhaps we’re talking about a non-profit entrepreneur, a woman who builds a useful asset, finds a scalable source of funding and changes the world as she does.
The mistake that’s easy to make is based in language. We say, “she’s an entrepreneur,” when we should be saying, “she’s acting like an entrepreneur.”
Since entrepreneurship is a verb, an action, a posture… then of course, it’s a choice. You might notwantto act like one, but if you can model behavior, youcanact like one.
And what do people do when they’re acting like entrepreneurs?
1. They make decisions.
2. They invest in activities and assets that aren’t a sure thing.
3. They persuade others to support a mission with a non-guaranteed outcome.
4. This one is the most amorphous, the most difficult to pin down and thus the juiciest: They embrace (instead of run from) the work of doing things that might not work.
As far as I can tell, that’s it. Everything else you can hire.
Buying into an existing business by buying a franchise, to pick one example–there’s very little of any of the four elements of entrepreneurial behavior. Yes, you’re swinging for a bigger win, you’re investing risk capital, you’re going outside the traditional mainstream. But what you’re doing is buying a proven business, not acting like an entrepreneur. The four elements aren't really there. It's a process instead. Nothing wrong with that.
All four of these elements are unnatural to most folks. Particularly if you were good at school, you're not good at this. No right answers, no multiple choice, no findable bounds.
It's easy to get hung up on the ""risk taking"" part of it, but if you’re acting like an entrepreneur, you don’t feel like you’re taking a huge risk. Risks are what happens at a casino, where you have little control over the outcome. People acting like entrepreneurs, however, feel as though the four most important elements of their work (see above) are well within their control.
If you’re hoping someone can hand you a Dummies guide, giving you the quick steps, the guaranteed method, the way to turn this process into a job–well, you’ve just announced that you don’t feel like acting like an entrepreneur.
But before you walk away from it, give it a try. Entrepreneurial behavior isn't about scale, it's about a desire for a certain kind of journey.",,"entrepreneurship, risk-taking, entrepreneurial behavior"
"Justice and dignity, the endless shortage","You will never regret offering dignity to others.
We rarely get into trouble because we overdo our sense of justice and fairness. Not just us, but where we work, the others we influence. Organizations and governments are nothing but people, and every day we get a chance to become better versions of ourselves.
And yet… in the moments when we think no one is looking, when the stakes are high, we often forget. It's worth remembering that justice and dignity aren't only offered on behalf of others.
Offering people the chance to be treated the way we'd like to be treated benefits us too. It goes around.
The false scarcity is this: we believe that shutting out others, keeping them out of our orbit, our country, our competitive space—that this somehow makes things more easier for us.
And this used to be true. When there are 10 jobs for dockworkers, having 30 dockworkers in the hall doesn't make it better for anyone but the bosses.
But today, value isn't created by filling a slot, it's created by connection. By the combinations created by people. By the magic that comes from diversity of opinion, background and motivation. Connection leads to ideas, to solutions, to breakthroughs.
The false scarcity stated as, ""I don't have enough, you can't have any,"" is more truthfully, ""together, we can create something better.""
We know it's the right thing to do. It's also the smart thing.","January 15, 2018","Justice, Dignity, Connection"

A graph only exists to make a point. Its purpose is not to present all the information. Its purpose is not to be pretty.
Most of all, its purpose is not, ""well, they told me I needed to put a graph here.""

The witnesses and the participants,"Every history student knows about the tragedy of the commons. When farmers shared grazing land, no one had an incentive to avoid overgrazing, and without individual incentives, the commons degraded until it was useless.
We talk about this as if it's an inevitable law, a glitch in the system that prevents communities from gaining the benefits of shared resources.
Of course, that's not true.
Culture permits us to share all sorts of things without having them turn into tragedies. People are capable of standing up to the short-term profit motive, we're not powerless. We can organize and codify and protect.
It requires us to say, ""please don't,"" even more than, ""not me."" Culture can be the antidote to selfishness.
In fact, it's the only thing that is.","January 12, 2018","tragedy of the commons, culture, shared resources"
"First, de-escalate","It's very difficult to reason with someone if their hair is on fire. Customer service (whether you're a school principal, a call center or a consultant) can't begin until the person you're working with believes that you're going to help them put out the fire on their head.
Basic principles worth considering (are you listening, Verizon?)
The first promises kept are hints that you will keep future promises.Putting people on endless hold, bad voice trees, live chat that isn't actually live, an uncomfortable chair in the waiting room, a nasty receptionist, unclear directions to your office, bad line management… all of these things escalate stress and decrease trust.
Don't underestimate the power of a good sign, a take-a-number deli machine and a thoughtful welcome.
Don't deny that the customer/patient/student has a problem.If they think they have a problem, they have a problem. It might be that your job is to help them see (over time) that the thing that's bothering them isn't actually a problem, but denying the problem doesn't de-escalate it.
Leave the legal arguments at home.It's entirely possible that your terms of service or fine print or HIPAA or lawyers have come up with some sort of clause that prevents you from solving the problem the way the customer wants it solved. You can't do anything about that. But bringing it up now, in this moment of escalation, merely makes the problem worse.
The goal is to open doors, not close them. To gain engagement and productive interaction, not to have the customer become enraged and walk away.
Empathize with their frustration.It's entirely possible that you think the patient's problem is ridiculous. That the customer is asking for too much. That you're going to be unable to solve the problem. Understood. But right now, the objective is de-escalation. That's the problem that needs to be solved before the presented problem can be solved. Acknowledging that the person is disappointed, angry or frustrated, and confirming that your goal is to help with that feeling means that you've seen the person in front of you. ""Ouch,"" and ""Oh no,"" are two useful ways to respond to someone sharing their feelings.
One minute later, then, here's what's happened:
Wow. That's a lot to accomplish in sixty seconds.
Do you think the rest of the interaction will go better? Do you think it's likely that the person at the airplane counter, the examining table or on the phone with you is more likely to work with you to a useful conclusion?","January 11, 2018","de-escalation, customer service, empathy"

Getting paid what you deserve,"You never do.
Instead,you get paid what other people think you're worth.
That's an empathic flip that makes it all make sense.
Instead of feeling undervalued or disrespected, you can focus on creating a reputation and a work product that others believe is worth more.
Because people don't make buying decisions based on what's good for you–they act based on what they see, need and believe.
Yes, we frequently sell ourselves too short. We don't ask for compensation commensurate with the value we create. It's a form of hiding. But the most common form of this hiding is not merely lowering the price. No, the mistake we make is in not telling stories that create more value, in not doing the hard work of building something unique and worth seeking out.
This is another way to talk about marketing. And modern marketing is donewiththe people we seek to serve, not at them. It's based on the idea that if the customer knew what you know, and believed what you believe, they'd want to work with you. On the principle that long-term trust is worth far more than any single transaction every could be.

Stuck on what’s next,"When confronted with too many good options, it's easy to get paralyzed. The complaint is that we don't know what to do next, because we're pulled in many good directions–and doing one thing with focus means not doing something else.
This is a common way to get stuck. After all, if you're at this crossroads, where more consideration means more possibility, while more action merely means walking away from a potentially better choice, it's easy to settle for the apparently safe path, which is more study.
No one can blame you for careful consideration. More careful consideration seems to insulate you from the criticism that follows taking action.
But getting stuck helps no one.
Here's an alternative:
Write up a one-pager on each of the five best alternatives you are considering. Use the document to sell each idea as hard as you can, highlighting the benefits for you and those you seek to serve.
Then, hand the proposals to your trusted advisors. They vote (without you in the room) and you commit to doing whatever it is they choose. Not thinking about it, but doing it.
Merely agreeing to this scenario is usually enough incentive to pick on your own and get to work.","January 8, 2018","decision-making, options, action"
Hiding from the mission,"We do this in two ways:
The first is refusing to be clear and precise about what the mission is. Avoiding specifics about what we hope to accomplish and for whom. Being vague about success and (thus about failure).
After all, if no one knows exactly what the mission is, it's hard feel like a failure if it doesn't succeed.
The second is even more insidious. We degrade the urgency of the mission. We become diffuse. We get distracted. Anything to avoid planting a stake and saying, ""I made this.""
It's possible to spend 7 hours and 52 minutes out of an eight-hour day in doing nothing but hiding from the mission. And it's exhausting.","January 7, 2018","mission, avoidance, urgency"
What sort of performance?,"It's not unusual for something to be positioned as the high performance alternative. The car that can go 0 to 60 in three seconds, the corkscrew that's five times faster, the punch press that's incredibly efficient…
The thing is, though, that the high performance vs. low performance debate misses something. High at what?
That corkscrew that's optimized for speed is more expensive, more difficult to operate and requires more maintenance.
That car that goes so fast is also more difficult to drive, harder to park and generally a pain in the neck to live with.
You may find that a low-performance alternative is exactly what you need to actually get your work done. Which is the highest performance you can hope for.","January 6, 2018","performance, efficiency, practicality"
Your theory,"Of course, you have one. We all do. A theory about everything.
You're waiting for 7:20 train into the city. Your theory is that every day, the train comes and brings you to work. Today, the train doesn't come. That's because it's Sunday, and the train doesn't run on the same schedule. Oh. So you've learned something, and now you have a new theory, which is that the train comes at 7:20 on weekdays only. And you'll keep working with that theory, and most of the time, it'll help you get what you want.
And you have a theory that putting a card into the ATM delivers money.
And you have a theory that smiling at a stranger increases the chances that you'll have a good interaction.
And on and on.
Many theories, proposals about what might work in the future.
We can fall into a few traps with our theories about humans:

Why we don’t have nice things,"The creation of worthwhile work is a duet. The creator has to do her part, but so does the customer.
One of the best airport restaurants I’ve ever encountered breaks my firstruleof airport eating. The sushi bar at gate 34 ofNaritaairport is a special place (though I wish they didn’t serve tuna).
The rice is extraordinary. The nori is crisp. The service is efficient but friendly. They have wonderful vegan rolls, flavorful shiso, and yes, it’s hard to believe but true: real wasabi, grated to order. My guess is that the very best sushi restaurant in your town doesn’t serve real wasabi. But I digress.
When I was there a few months ago, I apologized to the entire staff. I apologized to them on behalf of every traveler (many, if not most, from my country) that was dredging this extraordinary product in soy sauce, bathing it from top to bottom in the style created to mask the flavor of generations-worth of mediocre, lazily-created sushi. The Japanese equivalent of putting ketchup on your food in a fine restaurant.
I could only imagine how much it hurt for the caring artisans to watch their creation get wrecked by diners too oblivious to see what had been created for them.
And one day, I’m guessing, a new layer of management will wonder why they even bother. So they’ll cut a few corners and few will notice. The race to the bottom.
Every once in awhile, someone steps up and makes something better. Much better. When it happens, it’s up to us to stand up and notice it. Which means buying it and consuming it with the very same care that it was created with.
Movies, writing, sushi, safety ladders, high-powered magnets, saxophones… it doesn’t matter.

“We don’t do rabbits”,"One thing that's often taught in amateur internet marketing school is the idea of keyword stuffing.
List every possible thing that someone might want you to do on your website, so if they type that in, they'll find you.

I was at the vet a few years ago, and he was busy trying to fix a rabbit. He's a good vet, but how many rabbits does he actually get to treat? I think everyone would have been happier if he had announced that the client should have taken her pet to a rabbit specialist.

Low & Slow (vs. fear),"My sourdough rye bread failed. For the first time since I've been baking from this starter, this weekend's batch didn't work.
I know why.
I rushed it.
I didn't let the dough ferment long enough.
And then I made the oven hotter, in an effort to get the loaves finished so I could leave to meet someone.
That's not how great bread works. It's ready when it's ready, not when you need it to be.
Of course, the analogy is obvious. Much of the work we do as creators, as leaders, as people seeking to make change–it needs to ferment, to create character and tension and impact. And if we rush it, we get nothing worth very much.
There's a flipside.
Sometimes, we mistakenly believe that we're building something that takes time, but what we're actually doing is hiding. We stall and digress and cause distractions, not because the work needs us to, but because we're afraid to ship.
Impatience can be a virtue if it causes us to leap through the fear that holds us back.

“Is the noise in my head bothering you?”,"The monologue that runs in our brain is loud. It's heavy-metal loud compared to the quiet signals we get from the rest of the world.
All day, every day, that noise keeps going. It's the only voice that has seen everything we've seen, believes everything we believe. It's the noise that not only criticizes every action of every other person who disagrees with us, but it criticizes their motives as well. And, if we question it, it criticizes us as well.
Is it any wonder that projection is more powerful than empathy?
When we meet people, we either celebrate when they agree with us or plot to change or ignore them when they don't. There's not a lot of room for, ""they might have a different experience of this moment than I do.""
That noise in our head is selfish, afraid and angry. That noise is self-satisfied, self-important and certain. That noise pushes intimacy away and will do anything it can to degrade those that might challenge us.
But, against all odds,empathy is possible.
It's possible to amplify those too-quiet signals that others send us and to practice imagining, even for a moment, what it might be like to have their noise instead of our noise.

And the publisher scales it. Turns it into a business or a success on some other metric.
Throughout the ages, there have been world-class editors. Sometimes they get the authors they deserve, sometimes not. And there have always been great publishers, turning worthy (and sometimes less than worthy) ideas into successes.
If you’re a maker of change, you might resort to being your own editor and your own publisher. After all, the ideas must be brought forward. If you can, though, see if you can find the editor and the publisher your work is worthy of.","February 19, 2018","changemaker, editor, publisher"
"Building, breaking, fixing","We spend some of our time building things, from scratch. New ideas, new projects, new connections. Things that didn't exist before we arrived.
We spend some of our time breaking things, using them up, discovering the edges.
And we spend some of our time fixing things. Customer support, maintenance, bug fixes… And most of all, answering email and grooming social media. The world needs fixing, it always does.
You've already guessed the questions:
a. where do you personally add the most value?
b. how much of your time are you spending doing that?

[If you want to spend more time in building mode, I hope you'll take a look at the altMBA. It's designed to upgrade and recharge your commitment to building things. Final deadline forapplicationsfor our next session is tomorrow, Monday, the 19th.]
Last week, a small group of our worldwide coaching team got together. It reminded me of how much Kelli, Marie, Alex, Sam, Fraser, Anne, our extraordinary coaches and our thousands of alumni have contributed to evolving the altMBA. Thank you.

Quick or smart?,"Your smartphone makes you quick, not smart.
Every time you pick up your quickphone, you stop inventing and begin transacting instead.
The flow of information and style of interaction rewards your quickness. It helps you make decisions in this moment. Which route to drive? Which restaurant to go to? Which email to respond to?
Transactions are important, no doubt. But when you spend your entire day doing them, what disappears?
We can’t day trade our way to the future we seek.","February 17, 2018","smartphone, quickness, transactions"
“I’m not selling anything”,"Of course you are. You're selling connection or forward motion. You're selling a new way of thinking, a better place to work, a chance to make a difference. Or perhaps you're selling possibility, generosity or sheer hard work.
It might be that the selling you're doing costs time and effort, not money, but if you're trying to make change happen, then you're selling something.
If you're not trying to make things better, why are you here?
So sure, you're selling something.
Perhaps it would be more accurate to say, ""I'm not selling something too aggressively, invading your space, stealing your attention and pushing you to do something that doesn't match your goals.""
That's probably true. At least I hope it is.","February 16, 2018","selling, connection, change"
Looking for seekers (who are looking for you),"""Don't go to the supermarket when you're hungry.""
The reason is obvious–when you're hungry, you're likely to buy things. The risk is that you'll buy something you don't need, because, of course, all that buying isn't actually making you less hungry.
The same thing is true for just about anything we seek to sell. Selling water to a thirsty person, education to someone seeking enlightenment, goals to someone eager to move forward—this is dramatically easier and more satisfying than first having to persuade someone that they should actually care about the difference you're trying to make.
Obvious? I think so.
But most marketers make this mistake on the very first day and keep making it for their entire career.
You might be in love with the change you are trying to make in the world. Best to begin with an audience that's rooting for you to succeed.","February 15, 2018","marketing, audience, selling"

Born to paint?,"More than a hundred billion people have ever lived. Perhaps 1,000 have been widely heralded as artistic geniuses who painted in oils.
And perhaps there were another thousand genius physicists and just one Nobel-Prize winning folksinger.
We sell ourselves short when we argue that there's something magical about creative work, something that can only happen if we're born to do it.
It's not that different from the thesis that there's something in the DNA of Spanish-speaking people that makes them good at soccer. I hope we can agree that people from countries that speak Spanish are more likely to be soccer stars because they grow up surrounded by soccer, with the expectation that they too can be good at it.

The first law of organizational thermodynamics,"Energy is either created or destroyed.
Newton was right aboutphysics, but in organizations and cultures, the opposite is true.
You're either the person who creates energy.
Or you're the one who destroys it.
You might be the one who initiates projects, who asks, ""what if?"" or eagerly says, ""I'll do it."" The person who finds and amplifies and supports the good work of others. The spark.
Or, it's possible you're the passive one, the naysayer, the bystander, the one who manages to eat the donuts at the meeting but not actually add much in the way of energy, kinetic or potential.
You can choose to be the generous one, putting in more than you take out, surprising everyone with a never-ending flow of generosity.
Or, you can find any of one hundred perfectly acceptable explanations/excuses/reasons why you're merely an absorber of it.","February 12, 2018","Organizational Energy, Contribution, Mindset"
What is extraordinary contribution worth?,"I know it's worth a lot to the recipient, but what is it worth to you?
We all know what normal contribution looks like. It's what happens when a qualified person does the job, meets spec and keeps a promise.
But extraordinary contribution is rare. It's when we surprise the system, and perhaps ourselves, by showing up with something unexpected, far beyond the common standard. Extraordinary contribution creates careers. It's a breakthrough in the status quo, a shift in a previously accepted power dynamic.
Extraordinary contribution changes not just the recipient, but the giver as well.
So yes, it's worth quite a bit. The chance to do astagein a professional (and generous) kitchen is priceless. The internship or the summer job where you quite recklessly level up, showing the world and yourself just what you're capable of–that's worth far more than the money you spent going into debt with college for.
The hard part isn't working for free. The hard part is figuring out that this is your chance to do more than you're asked, to resist being unpaid labor for an organization too cheap to pay you properly. Instead, this is a rare moment to leap.","February 11, 2018","extraordinary contribution, value, career growth"

What do you see?,"A better question might be, ""what do youchooseto see?""
If I take four professionals to the Whitney:
The architect sees the building, the sight lines, the way the people and the light flow.
The framer notices the craftsmanship and taste in the way the paintings are framed and hung.
The lighting designer can't help but comment on the new LEDs.
And the art dealer sees the names of each artist and marvels over career arcs.
When you read a blog post, or see a successful project or read about an innovation, what do you see?
Do you see the emotions and the fear and the grit of the people behind it?
Do you see the strategy and high-level analysis that went into it?
Or do you see the execution and technique?
Some people are willingly blind to metaphor, viewing each example as a special case. Others manage to connect the dots and find what they need just about anywhere.
You might not need more exposure to the new. Instead, it might pay to re-see what's already around you.","February 9, 2018","perspective, perception, interpretation"
Reversing Alinsky’s rules,"In Rules for Radicals, Saul Alinsky laid out 13principlesthat can be used in zero-sum game political settings to discourage and defeat enemies.
Alas, this approach is often used bybothsides in just about any issue, and tears away at civil discourse. When you're so sure you're right that you're willing to burn things down, it turns out that everyone is standing in a burning building sooner or later.
What happens if we reverse the rules?
1. Put people to work. It’s even more effective than money.2. Challenge your people to explore, to learn and to get comfortable with uncertainty.3. Find ways to help others on the path find firm footing.4. Help others write rules that allow them to achieve their goals.5. Treat the others the way you’d want to be treated.6. Don’t criticize for fun. Do it when helps educate, even if it’s not entertaining.7. Stick with your tactics long after everyone else is bored with them. Only stop when they stop working.8. It’s okay to let the pressure cease now and then. People will pay attention to you and the change you seek when they are unable to consistently ignore it.9. Don’t make threats. Do or don’t do.10. Build a team with the capacity and the patience to do the work that needs doing.11. If you bring your positive ideas to the fore, again and again, you’ll raise the bar for everyone else.12. Solve your own problems before you spend a lot of time finding problems for the others.13. Celebrate your people, free them to do even more, make it about the cohort and invite everyone along.

The respect of ‘why’,"""Because I said so,"" ends our inquiry, shuts the door and disrespects the questioner, all at the same time.
Explaining what we need and why allows us to engage. It creates a connection of mutual respect.
When a bureaucrat or authority figure refuses to explain 'why', he is showing fear (because he's not sure why) and contempt (because he doesn't have to care).
We'd prefer to engage with a human, every time.

Ignore sunk clowns,"Yes there was supposed to be a clown at your birthday party. No, he didn’t show up. That’s a bummer.
But! But your friends are all here, and the sun is shining and you’ve got cake and a game of pin the tail on the donkey ready to go.
The question is: how long should you mourn the loss of the clown? How much more of your party are you ready to sacrifice?
The same question confronts the pro golfer who three-putted on the third hole.
Or the accountant who forgot an obvious deduction, one that can’t be recovered.
Or the salesperson who missed a key meeting, or the speaker who got let down because the tech crew screwed up her first three slides.
If it doesn’t help, why bathe in it?
When we can see these glitches as clowns, as temporary glitches that are unrelated to the cosmic harmony of the universe or even the next thing that’s going to happen to us, they’re easier to compartmentalize.
That happened.

Empathetic doesn’t mean doormat,"It's essential to find empathy for the people you hope to serve, to teach, to work with. Without it, you can't find the place they're stuck, you can't help them move in the direction they seek to go.
But it's entirely possible that your empathy will lead to a moment where you need to say 'no'.
""I just bought a new car from you, drove it for a thousand miles, but now, I've broken my arm in a fall and I won't be able to drive for a while. Can I please have a full refund?""
Of course, this is a selfish request. Your dealership can't survive if buying a car is a slightly more complicated version of renting one for free.
Yes, you can empathize or even sympathize with this customer's plight. A broken arm is bad enough, but the additional pain of seeing a car you can't drive every day… that's worse.
But empathy doesn't require you to reach into your pocket because the customer has rewritten the terms of the deal and is undermining the business you've built to serve others.
Instead, it means that you can see his pain and that you're completely okay with this person not buying from you again. That through the mist of pain and percocet, it's entirely possible that he doesn't have the reserves to be empathic to you, that he can't see it through your eyes. And you probably can't force him to.
So empathy leads to, ""I hear you, I see you, and if you need to walk away, we'll understand. We hope you'll see it the way we do one day, but right now, I can't solve your problem.""","February 5, 2018","Empathy, Boundaries, Customer Service"
The Super Bowl is for losers,"[But selling projects well isn't. There are five things every project organizer can learn from the stadium builders…]
TheTimesreportsthat the people of Minnesota spent half a billion dollars (more accurately written as $500,000,000.00) to build a stadium and make concessions that led to being able to host the big game today. And, like every other city that has invested heavily in the NFL over the last decade or more, they will certainly lose money, probably a lot of money. More money than we can easily visualize.
So why does it keep happening?
Why, despite volumes of documented evidence, do well-intentioned people spearhead new projects like this? There's a valuable set of lessons here about human behavior:
For me, the biggest takeaway is to realize that in the face of human emotions and energy, a loose-leaf binder from an economist has no chance. If you want to get something done, you can learn a lot from the power of the stadium builders. They often win.
[Update: I heard from some kind readers in MN who shared numbers that show that the state was very careful with their investment, and it might be one of the better long-term stadium bets on record. Well done. If youhaveto do a giant stadium project like this one, it sounds like this is the way to do it…]","February 4, 2018","Super Bowl, stadium investment, project management"
Everyone’s watching (no one is watching),"When you're doing something you'd rather hide, when you're cutting corners, breaking promises or acting like a bully, it's fair to assume that plenty of people are watching.
And when you've got a new project to launch, an act of generosity you want to share or an announcement to make, it's useful to imagine that those very same people are doing something else.
Positive signals are often weak signals. We need to be prepared to offer them with consistency, to keep showing up in the face of apparent apathy. It's not apathy, it's merely people who are too busy and distracted to slow down and hear you enough to appreciate you (at first.)","February 3, 2018","perception, visibility, consistency"
What motivates you to take action?,"School taught us to answer a simple question, “will this be on the test?” If the answer is no, we’ve got no time for it.
Work taught us to fear the boss and the review and our performance ranking. And we are motivated to do the work if we get paid for it, because, after all, that’s why we call it work. Do the least, because you're always going to get asked to do more.
Or we could be motivated to avoid shame, or to take advantage of the sale that’s about to end. Motivated by deadlines, by crises, by the media ""breaking news"" out of the situation room.
Is it any wonder, then, that we end up as short-term, unhappy, profit seekers? And that marketers and others that seek to engage with you build their offerings around your motivation?
Millions of students are in college, many going hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. They are surrounded by huge libraries, high-speed internet access and educated people, and yet the dominant dynamic remains: how little can I do? Will this be on the test?
And the rest of us are in the real world, with the infinite library of humanity at our fingertips, with millions of people to connect with, with an unlimited array of problems worth solving right in front of us.
What if each of us were motivated by curiosity instead? Or generosity? Perhaps we could learn to see possibility instead of risk. What if we took and finished online classes because we could, not because there are assignments, tests and a certificate?
I see this firsthand with the shift students in mycoursesgo through. At first, there's an awkward pause when people realize that there are no tests. Without tests, it seems, it's easier to focus on more pressing urgencies at home or at work. But then, postures begin to change. People realize that a different kind of motivation might lead to a different sort of outcome.
The choice of motivation is a fork in the road. It not only determines what we do and how we do it, but it drives marketers to decide what they make and how they’ll sell it. It changes the way school boards and regents design courses. It changes the story we tell ourselves.
Today's Groundhog day, an oddball holiday built on the premise that winter's a grind, that we want it to be over with, that our motivation is TGIF… The magic of thefilm, though, was realizing that our motivation is actually up to us, and that if we choose, we can change it. If we do, the world might change in response.
We get more of what we respond to.","February 2, 2018","motivation, curiosity, personal growth"
Falling out,"The hard part isn't coming up with a new idea.
The hard part is falling out of love with the old idea.
That's why editing work is so difficult. In order to make the new thing, to make the old thing better, you need to destroy it first.
Situation switching, acting as if, loving the idea enough to sketch it out and then caring enough to stop loving it… that's where the tension often lies.","February 1, 2018","Editing, Ideas, Love"
What is and what might be,"They have much less in common than you might expect.
The key step in creating a better future is insisting that it not be based on the assumptions, grievances and dead ends of the past.
The future won't be perfect. We won't be perfect. But we can be kind. We can listen. We can give opportunity the benefit of the doubt.
The future won't always work. We won't always succeed. But we can be alert and seek out the possible instead of the predicted.
The future won't always be fair. But we can try. We can care. We can choose to connect.
It can be better if we let it.

The Podcast Fellowship (a summer program),"[If you know a full-time student in need of a worthy summer project, please share with them…]
Summer internships are a problem. Too often, you’re working for free, doing very little of value and learning less. Two out of three might be okay, but that’s a lousy combination.
Too often, careers are shaped based on too little input from a busy office. And far too often, privilege and existing relationships play a role in who gets to do something productive.
In real life, after college, you’re less likely than ever to have a real job in a real office. You’re also hoping to be doing a job you actually like, where people aren’t telling you what to do all day. Why train for the worst outcome all summer in a dead-end internship?
Alex DiPalma and I are pleased to invite you to consider an experiment, open to a hand-picked group of students this summer. A virtual program, available wherever there’s a laptop and an internet connection. Alex is a successful podcast producer, who has worked onAkimbo, with Minnesota Public Radio, withCal Fussman, withFood4Thot, among other shows. She knows what’s up.
The idea: You should build a podcast. A thirty-episode series, a podcast that captures insights and experiences in an area you care about.
Are you hoping for a career in urban planning? Make your podcast about that. Over the course of the thirty episodes, you can interview leaders in your field. You can capture your thoughts on the big (and small) issues of the day. You can lead and you can teach.And no one can stop you.
It doesn’t matter how many people listen to it. It doesn’t matter that it doesn’t have a sponsor. It matters that you made it.
By the end of the summer, you’ll have published your work to anyone who cares to subscribe. You’ll have developed assertions, made connections and most of all, shared with generosity. You won’t be a technical wizard, you’ll have something better than that–the confidence that comes from having built and shipped generous work.
The (updated) program itself can be foundright here.
Throughout the program, we’ll be teaching you useful techniques, challenging you to invent new ones, and most of all, connecting you with other students who are going where you’re going. This online mastermind group will take a real commitment, a few hours a day at minimum. But if you put in the time, you’ll earn the body of work you’ll end up creating.
The program costs about $10 a day, because we want people to have skin in the game.","March 30, 2018","Podcast Fellowship, summer program, podcast creation"

When your ideas get stolen,"A few meditations:
Good for you.Isn't it better that your ideas are worth stealing? What would happen if you worked all that time, created that book or that movie or that concept and no one wanted to riff on it, expand it or run with it? Would that be better?
You're not going to run out of ideas.In fact, the more people grab your ideas and make magic with them, the more of a vacuum is sitting in your outbox, which means you will prompted to come up with even more ideas, right?
Ideas that spread win.They enrich our culture, create connection and improve our lives. Isn't that why you created your idea in the first place?

Time to stop hustling and interrupting.
Time to stop spamming and pretending you're welcome.
Time to stop making average stuff for average people but hoping you can charge more than a commodity price.
Time to stop begging people to become your clients, and time to stop feeling badly about charging for your work.
Time to stop looking for shortcuts and time to start insisting on a long, viable path instead.
Time to start contributing.
There are lots of ways to embrace modern marketing, but the there's no doubt that you'll be better off once you do.
Modern marketing is the practice of making something worth talking about, developing empathy for those you seek to serve and being in the market in a way that people would miss you if you were gone.

Secure and respected and engaged and risky,"Some people want their workplace to be like an artist's studio. A lab. A dance with the possible. Engaging. Thrilling. The chance to take flight, to be engaged, to risk defeat and to find a new solution to an important problem.
And some people want a job that's secure, where they are respected by those around them.
The essential lesson: These are not necessarily different people, but they are very different attitudes.
It's a choice, a choice made once a lifetime, or every year, or perhaps day by day…
When you sit with an employee who seeks security and talk to them about ""failing fast,"" and ""understanding the guardrails,"" and ""speaking up,"" it's not likely to resonate.

Don’t split the pot (at least not at this table),"I got kicked out of the only regular poker game I was ever a part of.
The first week I won a few bucks.
The second week, I broke even.
The third week, the betting got serious and there was a lot on the table–maybe as much as $30(!). Realizing that this sort of risk didn't work for me, I turned to the last two people left in a hand and said, ""why don't we split the pot three ways?""
In the long run, that might be a good way to go home flush. In real life, it's a totally sensible way to deal with risk.
But at a poker game?
When you sit down at a poker table, you're acting as if. As if you're gambling. And if you don't want to gamble, don't play. That's what they told me and they were right.
The same thing is true when you go to a brainstorming session, or to therapy or even an Ethiopian restaurant.

You will not be surprised by artificial intelligence,"That's because it's incremental. Every time a computer takes over a job we never imagined a computer can do, it happens so gradually that by the time it's complete, we're not the slightest bit amazed.
We now have computers that can play chess, read x-rays, drive down the highway at 55 miles an hour, understand our voice, scan documents for errors, do all traditional banking chores, correct our spelling, plot a route on foot or by plane, find the cheapest airfares and pick a face out of a crowd.
At any time since 1970, if you went to live on a desert island for a decade, you would have been blown away by what happened when you got back.  Day by day, though, human-only tasks quietly disappear.
After the replacement, computers do some of these jobs better than we ever could, but, as they're evolving, we take each of these perfections and advancements for granted. It's too gradual to be awe-inspiring.
Our job now, isn't to do our job. It's to find new tasks, human tasks, faster than the computer takes the old ones away. Too often, people are displaced and thengive up.
We can still add value, but we need to do it differently, more bravely, and with ever more insight.

How many hops?,"Some things, like your next job, might happen as the direct result of one meeting. Here I am, here's my resume, okay, you're hired.
But most of the time, that's not the way it works.
You meet someone. You do a small project. You write an article. It leads to another meeting. You do a slightly bigger project for someone else. You make a short film. That leads to a speaking gig. Which leads to an consulting contract. And then you get the gig.
How many hops does the ball take before it lands where you're hoping it will?
If you're walking around with a quid pro quo mindset, giving only enough to get what you need right now, and walking away from anyone or anything that isn't the destination—not only are you eliminating all the possible multi-hop options, you're probably not having as much as fun or contributing as much as you could either.","March 23, 2018","networking, opportunities, incremental progress"
Overpinnings when the underpinnings go away,"Years ago, most middle class people had a huge, expensive piece of furniture in their living room. It played music and captured radio broadcasts.
The high-endstereobusiness was the overpinning built on this underpinning. ""If you're already going to the expense and trouble of making music at home, why not spend a bit more time and money and have it sound fantastic?""
Of course, most people have solved their music problem, and they didn't need a piece of furniture to do it. The underpinnings that the industry was built on have disappeared.
The same is true for the typicalbookstore. ""If you're already spending a little bit of time and money reading books to stay informed, why not spend a bit more time and money and be really smart?""
The typical adult isn't relying on books for this sort of information any more, so the upgradeable base is much smaller.
Or consider the fountain pen (overpinning the ballpoint), the fancy vacation house (overpinning the motel replaced by vrbo and airbnb), or the fancy suit (overpinning the cheap suit). It's even true for laser printers and cigarettes.
These luxury categories don't go away as fast as the thing they depended on, because they were never mass items, so it's possible to survive on much less demand. But in order to thrive, the creators of these products need to shift their story, their posture and the value they deliver to their audience.","March 22, 2018","Overpinnings, Underpinnings, Market Shift"
Mobile blindness,"You don't need a peer-reviewed study to know that when people surf the web on their smartphones, they're not going as deep.
We swipe instead of click.
We scan instead of read. Even our personal email…
We get exposure to far more at the surface, but rarely dig in.
As a result, the fine print gets ignored. We go for headlines, not nuance. It's a deluge of gossip and thin promises, not the relatively more immersive experience of the desktop web.
And of course, the web was a surface treatment of a day spent with books and in uninterrupted flow on a single topic.
It's not an accident that blog posts and tweets are getting shorter. We rarely stick around for the long version.
Photokeratitis (snow blindness) happens when there's too much ultraviolet–when the fuel for our eyes comes in too strong and we can't absorb it all. Something similar is happening to each of us, to our entire culture, as a result of the tsunami of noise vying for our attention.

There are three ways a hit happens:
It's rare to invent something that works on all three levels. Black Panther is not like the DaVinci Code which is not like the Grateful Dead.

They have different glasses on and are using a different map as well.
People don't believe what you believe, and they don't know what you know. Some of the gaps:
Authority–because the world works better when things are coherent and predictable and someone is in chargeFreedom–because people free to speak up and find their own path are able to weave a civil society out of chaos
Affiliation–because being in sync and engaged with others makes for a happier lifeConformance–because doing what you’re told is safer and telling people what to do is easier
Inconsistent–Change is fine if it makes things better, even if you want to call me a flip flopperConsistent–Because it’s safer to stand for something and not reconsider it

Belief–because it’s a narrative to quiet the chatter in our headProof–because science works
Change–because things can get better if we let themThe status quo–because change is risky
Civility–because we’re working to keep it all from falling apartConflict–because if you can’t handle it, get out of the way

The big hill,"There's a commuter shortcut near my house.
To make it work, you need to accelerate the SUV up a really big hill, breaking the speed limit by ten or twenty mph. Then roll a stop sign, avoid a few kids walking to school and gun it on the downhill.
All to save three minutes.
Meanwhile, the other commuters arrive at work with their psychic energy saved for the real work. The hard work of confronting the status quo.
The first shortcut is selfish. It wastes resources and engages in risk to help no one but the driver.
The other work, though, is priceless. Those are the hills worth taking.

Where are the movie stars?,"I'm sitting in a crowded lobby in Los Angeles, surrounded by 100 or so people. Not one of them looks like a movie star. No one has perfect hair, a perfect family, a perfect life.

And here, at the gym in Yonkers, I'm not seeing a single person who looks like he could be on the cover of Men's Health.
Role models are fine. But not when they get in the way of embracing our reality. The reality of not enough time, not enough information, not enough resources. The reality of imperfection and vulnerability.

Rubbernecking,"A traffic jam can teach us quite a lot about human nature.
In the US, when there's an accident on the side of the road, traffic in the other direction slows down. People voluntarily slow down and look over at the carnage.
This is nuts.
These very same people would never pay money to go to a movie filled with car wrecks that hurt real people. And yet, they do it from their car. It turns out we're very interested in things that are happening in real time, right next to us.
Not only that, but the jam created by this voluntarily slowdown can last for an hour or more. And yet, when it's your turn, when you get to the front of the line, instead of saying, ""well, I got punished for the bad behavior of the 1,000 people ahead of me, I'm going to fix that and speed up now,"" we say, ""hey, I paid my dues, my turn to look…""
And of course, the nature of variance means that human-controlled cars on the highway have to go much slower when they are closer together. And so the slowdown ripples backwards, because instead of leaving plenty of space so that they can all speed up quickly, we inch together, ensuring that the jam will take even longer.
Every time you think that the human beings you seek to serve are rational, profit-seeking, long-term decision makers, visualize a rubbernecking traffic jam.","March 9, 2018","Rubbernecking, human nature, traffic jams"

Clark Kent’s shoes,"Back when Superman used to change into his outfit in a phone booth, the question was: where does he put Clark's shoes? Because even if he could compress them with his super strength, they'd be ruined.
Organizations that need to adopt different personas often get into trouble.
Consider ConEdison, which is completely failing here in NY during the recent storms (and of course, it's nothing compared to what people in Puerto Rico or other parts of the world have gone through).
On one hand, most of the time, they're invisible. They're a boring bureaucracy, optimized for stable jobs, predictable if not low-cost processes, mediocre customer service and average (or below average) user interface design. They're a monopoly and they act like one.
But then, when things break, they're expected to act like heroes, like people who truly care. They are expected to hustle, to find the edge of the performance curve, to really step up.
Unfortunately, their shoes don't compress very well.
We know it can be done. We see heroic organizations do great work. But ConEd doesn't.
John McAvoy, the CEO, is probably pretty good at steering a boring monopoly. I have no clue. But he hasn't built much in the way of heroic response capability. And every time something breaks, that becomes obvious.
Small businesses sometimes wrestle with the opposite. They get their accounts by acting like heroes, performing miracles on an emergency basis. But when it comes time to regularly do the work, to show up and show up and show up, they don't have the resources or the patience to do so.
The opportunity is to choose. To truly embrace one and buy precisely the right kind of shoes.
The alternative is to invest the resources to have two teams that can do one or the other. And to tolerate the fact that when the other team is working, you're not at maximum efficiency.
Systems are a miracle. Until we try to force a system that's good at one thing to do another.
Then we just ruin our shoes and end up annoying everyone who trusted us.
(PS comic book geeks will recall that Clark's shoes were made out of a special kind of miracle foam that looked just like a boring Florsheim brogue but could be compressed into a really small ball. And of course, there's no such thing available to the general non-superhero management class, sorry).","March 7, 2018","Superman, organization, performance"

The Bannister Method,"Roger Bannister did something that many people had said was impossible.
He ran a mile in less than four minutes.
The thing is, he didn't accomplish this by running a mile as fast as he could.
He did it by setting out to run a mile in one second faster than four minutes.
Bannister analyzed the run, stride by stride. He knew how long each split needed to be. He had colleagues work in a relay, pacing him on each and every section of the mile.
He did something impossible, but he did it by creating a series of possible steps.
It's easy to get hung up on, ""as possible."" As fast, as big, as much, as cheap, as small…

Why is this interesting?,"Interesting non-fiction often falls into one of three categories:
a. It's interesting because it's by or about a celebrity.PeopleMagazine and various autobiographies appeal because they offer an intimate glimpse into someone you were already interested in. This is a lot of the appeal of social networks–famousto the family, telling their story.
b. It's interesting because an unlikely thing actually happened to a real person. Books about climbing Everest, starting a company or surviving drug dependency or a dysfunctional upbringing work because they happened to someone else, and we want to watch or vicariously experience what happened.
c. It's interesting because it's about us, the reader. These are books or blogs that offer a path forward, that talk about part of the human condition that you're currently experiencing, that offer solace or guidance or insight about what's happening and what's next.

Is snacking learning?,"Why does a class last an hour? Why does a TED talk last 18 minutes? Why does an MBA take two years?
Could it be that the default lesson length has something to do with the cost of switching rooms, which makes it inefficient to have really short lessons? Or the high cost of physical space, which makes it expensive to have really long ones… Perhaps length is a function of switching costs and bureaucracy structure…
One side effect of the low switching costs and high availability of choice on the web is that people are discovering things in 600-second bursts.
What would happen if we started to do this on purpose? Learn a math lesson, understand a social history movement, learn something about human nature, five minutes have gone by…
Or what if we chose to dive in really deep, deeper than the real world would ordinarily tolerate. Five hours on a topic that might only get three minutes on a typical curriculum… or a month-long interactiveseminardesigned to teach something that's almost never taught.
I don't think learning is defined by a building or a certificate. It's defined by a posture, a mindset and actions taken.
It's still early days in figuring out the best way to transfer knowledge. The length of a class ought not to be set in stone. (For the very same reason that meetings at work should never last an hour).","March 3, 2018","snacking, learning, class length"
Delighting in sacrifice,"In an instant-on, one-click shopping universe, the idea of sacrifice is pretty alien. When the world might end tomorrow, when you can get what you want now, when debt is easier than ever to go into, why even consider sacrifice?
Because it's the single best way to achieve your goals. Satisfaction now almost always decreases the reserves we have to build an asset for later. Investing in something worth building always requires you to avoid getting what you want today. Sacrifice might mean giving up an expenditure, but it can also be the bold step of having a difficult conversation now instead of later.
Regardless of the goal, sacrifices make it more likely that you'll get there.
The journey toward that worthy goal, though, is a key part of the goal itself. We are never certain we'll reach our goal, one significant reason that so few people persist. But if the journey involves sacrifice, we're paying for that goal, the goal we're never sure to reach, every day.
Hence delight.
The act of sacrifice, of foregoing one thing in our journey toward another one, one more generous, virtuous and useful, is actually a little piece of the satisfaction of the goal itself.
If it comes easy, it's not the same.","March 2, 2018","sacrifice, goals, satisfaction"

If we use social media to attract a crowd, we will, at some level, become a fictional character. Reality shows aren't about reality–they're shows.
Which means that it's tempting to become the sort of trainwreck that people like to watch and jeer and root for.
Personally, and for our brand as well.
Every time DC tries to make Superman more popular, they create drama that isn't inherent in who he is. Brands fall into this trap all the time.
For a long time, people would confirm that they'd ratherwatcha flawed character, but deep down, they'd like to be Superman. Because his humility, kindness and resilient mental health are a perfect match for his unlimited powers.

But of course, when everyone has a keyboard and a camera, it's up for grabs.
Some people get frustrated when others use the word ""enormity"" to mean, ""very very enormous."" That's because they know that enormity means ""unspeakably horrible,"" and they're worried that if enough people use it the wrong way, they'll no longer be able to use it the right way, and a nuanced word will disappear.
Language is plastic, it changes over time. Who knows what 'dap' used to mean, or what it will mean tomorrow? What happens to the serial comma or the other refined elements of punctuation? Language is a reflection of who we are and how we speak and it's foolish to insist that it stay the same as it always was.
Work that alters the canon, that begins outside of it but then is incorporated into it, is how our culture grows.
Facts and history, though, fade away if we let them become plastic.
It probably took Descartes 50 years to reach half a million people with his ideas about philosophy and the mind-body problem. The School of Life, with millions of viewers on its YouTube channel, was able to reach half a million people with itsvideoon the mind body problem in just a year. The issue, as dozens of folks have pointed out, is that the video has nothing at all to do with theactualmind bodyproblem, and simply makes up new stuff.
Descartes isn't here to defend himself, and I'm not sure he should count on me to stand up for him, but it points to a bigger problem: Everyone has the authority to have a media channel, but responsibility is in short supply.
We need new ideas, but if it's not in the canon, it's worth labeling properly–a new idea to consider, not an accurate version of what came before.
If you want to earn trust, it helps to either get it right or to fix it once you've discovered that you've gotten it wrong.
""Your mileage may vary"" is a useful way to think about our experiences, but sometimes we don't want our mileage to vary. Sometimes we want to know what actually happened, how to compute acceleration or decode a cultural artifact. Sometimes we want to know about the work that came before.

On taking a hint,"Hints are free.
You're welcome to take them and use them to do better work.
Often, the real truth is wrapped in a hint, because a direct statement is too difficult, it feels too risky. Unwrapping the hint to find the truth is a life skill.
Sometimes, you might try to take a hint when none was offered. Sometimes, we imagine that people are telling us something that they're not. If you have that experience often, it's totally okay to ask for clarification.
The rest of the time, if someone offers you a hint, take it.
(And if you're working closely with someone, it's probably worth skipping the hints and choosing to communicate with clarity instead).","April 12, 2018","hints, communication, clarity"
What do advertisers want?,"You can't be thoughtful about culture without thinking about media, and you can't think about media without thinking about who's paying for it.
Advertisers (mostly) want mass. They'd like the SuperBowl, the home page of Google, the shortest route to the largest number of people. It's easier that way. It's more fun. It requires less risk.
But of course, it costs too much.
Hence data. Data's a way of getting mass, but just the mass they're hoping for. It's a way of spending less in total (but more per person) in the hope that the yield will go up. It's also the trend, and advertisers love trends.
The march toward data has been going on since the early online days, at least 1999, the dawn of internet advertising, because the internetcan'tbe a mass medium. Too many channels, too much interaction. And as it splinters further but requires ever more money to run, the race for data is on.
In this week'sAkimbo, I talk about being there at the beginning of the surveillance race, as well as the option that advertisers and the public can (surprisingly) agree on: limits. Limits give advertisers the guardrails to go back to what they actually want to do, and they give the rest of us a chance to feel safe in a non-commercialized, non-invasive space.
If we don't push for meaningful legal limits on ad encroachment, hyper-targeting and surveillance, there aren't going to be any. The ratchet will keep turning.","April 11, 2018","Advertisers, Data, Surveillance"
Why even bother to think about strategy?,"There’s confusion between tactics and strategy. It’s easy to get tied up in semantic knots as you work to figure out the distinction. It’s worth it, though, because strategy can save you when tactics fail.
If a tactic fails, you should consider abandoning it.
But that doesn’t mean that there’s something wrong with your strategy. Your strategy is what you keep doing even after you walk away from a tactic.
A real estate broker could decide that her goal is to get more listings.
And her strategy is to achieve that by becoming the most trusted person in town.
There are then 100 tactics she can use to earn that trust. She can coordinate events, sponsor teams, host community meetings in her office, sponsor the local baseball team, be transparent about her earnings, hire countless summer interns at a fair wage, run seminars at the local library, etc. …
It doesn’t matter if one or two or five of the tactics aren’t home runs. They add up.
But if once, just once, she violates someone’s trust and expectations, the entire strategy goes out the window.
Tactics are disposable.
Strategy is for the long haul.","April 10, 2018","strategy, tactics, trust"
Speaking up about what could be better,"Solving interesting problems is the best work we can do.
It's a practice that has built the very best parts of our culture.
Solving interesting problems begins with posing them–which means being willing to speak up about what could be betterbeforewe know how to make it better.
We see these problems, all of us do. But they're easy to ignore if we're hoping for a quick win. Instead, patience and empathy define us as the humans we seek to be.
Too often we get trapped believing we need:
Certainty
Quick answers
A guarantee
If you want those three things, you're missing the path. The search for quick, guaranteed and certain results will almost always undermine the creativity you're after.
Creativity is a step on the way to making things better.
As we've built thealtMBA(more than 2,000 students so far), the need for creativity has become ever more urgent.
The web is littered with easy promises and simple call & response patterns. It's antithetical to creativity. Instead, our social networks have turned us into unpaid factory workers, toiling in a giant system, one that pushes us to feel shame, to be in a hurry, to worry about nothing but the surface.
That's not where creativity comes from and that's not what creativity is for.
Possibility and responsibility are available to anyone who wants them. That could be us, any of us.
Seeing the world as it is, offering people dignity, choosing to make a difference… none of these are fast and easy paths, but we do them anyway.
Will you?
Please consider joining us for thealtMBA. The work matters.","April 9, 2018","Creativity, Problem-solving, Empathy"
But what about the people who don’t care?,"How do we work with someone who doesn't seem to care?
I have a hard time believing that peoplecan'tcare. I think that they often don't see. They don't see what we see, or interpret it differently.  Or if they see, they see something you don't see. But if they saw what you saw, and it was related to how they saw themselves, they'd act differently.
The gap is usually in the difficulty of getting the non-owner to see a path to happiness that comes as a result of acting like an owner. Most people are taught to avoid that feeling. Because it always comes with another feeling–the dread of responsibility.

"Exit, voice and loyalty","We often have a choice: speak up or leave.
In commerce, if we don't like a brand, we leave. The always-present choice to stay or to go drives bosses, marketers and organizations to continually be focused on earning (and re-earning) the attention and patronage of their constituents.
Sometimes, instead of leaving, people speak up.
For most of my life, the biggest separation between government and economics was this distinction.
In many cases, government has generally taken the idea of exit off the table. If you don't like your country, you could consider leaving it, but that's an extraordinarily disruptive act. Not voting may express your apathy or disgust, but you're still a member of the society.
Capitalism ceases to be an efficient choice when those served have no ability to exit. For-profit prisons, for example, or cable monopolies. If you can't exit, you're not really the customer, and you are deprived, as a result, of voice.
In the case of effective government, voice is built in on behalf of those that have no ability to exit. A well-functioning representative democracy opens the door for people to be heard and action to be taken.
Suddenly, it's easier than ever for rich people to exit instead of speak up. They can wire funds (when wealth was held only in real estate, that wasn't an option, you can't take land with you) and they can live an almost post-national existence. As a result, since they're not tied down and often pay little or nothing in taxes, they're less inclined to work hard to make their place better for everyone. The same applies to private school (for the few) compared to public school (for the rest).
Voice matters.
Loyalty, then, could be defined as the emotion that sways us to speak up when we're tempted to walk away instead.
When your loyal customers speak up, how do you respond? When you have a chance to speak up but walk away instead, what does it cost you? What about those groups you used to be part of? I've had the experience several times where, when my voice ceased to be heard, I decided it was easier to walk away instead.
Voice is an expression of loyalty. Voice is not merely criticism, it might be the contribution of someone who has the option to walk away but doesn't.

Effort in the face of near-certain rejection,"Every day, we shoot for unlikely outcomes. We send out our resume, pitch our book, ask for a donation, swipe right on a social network…
There are two ways you can go:
ONE: Realize that the odds are against you, and go for volume. This means that you should spray and pray, putting as little effort into each interaction as possible, giving you the resources to have as many interactions as you can. This is hiring a virtual assistant to spam your contacts, or sending out 200 resumes, or pounding your email list again and again for orders. This is your reaction to an unfair world, in which you deal with the noise by making more noise.
TWO: Invest far more in each interaction than any rational human would advise. Do your homework. Invest more time in creating your offer than you expect the recipient will spend in replying to it. Don't personalize, be personal. Create an imbalance of effort and care. Show up. Don't spam, in any form.
The thing is, people can tell. And they're significantly more likely to give you an interview, make a donation, answer your question or do that other thing you're hoping for if you've signalled that you're actually a caring, focused, generous human.

We can do better than meeting spec,"Well, that’s over.Google AInow sounds indistinguishable from a human. And it’ll only get more nuanced and more flexible.
It can read aloud better than you can.
Which means that anything that’s ever been written can be perfectly read to you. Which means that anything a computer figures out or computes can be delivered to you with audio quality that meets spec.
That’s what AI keeps doing… things we said were impossible.
Most of us shrugged when computers could drill holes or assemble machines with more accuracy and speed than a person can.
And we avoided the topic when we discovered that computers could read x-rays with great skill as well.
But now, it ought to make you shudder to discover that something as basic as speech is now better than the typical human’s. Any speed, fully customized, in clear tones with great pronunciation.
Once it’s done a little, it will quickly become commonplace.
And as we all know, when you do something that’s commonplace, it’s not worth that much.
The goal can’t be quality, not for people anyway. It needs to be humanity. The rough edges of caring, of improv and of connection.
If all you can do is meet spec, better be sure you can do that faster and cheaper than an AI can.

It turns out that showing up is a great way to find new ideas, and I have no plans on stopping.

I used them all up (a warning to creatives),"When I was 12, I brought 100 comic books with me to summer camp. That's a lot of comic books, an essentially infinite number.
So, if someone wanted to borrow one, I said, ""sure.""
Within a week, they were all gone. I was comicless for the rest of the summer.
Well, I didn't think it would happen, in fact, I said it would never happen, but now, in April 2018, after so many blog posts, after 18 books, dozens of projects and a bunch of ebooks and videos and podcasts, I'm now completely out of ideas. Big ideas, small ideas, any ideas. All gone. Used up.
I have none left.
I always believed that creativity was generative, that one led to two, that holding back was selfish and foolish. More connection begets more value begets more creation. A virtuous cycle for the ages.
And yet, here I am, sixteen Aprils in a row on this blog so far, and now, finally, zilch. Empty. Nothing even close to a new idea, a generous insight or a whisper of novelty. Nothing to say that might prompt you to do more important work. I don't even know what to make for dinner tonight.
So, be warned.
Apparently, all each of us get is seven or eight thousand ideas. I wish I'd known in advance, perhaps I would have been more circumspect with them. Hoarded them. Watched them more carefully.

More better math,"Math’s important. It’s elegant. It’s a magical way to deal with abstract concepts on your way to finding out the provable truth. There’s not enough math in the world.
Math isn’t the same as arithmetic. Basic arithmetic is necessary, but everything beyond that is simply easily-graded compliance disguised as busy-work.
A high school principal told me that there’s a high correlation between students who fail to complete algebra and those that drop out of school before graduation. It’s not surprising if you think about it—factoring polynomials is a totally useless activity that only demonstrates that you’re good at school.
What would happen if we introduced variables and intuitive algebra and then immediately switched gears to probabilities (gambling and decision making) and statistics (sports, predictions and understanding the world as it is and it might be.)

Up or out?,"We have a choice, a chance to engage with two different environments.
There's the 'up or out' competitive mindset of the soccer squad. Every game you re-earn your spot on the team, or find yourself on the bench.
And there's the fortress, the sinecure, the satisfying feeling of knowing that we're safe. Or at least that we feel safe.This is my desk, my office and my job.When something interrupts that apparently secure perch, it feels a little bit like dying. Don't touch my stapler.
In the fast-moving world of 'up' is also the promise of possibility, the freedom to innovate, the requirement to be generous in your work.Outisn't nearly as important, it turns out, asforward.
Soccer is a zero-sum, winner/loser finite game. But life, it turns out, is a magical opportunity forup, and forforward.
While the sinecure demands little but compliance.
Here's the key question:Which feeling/experience/state do you look back on fondly? Which one engages you, challenges you, makes you the best version of yourself?
When you tell yourself your story—the story of last week, last month or last year—is it about how boring and secure life has become?
What you learn isn't up to someone else's curriculum or syllabus any more–it's on you, on each of us, to decide what's next, to decide who we will become. We're not in fifth grade, wondering if something is going to be on the test.
It used to be that only 10,000 people a year could learn from a top business school, that executive education cost more than a car, that strategies and insights were closely guarded secrets. Now, they're available to those willing to make the commitment.
That commitment is a choice. It's the choice to become a bigger contributor, to stand a little taller, to make a bigger difference.
Upisn't always what we're going to get. Sometimes, we challenge ourselves and fail. But the alternative, the non-choice of sitting still and hoping we'll be ignored in our little sinecure, isn't much of an alternative at all.
In this moment, this summer, right now, each of us has the chance for a bit more up. The chance to connect, to inspire and even to leap.

Big crew/little crew,"Software projects work better with small teams.
On the other hand, it makes sense to have multiple teams of workers if you're paving a patch of highly trafficked highway.
Three reasons:
Coordination
Learning
Ramp up time
As we learned from theMythical Man Monthmore than fifty years ago, software projects rely on coordination of work. As you add programmers, the work doesn't go faster, it gets slower. Ramp up time is expensive. And if the project involves learning as you go, then big teams waste far more time at the beginning while you're figuring things out.
On the other hand, it doesn't make any sense at all to have a single crew working on a paving project. If you need to close the road for two weeks as they work from one end to the other, you've cost the users of the road a fortune. Ramp up time for trained professionals is trivial, and there's no learning and not much coordination. Better to have five crews working on different sections and open the road after just one or two days.
Often, we default to a small crew because we don't believe we can afford a bigger one. But if the work is worth doing, it might be worth doing more quickly. It's easier than ever to find ways to scale project labor now.
And sometimes, we mistakenly choose to use a big crew, thinking that nine women, working very carefully in coordination, can have a baby in one month. Wishful thinking that ends up in disappointment.

Tonuis another useful lesson. ""Truck ordered, not used."" Of course, when you ordered the truck, you expected to need it, and the fact that you don't isn't a bad thing. Sure, you have to pay for it, but it was asunk cost, not an obligation.

Mass personalization is a trap,"Dear seth ,
Of course I could have sent you a personal letter. A direct 1:1 connection between you and me, thanking you for what you did, or letting you know about my new project, or asking for your attention.
Instead, I'm going to hire someone to hand write the envelope in marker, but of course, I'm too busy to do that myself.
And I'll use the latest in digital handwriting fonts to make you think I actually wrote the note. But I'm not careful or caring enough to actually put good data into the mailmerge, so it'll only take you a second to realize that I faked it.
I know that I'm asking you to spend hours on the favor I'm asking, but no, I couldn't be bothered to spend three minutes to ask you.

The triumph of everyday design,"Luxury goods used to be better. Better than the alternatives.
The best-made clothing, the best saddle, the most reliable luggage. The top of the market was the place people who cared needed to go to buy something that had the highest performance.
Today, though, a Toyota is a better car than a Bentley. More efficient, more reliable. The Vertus phone was a joke, and no one needs a $200 mouse when a $9 one is faster and easier to use.
I spent some time at a high-end hotel on a recent gig. The light switches were complicated and didn't work quite right. The door handle was awkward. The fancy faucets sprayed water on whoever was standing in front of the sink. All expensive, none of it very well-designed.
As materials have gotten cheaper and easier to find, it's design that matters. And the market is demanding better design–which is easy to copy and easy to improve.

The problem with forced rankings,"What's the best college in the US?
What about the best car?
Best stereo speakers? Best pizza?
The answer is always the same: It depends.
People hate that. ""It depends"" puts you on the hook, requires you to have priorities and a point of view.
A forced ranking is freeing. It tells you exactly what to expect, and if things don't work out, well, blame the system. A forced ranking brings status along with it, because, apparently, if you care enough or are rich enough to have the best, then you must be the best.
When we compress 100 variables into just one linear measure, we add enormous amounts of editorial tweaking and lose a ton of nuance. If you want to study aeronautical engineering, Harvard isn't going to be a good choice. If you're gluten-free or diabetic, that pizza place might not work out so well for you. And if your definition of a good car includes safety, fuel efficiency or the ability to move your family around, that McLaren isn't going to make you happy.
Forced rankings abandon multiple variables, and they magnify differences that aren't statistically significant. ""Well, there has to be one winner,"" they say, but of course, this isn't true. It's not a linear race, and the very concept of a single winner is forced.
When the US News college list started to get traction, plenty of college presidents spoke out in opposition. Over time, though, they discovered that being well ranked was profitable, and in an industry that touches billions of dollars a year, status leads to money and money leads to more status… Today, many colleges are intentionally gaming the system by changing what they originally stood for simply to move up.
High rankings do more than distort the behavior of those that seek to move up. High rankings attract the sort of people who don't want to discover their own 'best'. Who want to be around others that care about high rankings. Who will run to the next high rank the moment the world changes. And those that are attracted to the winner of a forced ranking change the very tenor of the place they chose. So now, that restaurant that used to be special is merely crowded. Now the company that only keeps its top performers is a horrible place to work.
The biggest problem with a forced ranking is that it's forced.","May 14, 2018","forced rankings, status, nuance"

"Monopoly is the goal, monopoly is the problem","Every public company seeks, at some level, to be a monopoly, an organization with enough market power to dictate pricing, profits and the future of the market.
And monopoly is also a critical failure of capitalism. When monopoly occurs, when the customer no longer has a choice, prices go up, innovation goes down and mostly, consumers have no voice.
A key role of government is to create an environment where monopolies don't happen–and when they do, to intervene and eliminate them.

Putting a value on a story,"Walk through the diamond district in Manhattan and in the course of one block, at least a dozen men will stop you and ask if you're hoping to sell a diamond ring.
A few blocks away, Tiffany will happily sell you a diamond ring.
Buy a $7,000 ring at Tiffany's and walk over to one of these guys and you'll be lucky to get $1,000 for your new ring.
That $6,000 is what you paid for the story.
It's the cost of the box, the lighting, the salespeople, the architecture and most of all, the special feeling.
Do a blind taste test. In one glass, wine from a $10 bottle. In the other, wine from a $200 bottle. The untasted difference between the two is what you paid for the story.
The list goes on and on.

Considering the buyout,"
Is it ever okay to sell the rights to your work?
Milton Glaser was paid about $2,000 in expenses to create the I Love NY logo, one of the iconic marketing images of its decade. He later said, ""I was very happy to do it. I was very happy about the consequences.”
Carolyn Davidson originally made $35 for designing the swoosh that Nike made famous.
Neither was paid enough, certainly.
It's tempting to reject the idea of a creative buyout on principle. After all, you're getting paid a relatively small amount for work that could end up in front of a billion people.
But there's a difference between art and illustration. Between commotion and expression.
Illustration has a client. The client may have an idea or a specific need. And the client is taking on all of the risk, doing all of the promotion. Of course, if it doesn't become a home run, the client isn't entitled to a refund.
The artist, on the other hand, works for the muse. She's responsible for the execution, sure, but also the content, the market fit and the magic of what happens next. The artist is free to wander, and free to own the consequences.
Illustration is a bit like copywriting, corporate music, industrial photography–anything where you're doing your work for commerce, for a client, under direction.
As Milton Glaser has shown, being associated with dramatic success as an illustrator opens the door to even more success. It can fuel your art and create opportunities for higher leverage in your illustration work as well. Illustration can pay some bills at the same time it chips away at your obscurity problem.
When you're willing to do art, do art. Do it wholeheartedly. But the world needs illustrators too, and if it's a useful tool for you, embrace it.","May 9, 2018","buyout, illustration, artist"
Kurtosis is not a disease (but getting it wrong is painful),"The mass producers of the world (from ketchup to school) tried to persuade us that by grouping everyone into a tight bundle of normal, everything would become more efficient and we'd all do better. In stats, this is called leptokurtosis.
The race for leptokurtosis spread like wildfire. It implies control and reliability and compatibility. It insists that people who don't eat normal food are a pain in the neck, that folks who are differently abled and need an accommodation are somehow costing the rest of us something.
You can have any color car you want as long as it's black, and if you can't reach the pedals or read the fine print, well, maybe you shouldn't be driving.
What we've discovered, though, is that a platykurtic distribution is actually more efficient, more powerful and more fair.

Bigger to feel safer,"Creative institutions get bigger so that they can avoid doing things that feel risky.
They may rationalize this as leverage, as creating more impact. But it's a coin with two sides, and the other side is that they do proportionally more things that are reliable and fewer things that feel like they might fail.
In other words, hiring more people makes their useful creative productivity go down.
This is not the way it works in a factory. When Henry Ford hired more people for the assembly line, productivity went up. Things got more efficient. More lines, more plants, more hands led to more productivity. The natural scale of the enterprise was large indeed.
But a creative studio, a marketing team, architects, strategists, programmers, writers, editors, city planners, teachers–the natural scale of the enterprise is smaller than you think.
This is a new law of organizations, and it's not well understood.
We hire more people to make itfeelsafer. To paper over the cracks, to please more people, to increase stability.

It's a race to go viral, to go low, to make a bunch of noise. The quick hit, the shortcut, the inflammation.
But attention is insufficient.
Enrollment means that your audience wants to go where you're going.
Trust earns you the benefit of the doubt.
And permission means you don't have to begin from scratch every time. You've earned some attention. The privilege of delivering anticipated, personal and relevant messages over time.","May 3, 2018","Media, Attention, Trust"

GDPR and the marketer’s dilemma,"On the twentieth anniversary ofPermission Marketing, the EU has decided to write the basic principles of thatbookinto law.
There are two ways to look at this.
Talk to people who want to be talked to.
Market to people who want to be marketed to.
Because anticipated, personal and relevant messages will always outperform spam.
And spam is in the eye of the recipient.
In two simple words: Ask First.
There's a parallel here in environmental regulation. A hundred years ago, when governments first started paying attention to the effluent and poisons that corporations were dumping on their communities, some companies decided to stay where they were, to keep lobbying for 'relief' and to spend a lot of time and money fighting the change. Others decided to race to the top, intentionally becoming more efficient. It turns out that being clean pays for itself. The efficient path has proven, again and again, to be the smart one.
The EU is responding to consumers who feel ripped off. They're tired of having their data stripmined and their attention stolen. (Here's an episode of mypodcastI did on this issue).

The shortcut crowd,"There is no market. There are markets.
And markets have segments. There are people who enjoy buying expensive wine. There are people who will save up their money to have a big wedding. There are people who pay to have a personal trainer…
And within segments, there are careful consumers, traditional consumers, consumers who seek out the cutting edge. There are bargain hunters, luxury snobs and people who measure the way Consumer Reports does.
Often overlooked, though, is the fact that in many markets, particularly involving personal finance, small business and relationships, there are people who are obsessed with the shortcut.
They want something that’s too good to be true.
They respond to big promises that offer magical, nearly instant results.
They want a squeeze page, a tripwire offer, a hard sell.
They respond to these messages because they’re a signal that a shortcut is on offer.
My grandmother, who never exercised a day in her life, bought an exercise machine from a late night TV commercial. When it sat gathering dust, she explained that she thought it would do the exercise for her, and was disappointed that it didn’t magically make her fit for $99.
Or consider the victims of ‘plastic surgeons to the stars’ who pay for radical surgery only to discover that it doesn’t change their social life.
Or the hardworking people who fork over money for a get rich internet ICO, based on technology that they (and the promoter) don’t understand.
There are complicated reasons for wanting this sort of engagement. It might be that the promise and the pressure of these pitches create endorphins that are pleasing. And it might be that deep down, this market segment knows that things that are too good to be true can’t possibly work, and that’s fine with them, because they don’t actually want to change–they simply want to be able to tell themselves that they tried. That the organization they paid their money to failed, of course it wasn’ttheirfailure.

But there’s no data to support this. Sure, some people succeeddespitebeing jerks, not because of it.
For every person who has a reputation as a bully, a deal breaker, an intimidator—someone who fights for every scrap—there are many people who succeeded by weaving together disparate communities, by keeping their word, by quietly creating value.
Both roads can work. The presence of jerks at the top confirms this, and so does the predominance of good folks.

“Are you in a hurry?”,"That’s what the sign at the airport cafe said.
It’s clearly a state of mind. Everyone at the airport is in one of two states: in a hurry, or killing time. The absolute number isn’t relevant–it doesn’t matter how many minutes until the flight that they’re expecting to catch. What matters is their state.
The same thing is true for someone on a commute, or a creative person at work.
You’re either in a hurry (with all the negative and positive that this state entails) or you’re not.
At the airport, people in a hurry are stressed, distracted and no more likely to make their flight.
At work, on the other hand, people in a hurry avoid getting sidetracked and (sometimes) are more likely to leap.

The trap of insightful selection,"“Which one do you want?”
There were 100 quarts of strawberries at the farmer’s market yesterday. In answer to the farmer’s question, the person ahead of me in line spent a full minute looking them all over before picking one.
The thing is: 90% of the strawberries in a quart are hidden from view. They’re beneath the top layer. There’s no strategy to tell which quart is better than the other, unless you (erroneously) believe that the top layer is an accurate indicator of what lies below.
The analogy wasn’t lost on me: We do this all the time. We do it with job interviews, with dating sites, with decisions about who to trust with an investment or even to drive our Lyft.
The other thing is: We get satisfaction out of picking, even if we know that our data is suspect and evidence is limited. We like the feeling of power and control, even though we have very little.
If all you’re seeing is the top layer, you’ve learned nothing. Maybe less than nothing. Con men are particularly good at seeming trustworthy, and the outfit worn to a job interview tells you nothing about someone’s dedication, work ethic or honesty.

The danger of “not good enough”,"That’s how we choose who to work with.
We want someone who’s good at their job. And the ones we pass up are usually labeled as, “not good enough.” And we label ourselves as well. “I’d like to do that sort of work, but I’m not good enough.”
This is obviously a trap.
In almost every line of work, the truthful sentence is, “not good enoughyet.”
Of course, at least once you wrote a great line of code or crafted a good headline. At least once you made a good diagnosis or calmed a patient. At least once you did something extraordinary. So it’s not that youcan’tdo it.

In defense of handshakes,"It seems to be getting more difficult to trust that someone is going to do what they say they said they were going to do.

“So, sue me.”
When local newspapers disappear and can’t keep aclose watchon the government, it turns out that costs go up. When people need a lawyer to make an agreement and a lawyer to enforce an agreement, costs go up. When it’s not clear whether or not it’s worth the emotional and organizational risk to engage with someone, engagement doesn’t happen and costs go up.
Handshakes matter. They make our transactions more efficient and we all benefit.
But handshakes matter even more as part of our internal narrative. When you see yourself as a weasel, or as a bully, or as someone who is entitled to win at all costs, you’re poisoning your ability to be a generous creative. When you tell yourself a story of insufficiency, that you’re the sort of person who can’t possibly find the emotional or financial resources to keep your word, you make everything smaller. And when you’re always looking over your shoulder at who might be catching up to your most recent shortcut, you’re spending less time looking forward.
The bullying/shortcutting/legalistic approach to destroying the honor and trust of a handshake can lead to a downward ratchet. “Well, if they’re going to be like that, so will I…” The alternative is to reserve your best work and your best ideas and your best partnerships for people and organizations that work the way you’d like to work.

Learning from the factory/dealer divide,"Car factories are a bit of a miracle. They make a complex, expensive device, and they do it close to perfectly. People love their cars, and regularly buy new ones long before they need to. It’s a largely solved engineering problem.
On the other hand, car dealerships are a disaster. No one likes them. They’re scammy, stressful and unpredictable.
The difference comes down to management vs. leadership.
Car factories are measured and managed. For a hundred years, stopwatches and spreadsheets have turned the process of making a car into a predictable, improvable system. Management is an act of authority and compliance, and in the controlled setting of a factory, it works.
Car dealers might try to measure the easy metrics of output (how many sold) but they’ve consistently failed at managing the improvised human interactions that car salespeople engage in. It turns out that the few great car dealers are great because of leadership, not management. Leadership is engaged with voluntarily, an enrolled engagement around meaning and manners, not process and motion.
Most of us don’t work in a factory. Most of us aren’t trying to solve an engineering problem. On our best days, we are leaders, or we are led by humans worthy of our best selves.
Leadership is difficult work, as far from a solvable engineering problem as we’ll encounter. It’s easier, though, if we realize that that’s what we’re doing.
When you run your dealership like a factory, you’re not going to succeed, nor are you going to please your staff. This is what creates senseless and humanity-starved bureaucracies.

On paying for software,"The business of software is a bit of a miracle. Properly designed, software isn’t more expensive to create when more people use it. In fact, when network effects are involved, it’s actually more efficient when more people use it.
That’s one of the reasons that people hesitate to pay for software. There isn’t a feeling of scarcity, that the store will run out if it’s free…
But of course, this overlooks the two-and-a-half essential missing factors:
I like paying for my software when I’m buying it from a company that’s responsive, fast and focused. I like being the customer (as opposed to a social network, where I’m the product). I spend most of my day working with tools that weren’t even in science fiction novels twenty-five years ago, and the money I spend on software is a bargain–doing this work without it is impossible.
To name a few, I’m glad to use and pay for:Overcast,Feedblitz,Discourse,Zapier,Dropbox,Roon,WavePad,Bench,Nisus,Zoom,Slack,SuperDuper,Mailchimp,Hover,TypeExpander,Tidal, and many others. IwishI could pay for and get great support and development for Keynote. And I’m sorry I ever encountered the one or two rare exceptions in an industry that generally does amazing work with care and responsibility.
In my experience, the great software companies are run by singleminded people who bend the physics of design to their will, creating powerful leverage for those that they serve. They are craftspeople, impatient with the status quo and eager to make things better.
In many ways, software development has plateaued, and part of the reason is that people hesitate to pay for software worth paying for. I’m looking forward to the next golden age of tools that open new doors for creators and organizations.

What you do when you don't have the ball doesn't have much impact on how fast the ball moves around. But during the moments when the ball is yours, every second you spend is a second added to the route.
That route is called the critical path. It's the irreducible schedule, the sum total of all the required steps.

Marketing sauerkraut,"The story goes that James Cook brought fermented german cabbage with him on a long voyage, an innovative way to combat scurvy.
He knew that getting his sailors to eat this strange and stinky food was going to be difficult, particularly since scurvy is a long-term problem, not something you want to try to solve after you get it.
His answer was based on recognizing the power of status roles and is widely applicable:

Rethinking graduation,"It’s that time of year again… If you hear “Pomp & Circumstance” playing, you know you’re in the right place, and you also know you’re about to witness a pre-electrification (never mind pre-digital) event.
Who’s it for?What’s it for?
I fear that tradition has gotten in the way of design thinking.
When we ask those two questions, great opportunities arrive.
A prime audience for graduation is the graduates. And what do they want? A moment in the spotlight. Official recognition. Digital media to prove it. Speed. Humor. Connection.
At the same time, expanding the amount of time spent parading each student on the stage for a photo and a handshake undermines most of that, and it alienates or numbs everyone else.
Consider: we have screens now. Our graduates believe in speed, screens and being seen.
I’d do the following things, simultaneously:
1. Instead of one team of two doing the handshake and photo dance, have three teams. I don’t think a student cares if it’s a dean or an associate dean (or even a department chair) who shakes their hand. With three processions at a time instead of one, we go from six people a minute to 20. That means, even if you change nothing else, you’ve cut the time by two-thirds.
Reading the names more quickly is easy if you have three people doing the reading instead of one. Read them with care, and respect, and honor them, but that’s no reason to dillydally.
2. You could add extra cameras and have all the photos instantly posted to Flickr or Instagram. This means that the pictures would be shared immediately and with more power.
3. But the real win is in using the iMax video displays. In the month before graduation, each student comes to an office at the school (you can have multiple offices that do this) and records themselves saying their name. Now, we have a video of their face, with their name in bold type below, saying their name with pride. Edited tightly, this would permit a fun, energetic video with each student in it. You could cut in, every few minutes, some singing groups, a on-campus charity event, etc. While the videos are rolling, when a student’s name comes up, she marches across the stage.
Tension.Excitement.Speed.
And it would look great.
Produced.
Energetic.
I think the students would take even more pride in that sort of celebration. We would eliminate almost all the last minute worries (if someone doesn’t march when their picture is up top, that’s okay).

Misunderstanding the free market,"Ice skating requires two things: smooth ice and gravity. Without a reliable foundation, you can't move forward. And without the constraints and boundaries put on us by gravity, you can't move at all.
The free market, the holy grail of some capitalists, is similar.

You need clean air and water, a civilsociety, an educated workforce, a confident and trusting market and more. The very taxes that some whine about are the gravity that makes the system work.

As we apply pressure to an organization, the same thing happens. At first, people engage with change as an opportunity, doing their best work in the face of small shifts. But once fear sets in, so does cavitation. The cavitation, the bubbling, the uncertainty, the expansion and collapse of bubbles of doubt and disagreement—this becomes the primary problem, more than the fear that originally caused the issue.
The challenge is to avoid this before it happens. To insert pressure relief valves, smooth out the bends, and give the energy a place to go.

Walking away from fast twitch,"Sports gurus are happy to talk about the difference between fast and slow twitchmuscles. And it resonates with us, because we fully understand the ping-pong reflexes that are so often celebrated and often fun to do as well.

But if we spend all of our time twitching, we’ll never do the difficult work of the non-urgent. Important work requires a daily commitment, one that isn’t sidelined by every emergency, because there’s always an emergency, isn’t there?","July 27, 2018","fast twitch, urgency, important work"
Everything is an experiment,"If we’re seeking to make change, to make a contribution, the outcome is part of the work. If the outcome repeatedly doesn’t measure up, we should change what we’re doing.
And evidence is everywhere. More proof, more data, more insight about how it worked…
The thing is, much of the time, we willingly ignore the evidence. When we’re theconsumersof the change, we insist on evidence-based treatment. We want doctors and software and teachers that do something that works. We want to get better, we want the computer to not crash, and we want to learn things effectively and quickly…
But often, as practitioners, we ignore the evidence in favor of what feels ‘right’, or because of our attachment to a narrative or what we’ve done before. We stand on principle, not results.
So, before presenting the evidence, before assuming that people will change their work in response to the data, we need enrollment. We have to ask for a commitment. “If the evidence shows that there’s a better way to do this, are you open to changing?”
It takes guts to answer this honestly. It takes guts to say, “no matter what the evidence says, no matter how effective or ineffective this is shown to be, I’m going to stand on principle or status or tradition or belief…”

Business/busyness,"Our time is worth something. Too often, though, we’re guilty of spending it foolishly or out of habit, or without intention… despite our lousy track record, though, itispossible to spend it wisely, just as we try to spend or invest anything valuable.
We wouldn’t buy medicine that we knew didn’t work, or invest in ads that never ran. It seems, though, that time doesn’t have to meet the same bar.
If you had a factory job, it wasn’t your job to worry about productivity. Somebody else was in charge. You did what you were told, all day, every day.
Now, more than ever, you’re likely to be running a team, managing a project or deciding on your own agenda as a free agent. Time is just about all you’ve got to spend.
And yet, we hardly talk about productivity.
Productivity is the amount of useful output created for every hour of work we do.
You can measure that output in money if you want to (it makes the math easier) but in fact, it’s everything from lives changed to knowledge shared. What matters is the answer to a simple question:did I spend my day producing enough benefit for all the time invested?
A teacher has a class for 160 days—an hour a day … How to spend that time, how to spend today, how to spend the next five minutes? What’s the most productive choice?
Henry Ford and the other productivity pioneers of the industrial revolution understood this to their bones. He designed the Model T to be efficient to build. As a result, each of his workers produced far more value per day than they could working at a competitor down the street on a car that wasn’t as thoughtfully engineered.
Since his workers were more productive, he could charge less for the car. Since they were more productive, he could pay them more and thus get better workers. And since they were more productive, he could invest in advertising and brand building. The end result is that the car industry went from 2,300 companies (!) to a dozen or so.
It’s worth pausing there for a second. The competitors didn’t have workers who tried less, or who took more breaks or who were weaker, less skilled or lazy. The other companies lost because Ford focused on productivity in a way that they didn’t.
The internet has opened the door for more people to organize and plan their day than ever before. And we’re bad at it.
Because we associate busyness with business with productivity.
Here are some useful ways to think about it:
1. The best way to improve productivity is to measure it. That means identifying the inputs (how much is your time worth? Is there anyone beside you who is working for free, trading favors, burning all the candles?) and identifying the outputs (what’s the worthy final output of all your effort?)
Hint: likes and friends are not an output. Social media might offer metrics that tell you if you’re moving toward what you hope to produce, but don’t confuse the map with the territory. As soon as you try to make a temporary metric go up at the expense of the real goal, you’re on your way to mere busyness.
2. Once you know what you seek to produce (not an easy task), add up all the time you spent to create it. That’s your current productivity. So, for example, if you’re a musician and you have to work 60 hours on the side to organize, prepare for and run a gig that makes you $600 in revenue, your productivity is $10 of value created per hour. Given that your time is finite, the objective is to compare time spent on that project with time spent on an alternative one. If you need 120 hours to write, mix and launch a track on SoundCloud that earns you $3 in royalties, it’s pretty clear which path created more value (if you’re using money as a metric). Of course, once you decide that being popular on SoundCloud makes those tickets easier to sell, it gets complicated again…
3. Get focused on the challenges and benefits of connection. Imagine two buildings under construction. Both have 25 well-trained, well-paid, hard-working construction workers. One building, though, was built in half the time of the other. What happened? It turns out that construction almost always slows down because people are waiting. Waiting for the waterproofing to get done (while they wait for the specialist) or waiting for parts or waiting for another part of the project. The internet is the home of the connection economy, which means that this challenge is multiplied by 100. What are you waiting for? When you’re waiting, what are you doing to create value?
4. Unlike factories (which are very special cases) our productivity varies wildly. It depends on the project, on the connections, on where we are in the process. If you’re working the same number of hours every day and getting very different amounts of output each day, it is definitely worth figuring out why. What happens to your output if you quit when you’re done, not at 6 pm? What happens if you take on more of the high-output projects and choose to walk away from the low output ones?
5. And finally, embrace the fact that trained people are more productive than untrained ones. That skill matters. That leaning into what you don’t know makes you more productive… that hiring someone who knows what you don’t know makes you more productive as well.
Busy is not your job. Busy doesn’t get you what you seek. Busy isn’t the point. Value creation is.

How to not decide?

"Beyond posturing, placebos or belief","Statistics, well done, are astounding.
They tell us, clearly and completely, what is actually happening.
Ignaz Semmelweissaved a million lives (eventually) with his approach to statistics, despite the fact that he was arguing for a significant change and was not at all well liked.
There are volumes of detailed and verifiedstatisticsaboutcarbonand otheremissions. They’re easy to find if we care to look at them and understand them.
More banal but simpler to visualize, it’s easy to dispense with hype and claims from a running shoe company like Nike, but impossible to dismiss thisextraordinary reportfrom the Times. They addressed the possible self-selection and placebo effects and still came up with a massive performance shift in an industry where I thought it was impossible to deliver a massive performance shift.

Yes, it’s easy to lie with statistics, but quite gratifying and insightful to tell the truth with them.

Avoiding the GIGO trap,"“Garbage in, garbage out.”
It has a nice ring to it. And engineers have long embraced it as a mantra. If you don’t put the right stuff in, don’t expect to get good results.
And so, when we banned leaded gasoline, the car industry complained that they’d never be able to make cars run well again.
And when HP started making printers for consumers, they were eager to point out that you needed to use special paper, and definitely not labels.
And if you’re using the command line on a computer, well, don’t spell anything wrong or whatever happens is your fault.
And if you’re a patient, be sure to take the precise amount of medicine, on time, and follow all the doctor’s instructions.
The thing is, “garbage in, garbage out” is lazy.
It’s lazy because it puts all the onus on the user or the environment. It lets the device off the hook, and puts the focus on the system, which, the device creator points out, is out of his control.
It’s one thing to make a sports car that runs beautifully on smooth roads, perfect tires and premium gas, but it’s a triumph of engineering to make one that runs beautifully all the time.
It’s one thing to organize the DMV so it works well when every person reads all the instructions, fills out the forms perfectly and patiently waits their turn, but it’s a generous act of customer service and organization when the system is resilient enough to work with actual human beings.
The extraordinary teacher adds value to every student, no matter what their home is like. She sees possibility and refuses to settle or blame the inputs. Isn’t that the way we’d like every professional to see the world?

Batting average is a trap,"Baseball is not an accurate representation of life.
In baseball, batting average matters because the outcome of the game is directly related to the percentage of times each batter gets on base.

We’re keeping track of the impact you make.
If you’re working on a project that needs just one funder, one publisher, one partner, it doesn’t matter how many other people didn’t like your idea.
And there’s no extra credit (zero) for getting a ‘yes’ from the first person you ask.
Of course, it’s foolish to spam the world, to make yourself a glutton for “no”, to hustle and hassle and learn nothing from all the feedback you’ve gotten. Sooner or later, you’ll use up your welcome and run out of at bats.
But that’s an extreme, and it’s probably not your challenge.
The challenge is to find the resolve to bring your work to someone who will benefit from it. To learn from what doesn’t work and then to do the work again.

‘Fountain’ matters now more than ever,"A hundred years ago,Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, the original punk artist, and also a Baroness, created a work of art that caused a sensation.
Her friend (put that in air quotes, please) Marcel Duchamp came to her rescue when the work was originally rejected by the art show she submitted it to. He got it photographed and the world of visual art changed forever.
Over the ensuing years, Duchamp took ever more credit for the piece. It’s generallyconsideredone of the most influential pieces of art of the 20th century, but until recently, the Baroness has been uncredited.
When Fountain first caused a stir, it represented a shift in art, from handmade to machine-made, from pre-photography to post. In some ways, it was the end of fine art as a craft.
I’ve been talking about Fountain in speeches for years. The combination of commonplace with daring made it a perfect example of what it means to leap. The statement was clear: The first person to install a urinal in a museum was an artist. The second was a plumber.
Fountain represents something more than that now. It also speaks to us about access, about credit and about status.

And Duchamp? Wrestling with his long hiatus from art (he played chess for decades instead), we can imagine that he was struggling to claim something that mattered, but of course, he wasn’t simply claiming, he was taking. Stealing the magic from someone else.
He lost his nerve, not his talent. Expectations cut both ways.

A catastrophe journal,"Worth a try if you think it might help the way you talk to yourself (which is worse, certainly, than the way anyone else talks to you).
Every time you’re sure you’ve blown it, completely blown it, that you’re certain you’re going to get disbarred, fired, demoted—becoming friendless, homeless and futureless—write it down in your Catastrophe Journal.
A simple blank book, always use the same one.
Just a few sentences, that’s all you need. Write down:
Do this every time a catastrophe occurs.
What you’ll find, pretty certainly, is that two things happen:

Shameless vs. shameful,"There aren’t many fundamental human emotions, and shame is certainly one of them.
Shame is usually caused by a collision between our behavior and our culture. Society uses shame to enforce norms and set standards. When you’re alone in the forest, there’s not a lot of shame.
Too often, marketers, politicians and others with money and power use shame as a cudgel, as a harsh tool to gain control. And it’s usually directed at those least able to thrive in the face of this sort of onslaught.
I’m not sure we’d want to live in a culture where shameful behavior is completely accepted, where sociopaths and selfish short-term people abuse our trust.
At the same time, I think we need to be really clear about the difference between shameful behavior and shaming a person.
Shaming a person is a senseless shortcut. When we say to someone, “you’re never going to amount to anything,” when we act like we want to lock them up and throw away the key, when we conflate the behavior with the human–we’ve hurt everyone. We’ve killed dreams, eliminated possibility and broken any chance for a connection.
The alternative is to be really clear about which behavior crossed the line. To correct that behavior at the very same time we open the door for our fellow citizen to become the sort of person we’d like to engage with.
“How dare you,” is a fine way to establish that people like us don’t do things like that. It is a norm-setting device, a clear indication that certain behaviors aren’t welcome and demand explanation.
As the media available to each of us turns just about every interaction into a worldwide, hyper-competitive conflict, there’s way too much shameless posturing and division. If you want to “win” in social media or politics, you’re no longer trying to be the class clown among twenty high school students, you’re racing to the bottom among a hundred million teenagers or candidates. Multiply that by every endeavor and you can see why there’s so much shameless posturing.
Racing to the top is far preferable. Because the problem with a race to the bottom is you might win. Or come in second, which is even worse.","July 12, 2018","Shame, Behavior, Shaming"
“You’ll pay a lot but you’ll get more than you paid for”,"This has always been a viable position in the marketplace.
For freelancers of every kind, it remains the best one.
The hard part isn’t charging a lot. The hard part is delivering more than the person paid for.
[I just discovered that I riffed on this three months ago. So, in the spirit of making sure we don’t waste a day, here’s some more on this topic…]
There’s a chasm.
On one hand, there are the endless promises and perfection that are promised by the short-term marketer and the aggressive salesperson.
And on the other, there’s the service provider, freelancer, bureaucrat and hard working frontline worker who’s on defense. Who wants the customer to accept theleast, not the most.
One approach is to keep working to survive the chasm. To hype more and apologize later for all that hype.
The other approach, the one I’m hoping you’ll consider, is to charge enough (and then spend that money) to actually keep the big promises you just made.
A race to the top, one that doesn’t happen simply because you announced you’re going to try harder. It happens because you invest in training, staff and materials to make it likely you can actually keep that promise.","July 11, 2018","value, service, investment"
58 years ago,"The world was a twitch away from total nuclear destruction. White bread was a health food. Diabetes and obesity were relatively rare. The newspaper was the way most people heard about the news. We thought things were moving very fast, frighteningly fast. Women rarely worked outside the home, and the Rev. King was a relatively unknown preacher. No one owned a computer. The number of books published every year was quite small, as was the local bookstore. It was almost impossible to spend more than 45 minutes a day keeping up with current events. It was against the law for blacks and whites to marry in Virginia, and for gay couples to marry just about anywhere. Apartheid was mostly unremarked upon in the US. UPS never came to your house. A long-distance phone call was a big deal.
Air conditioning was rare, bottled water hadn’t been invented yet, there were no billionaires, there were three or four channels of TV, movies were only shown in movie theaters, most dangerous diseases would certainly kill you. The air and water were clean, but we were working overtime to make them dirty. Congress wasn’t a version of pro wrestling. Milk came in only one formulation (whole), you probably worked at the same company for a very long time and relatively few people went to college.
And 58 years from now, when, actuarially, most of us will still be around, what will things be like then? Slower? Apparently more stable? Based on skills we have today?
There is no normal. Simply the relentless cycle of change.

A doctor might think her job is to cure diseases.
But in fact, that’s not what gets and keeps patients. The cure is a goal, and it’s important, but it’s not sufficient.
The technical tasks are important, but the work involves more than that.
Doctors who contribute to the academic community, are personable, take a moment to bring emotional labor to their patient, invest in staff and training and put their office in a medical crossroads always do better than doctors who don’t.

Throwing and catching,"Seven years ago, I shared a secret about juggling:
Throwing is more important than catching. If you’re good at throwing, the catching takes care of itself.Emergency response is overrated compared to emergency avoidance.
It’s as true as it ever was, and it’s not just about juggling. In fact, it’s hardly about juggling.
We spend most of our time in catching mode. In dealing with the incoming. Putting out fires. Going to meetings that were called by other people. Reacting to whoever is shouting the loudest.
But if we learn a lesson from jugglers, we realize that the hard part isn’t catching, it’s throwing. Learn to throw, to initiate, to do with care and you’ll need to spend far less time worrying about catching in the first place.

Responsibility Day,"Often mis-characterized as a day of independence.
What actually matters is what you’re going to do with it.
It turns out that if you have the power to make rules, the rules are your responsibility.
If you have the freedom to make choices, the choices are your responsibility.
And if you have the ability to change the culture, to connect with others, to make a ruckus, then yes, what you do with that is your responsibility as well.
Doing nothing is a choice. The thing you didn’t say, the project you didn’t launch, the hand you didn’t lend…

The perils of the discard pile,"If you’ve got a big bowl of pistachios, it’s worth avoiding the costly error of putting the shells back into the serving bowl. The more you do that, the harder it is to actually find a useful pistachio going forward. Better to have a discard pile, which means that the chances you’ll get a good one from the big bowl are 100%.
On the other hand, if you and your team are in the habit of putting ideas, “that will never work,” in a permanent pile of discards, you’re almost certainly missing great opportunities. There’s a difference between, “that didn’t work once, under certain conditions,” and, “that willneverwork.”
Alas, we do the same thing with people. Errors in both directions.
Be careful with your discards.","July 3, 2018","discard pile, opportunities, ideas"
Do-ability,"When we were in fifth grade, our options were severely limited. Not so much now.
In a world without tests and lowered boundaries (i.e. the world adults like you that read this are living in) we have far more degrees of freedom than we realize.
And yet we drift towardconvenience.
Ease and convenience.
Ease, convenience and the freedom from the fear of failure.
We were taught compliance from an early age. The opposite of compliance, we’re told, is failure. In order to amplify compliance, people in authority have instilled in us not just a fear of failure, but worse, a fear of fear.
The reason it’s hard to push ourselves, even when there’s no external downside of doing so, is our fear of fear of failure. That feeling, the feeling of insufficiency and doom, pushes us to seek the comfort of compliance instead.
Wikipedia is the result of a billion edits. Each edit is fairly trivial, and the articles that are the most edited are often on trivial topics, like the more than 5,000 words written aboutDon Draper. It’s easy and safe and fun to write endlessly about a fictional character, while we avoid speaking up about the real things.
At the same time,WikiTribune, a news-focused site built on the same principles, has very little activity. The reason is that it’s not trying to solve a finite problem (adding a paragraph about Don Draper’s affair) but an infinite one, because there is too much news to keep up with. WikiTribune doesn’t need people to fix typos, they’re asking for contributions that are almost certainly going to be challenged. It’s not a do-able problem, so contributing feels like a brush with failure.
We see the same thing happen with books (short ones are easier to sell than long ones, even at the same price) or online education (a short course on calligraphy will do far better than a six-month deep dive into the Stoics.)
It’s essential that we differentiate between things that remind us of fear and those that are actually risky.In our adult world, the most valuable activities are actually inconvenient, fraught with the fear of failure and apparently un-do-able.
Without someone telling us what to do, without a test to prove that we did it, it’s easy to slip into the dumb lane. Dumb, simple, easy, do-able.
But what if we committed to the other path. To find a way to allocate our time to things that might not work?

The thing about propellant,"The paint in the can almost always lasts longer than the aerosol does.

It may be that all you need is to use your propellant more wisely.
[There’s a significant exception to this rule: The rare person who is all propellant. No useful substance, no long-term strategy, simply short-term success based on an abundance of forward motion. If you work with someone like that, try to help them find their way… they’re not going to stop moving, but perhaps you can help them move in the right direction.]","July 1, 2018","propellant, strategy, success"

Happiness is positive cash flow, and the easiest way to get there is to decrease your spending.

It’s tempting but difficult to raise money to pay yourself first… investors want to pay for for your organization’s assets and market presence, not your overhead.

After now,"That’s a recent idea. To imagine the world in twenty, fifty or a hundred years. Later than later. To consider the long-term impact of our actions. History as a concept is recent and thinking about the future is even more recent.
Of course, future generations will be mature enough to think even further ahead. Either that or there won’t be future generations…
Many of the long-term forecasts we’re seeing today aren’t particularly rosy. But at least we’re having them, now, when we still have a chance to do something.
And yet, some of the long-term forecasts are rosier than we can even imagine. The leaps forward in medicine, energy production and AI are transforming our world even as we live in it.
When you’re just a little kid, the idea of thinking about “when I grow up” is mostly an ill-formed fantasy. And of course, a teenager simply lives for today, and perhaps the weekend.
Once you’ve made the choice to be a productive artist, though, someone who seeks to make an impact over time, time is either your friend or your opponent.Time is either something you use as a tool or something that works against you.
Part of the appeal of theFocus journalthat I did with Moo is that it gives you leverage in your work to shift time. It doesn’t automatically give us long-term thinking, but it plants a seed, a seed that helps us realize that we’re on a journey, not simply at an event.
You currently work with people who will be productively working a hundred years from now. In fact, you might be one of those people. When I started posting these notes in 1992, I had no idea I’d be doing it 26 years later. And now I’m hoping that perhaps I’ll be doing it for at least another quarter century.

When you’re in a job interview, a podcast interview, a sales call, a meeting… if we take the approach that this is a test and there’s a right answer, we’re not actually engaging and moving things forward.
Instead, consider using the question as a chance to see more deeply in what this interaction is for, where are you hoping to go? Focus on status roles, the creation and resolution of tension, and most of all, changing minds.

Sprints,"How fast can you go?
This is different from the question we ask ourselves most days at work. Careers are often seen as marathons, designed to last as long as we do.
Sprinting—for an hour, a week or a month—develops a different perspective. It helps us understand our upper limit, establishing a performance setting that reminds us of what’s possible.
Not sprinting randomly, erratically, after shiny objects. Sprinting with intent, in a particular direction…
No one can sprint all the time. By its nature, that’s not sprinting. But sprinting now and then is a useful way to learn that we can make an even bigger difference.

Emergencies cost extra,"If you work in a field where things need to be delivered by date certain, with zero defects, with high consequences if you make a mistake—then you need to charge a premium for exposing yourself to emergencies.
It doesn’t matter what something in a non-emergency situation costs. If someone wants the standard version, let them buy that.
The buyer is offered to pull it off the shelf, see if you like it. If it doesn’t satisfy you, take a different one.
Emergencies (or even the risk of emergencies) cost extra. Yelling at us costs extra. Panic costs extra.
Your entire organization (and your entire day) revolves around preventing the emergency or recovering from it when it occurs.
The reason custom work costs more is no longer a matter of production efficiency. Computers are happy to customize things.
Big companies that serve other big companies spend at least 80% of their overhead on being ready (or dealing with) meetings and emergencies.

And then there’s the kind that inspires us, delights us and brings us something we truly want.
We call them both marketing, but they couldn’t be more different.
The selfish marketer is marketing at us, trading money for attention to sell average (or below average) products to disinterested people. The excuse is that money needs to be made, or that the boss insists, or that we have no choice…
The successful marketer is marketing with us and for us. And she doesn’t need an excuse.

Evanescent boundaries,"If you want to make the Olympic soccer team, join a symphony orchestra or get into medical school, the path is well lit. It's not easy, but the goals are clear and the boundaries are obvious.
Day by day, achievement by achievement, it's a linear race. You know the rules, you can see the competitive landscape and you can train. It's rare that the rules change along the way.
This is irresistible for some people, and if it ends, or they don't make it, they're often lost in the wilderness.
That's because real life doesn't have clear goals and obvious boundaries.
Real life is not organized around an 800 on the SATs, or a FGA average that's the highest in the league.
Instead, real life has changing rules, hidden rules, rules that aren't fair. Real life often doesn't reveal itself to us all at once, the way the rules of baseball are clearly written down.
And so, the first challenge of real life is: find some goals. And the second: figure out some boundaries.
It doesn't pay to get stressed out that these goals and these boundaries aren't the same as everyone else's. It doesn't pay to mourn the loss of the rigid structures that worked in the world you used to be in.

Making it political,"The difference between an actual discussion (where we seek the right answer) and a political one is simple:
In a political discussion, people don’t care about what’s correct or effective or true. Facts aren’t the point.
The honest answer to, “if it could be demonstrated that there’s a more effective or just solution to this problem, would you change your mind?” is, for a political question, “no.”
It doesn’t matter if we’re talking about the the local water tower, the death penalty, labor unions, euthanasia, fair trade, organic food, the EPA or carbon. In political discussions, we don’t have enrollment in the scientific method. We’re not open to effectiveness or proof. We’re engaged in a tribal conflict.
The problem with the fencing in of one topic after another as political is that it gives us less and less space to learn and grow and understand.
Think tanks in DC call themselves non-partisan. But of course, that’s not true, because they’ve already made up their minds. They’re not thinking at all. Merely arguing.","August 19, 2018","Political discussions, Tribal conflict, Non-partisan think tanks"
Transactions without conflict,"It’s only been 140 years since the price tag firstappeared.
Before that, most every transaction was a negotiation. The seller tried to win by charging more, the buyer by paying less.
In many ways, that’s a good thing–treating different people differently, rewarding good customers, adding fluidity to transactions.
But for most buyers, most of the time, the certainty and convenience of transacting without fear, without conflict and without a hassle makes it worth it.
This idea is spreading.
It’s possible to negotiate a substantial contract in a few minutes by email—if both sides care more about forward motion than they care about the last decimal point. Or, to be more honest about it, if they care more about the benefits of the future than they care about the narrative of treating their partner like an opponent.
In an economy based on connection instead of scarcity, the ease of those connections, the reliability built into them, our confidence that the future will match promises made–all of these benefits dwarf the narcissistic narrative of the deal maker who simply seeks to win today, at all costs.

Ringing vs wringing,"Ringing is resonant. A small force causes sympathetic vibrations, and magic happens.
Wringing requires significant effort and can even destroy the object it is applied to.

The problem with coming attractions,"“Knock, knock…”
That’s not a coming attraction. It’s an invitation. An opening. A bit of tension in terms of closure.
A coming attraction, on the other hand, gives it all away. It says, “here’s a bit of what we’ve got, and the rest of it is just like this, but almost as loud and almost as shiny.”
In the short run, coming attractions work faster. They get you a certain kind of audience and they lead to less disappointment.
But the alternative, the hard work of creating tension and then delivering on it–that’s where our best path lies. It requires trust, not proof, and the patience to find an audience that cares enough to work with you to get to where they’d like to go.
If someone insists on experiencing your experience before you give them the experience, it’s really unlikely you’re going to be able to delight them.","August 16, 2018","Coming attractions, tension, audience engagement"
Community rank,"You’re probably familiar with class rank. Among all the kids in this high school, compared to everyone else’s GPA, where do you stand?
And you’ve heard about sports rank, #1 in the world at tennis or golf or chess.
But somehow, we don’t bother with community rank.

All other things being equal (simple contribution analysis for pricing),"If you make a product that costs $5 to produce and package, how much should you charge for it?
I don’t know.
But there’s a simple bit of arithmetic you can do to understand sensitivity in pricing.
Should you charge $7 or $9?
Well, if you charge $7, you make $2 a unit.
If you charge $9, you make $4 a unit, or twice as much.
Which means, all other things being equal, you’ll need to selltwiceas many at $7 as you’ll need to sell at $9.
It doesn’t feel that way, but it’s true. 100 sold at $9 is more profitable than 180 sold at $7. And to take it a step further, you’ll need to sell 800 at $5.50 to make as much as you would have made at $9. Eight times as many.
No one knows what your demand curve is going to be like, no one is sure what impact your pricing will have on all the other items you sell.
But be honest with yourself about contribution.
Price is a story, it’s a story we tell ourselves and others about what we have to offer. But price is also the path to being able to stay in business.

But the culture he’s surrounded with will view anything else as a failure, and so he’ll go into debt and contort himself to get the label, wasting years of his life, tons of money and most of all, his spirit.
The second Harvard problem isnotbelieving that you deserve it. This is the young woman I met a year ago who had a fantastic work ethic and excellent grades but came from a community where the local community college was seen as a stretch, and she didn’t believe she could or should abandon those around her.
Here’s a simple clue that you might have a Harvard problem: If the label you’re seeking comes instantly to mind, or is prompted by those around you, it may be that we haven’t thought hard enough about which label we want.
The famous outcome isn’t often the right one, and often, neither is the common outcome. Being clear about where we’re going and why is a useful place to start.","August 12, 2018","Harvard problems, self-worth, societal expectations"
Difficult decisions,"These are the decisions that are forced on us, the ones that feel unfair, the ones where there are no seemingly good outcomes.
How to proceed?","August 11, 2018","Difficult decisions, unfair choices, uncertain outcomes"
Alcohol vs. cannabis marketing,"[There’s a lesson here for all marketers—legacy brands have clouded our understanding of what marketing can do today…]
US prohibition ended in 1933. After that, there was a gold rush that led to the creation of dozens of billion dollar brands.
80 years later, the prohibition against pot is ending in various places throughout North America and then, probably, worldwide.
The question some professional marketers are asking is: Will there be worldwide profitable brands for pot that are similar to Bacardi, Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff for alcohol?
Both industries are regulated. Both have products that are sold in specialty stores. Both use non-proprietary manufacturing techniques.
Here’s the big difference:
When alcohol marketing became legal, it coincided with the glory days of magazines, radio and then TV.The mass marketing phenomenon happened at exactly the same time as these brands were being rolled out—and along with cigarettes, alcohol brands were major advertisers, particularly in magazines (hard liquor) and TV (beer). The ads supported the media in a fundamental way (and vice versa–Rick’s Cafe anyone?).
But when cannabis marketing arrives, it’s the internet that’s dominant. Andthe internet isn’t a mass medium.
It seems like one. It’s used by billions of people.
But it’s a micro medium. A direct marketing medium. There are 3 billion people online, but they’re busy looking at 3,000,000 web pages (that’s only a thousand a page).
The other difference is that there’s a thousand-year tradition of the pub and the bar. And those facilities offer status games, word of mouth and significant margins that created another marketing engine for alcohol that won’t exist for cannabis.
Sure, it’s possible that the huge demand and profit margins will fund a winner-take-all advertising movement for pot. But it’s more likely to be more like local espresso or high-end chocolate or whisky (word of mouth) and less like vodka.","August 10, 2018","Alcohol marketing, Cannabis marketing, Legacy brands"
Price and satisfaction,"You don’t need to read many reviews to realize that the correlation between price and satisfaction isn’t what you might have guessed.
It’s super rare for someone to write, “5 stars. The product wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t exactly what I needed, but it was really cheap, so, good job!”
In fact, things that are free (streaming music or movies, blog posts, speeches, etc.) almost never get bonus happiness because they had the lowest possible price.
And almost as rare is the review that says, “This is terrific, it was magical and solved all my problems, but I’m only giving it three stars because it had a high price.”
If you want to create satisfaction, the two elements are:
Make useful promises
Keep them
Price is unrelated, except for one thing: Charge enough that you can afford to actually keep your promise. The thrill of a low price disappears quickly, but the pain of a broken promise lasts a very long time.","August 9, 2018","Price, Satisfaction, Promises"
“Summer’s almost over”,"When I was a kid, my mom would start saying that in mid-July.
I think she meant well. Summer is a great time to stand back, to chill out, to spend an entire day or a week producing little or nothing and simply breathe.
But she was reminding us that regardless of our internal clock, the real world keeps moving forward, and that maybe this little window of time, one that we’ll never see again, could be a great time to make a contribution, find a connection and explore what might be possible. The ability to create is a rare privilege, and it’s not to be ignored.
If you can make a ruckus, make a ruckus.

Here at HQ, Kelli and Marie, Sam and our coaches are finishing up two concurrent sessions of the altMBA today. The fifth session of The Marketing Seminar just passed its commencement ceremony, and Alex Peck and I sent the final surprises to the printer for a new book. Because summer’s almost over.
Mark your calendars:

A new seminar,The Bootstrapper’s Workshop, begins on September 5. You can find the early details on our site.

Reality-based reality,"It’s ever easier to weave our own reality, to find a bubble and to reinforce what we believe with what we hear. We can invent our own rules, create our own theories, fabricate our own ‘facts’.
It turns out, though, that when your reality is based on actual reality, it’s a lot more stable and resilient, because you don’t have to be so vigilant about what you’re going to filter out.","August 7, 2018","reality, perception, stability"
Worth paying for,"When you bring a product or service to the free market, the market decides what it’s worth. If you don’t want to be treated like a commodity (a race to the bottom), there are two paths:
Through scarcity:This is worth extra because there’s not a lot of it or we’re the only one who’s got it.
Through connection:This is worth extra because everyone else is already using it.
A little or a lot.
Few substitutes, either because it’s hard to get or because you’ve got all the good folks already.
We pay extra for something because it’s the only one its kind, because we’re quite thirsty and there’s nowhere else to stop, because we think it will go up in value, because it’s our best option from a limited selection. Right here, right now, you’re the best option. In other words, scarce.
Or…
Because we don’t want to be left out/left behind. It’s worth more because it connects us.
Value is not profit. Widespread and cheap innovations are valuable indeed. Profit, though, often has a different calculus, the creation of things that (some) people think is worth paying extra for.","August 6, 2018","Value, Scarcity, Connection"
The truth about logos,"Here’s a simple test:
Ask a few people to name a logo they like.
With very few exceptions, people will choose a logo that’s associated with a brand they admire.
That’s because what makes a good logo is a good brand, not the other way around.","August 5, 2018","logos, branding, admiration"
The wrong bus,"Your first mistake was getting on the A53 bus, the one that goes crosstown instead of to where you're going.
Mistakes like this happen all the time.
The big mistake, though, the one that will cost you, is staying on that bus.
I know it wasn't easy to get on the bus. I know you got a seat. I know it's getting dark outside. But you're on the wrong bus, and staying on the wrong bus won't make it the right bus.
If you really want to get where you set out to go, you're going to have to get off the wrong bus.","August 4, 2018","wrong bus, mistakes, making changes"
The weather tax,"In the short run, weather emergencies can create a boost in the economy. They put people to work, require new building, emergency action and investment.
But like a war, these boosts are only temporary. Over time, the work and cost of dealing with weather that doesn’t match our expectations produces a significant drag on all of us.
There are significant human costs, of course, but for the bloodless economist, the costs of missed shipments, expensive commutes and ongoing spending to simply maintain the status quo begin to wear down the engines that create value for us, and more important, for our children.
We all pay a tax for an endless cycle of unpredictable weather, and get little in return.","August 3, 2018","weather tax, economic impact, human costs"
What gets maximized?,"When an organization succeeds, the owners decide what to maximize. Some of the choices:
So, if you’re the local cable company, you can decide to invest extra profits in customer service or lower rates, even if those choices don’t maximize long or short profitability. If you’re a public company, you might try to hype the stock price with a buyback. Or, if you’re a company with a mission, you might re-invest in that mission.
The myth is that the only purpose of a company is to maximize profits. That’s a fiction, and a dangerous one. Organizations exist to make things better for people, not the other way around.
One reason that social entrepreneurship is a useful concept is that it announces the priorities from the start. Be profitable enough to grow, but put most of that profit to work serving your customers and their neighbors.
You don’t have to have a fancy label to build an organization that you’re proud of. You simply need to decide what you’re trying to accomplish, and then go do that.

[Also! the new episode ofAkimbois out now, and a new podcast calledEverything is Aliveis the next thing you might want to listen to after that. I’ve listened to two episodes and they’re extraordinary acts of originality and genius.]","August 2, 2018","maximization, social entrepreneurship, organizational purpose"
The motor,"Here’s a simple hierarchy:
The self-driving car
Cruise control
Manual driving
Hitchhiking
Bicycling
Walking
The arc? As you move down the list, it gets harder and harder to coast. It moves from “set it once and forget it” to “one step at at time.”
The growth of audiobooks is outpacing reading. Why? Because audiobooks come with their own motor. Even readers are pointing out that they’ve forgotten how to read. But of course, that’s not true–we can still read a word, or even a sentence, it’s pushing ourselves through a chapter that’s difficult.
The internet is the greatest self-teaching resource ever developed. But few take advantage of it, because it doesn’t come with a motor. No tests, no certificates, no cruise control.
The decline of our personal momentum might be the great untold story of our time. That electronic media, incoming, ‘breaking’, please reply, didn’t you see that, react right now, click here… this has a cost. And the cost is our internal drive to initiate instead of to just react.
Someone’s driving. It’s either you, going where you choose, or someone else, pushing you.","August 1, 2018","motivation, self-driving, audiobooks"
Inadequacy on parade,"A never-ending stream of pictures. People who are prettier than you, happier than you, more confident than you. Weddings that are fancier than yours was, with sun-dappled trees, luscious desserts and delighted relatives. Or perhaps it’s the status updates from everyone who is where you aren’t, but wish you were.
And the billboards and the magazine ads always show us the people we’d like to be instead of the people we are.
In the short run, gazing at all this perfection gives us a short hit of dopamine, a chance to imagine what it might be like.
Over time, though, the grinding inadequacy caused by the marketing machine wears us down.
It’s okay to turn it off.

PS ConsiderThe Bootstrapper’s Workshop. Today, Sunday, is the last day to sign up for it, and we’re not sure when it will run again. If it’s for you, please don’t miss it.

“Zeige Deine Wunde” (show me your wound),"Joseph Beuys didn't make pretty art.
When I was 12, I saw an exhibit he had at the Guggenheim in NY. As its centerpiece was a 3,000 pound block of lard, wrapped in felt. It was bizarre, it smelled a bit and forty or more years later, I haven't forgotten it.
Beuys was transformed by near-death experiences he had as a youth. And that wound informed the art that he made. He shared his pain and more than that, the route to his salvation.
This isn't what we want from everything in our lives. We often choose convenience, solace or reassurance. But more often than we realize, the dance with fear and mortality and risk that others engage in becomes part of our cultural landscape.","September 29, 2018","Joseph Beuys, art, mortality"
The daily,"Is there something you do every day that builds an asset for you?
Every single day?
Something that creates another bit of intellectual property that belongs to you?
Something that makes an asset you own more valuable?
Something that you learn?
Every single day is a lot of days. It’s easy to look at the long run and lull yourself into skipping a day now and then.
But the long run is made up of short runs.

[And a first reminder that the February (!) session of thealtMBAis now accepting applications. I hope you’ll consider it.]","September 28, 2018","daily habits, intellectual property, asset building"
In search of your chord,"There are 88 keys on a piano.
64 colors in the big box of Crayola.
You can’t own a key and you can’t own a color.
But once you start combining elements, the possibilities go way up.
The opening chord of aHard Day’s Nightis a unique signature. So are the colors in a Lilly Pulitzerdress.
Your work can struggle to fit in. Or you can do the hard work of having it stand out.
As you can see from the notes on the single chord the Beatles developed, it’s not obvious or simple. And most of the time, it doesn’t even work. But if you find a chord and stick with it, again and again, for years, then, over time, it might become yours.

High value,"… is not the same as low price.
The price is obvious. It can be seen from a mile away. But value is more subtle. It often needs to be experienced to be understood.
The price is the same for every person who buys that item at retail. The value is different for everyone.
Low price is the last refuge for marketers who don’t have the patience or guts to demonstrate value for those that need it.","September 26, 2018","Value, Price, Marketing"

Kettle logic,"Originally the work of lawyers, it’s aconceptthat’s spreading, aided by the immediacy and unfiltered nature of social media.
In short: When you use contradictory excuses/statements to make an argument. Freud used this example:
A man who was accused by his neighbour of having returned a kettle in a damaged condition. He offered three arguments in rebuttal.
“I returned the kettle undamaged”“It was already damaged when I borrowed it”“I never borrowed it in the first place”
This is a dumb way to win a logical argument, because without a doubt, you’re lying in at least some of these statements.
Kettle logic is actually a glimpse into how the emotional side of our brain works. And of course, the emotional side is 95% of our brain. It’s squirming and the words simply get spun out.
When a customer or colleague begins to use kettle logic, the useful response is to seek out the emotions behind it. Because dismantling the logic part of kettle logic does nothing to get you closer to what the person really needs to talk about.",,"Kettle logic, emotional reasoning, contradictory arguments"
Like burning a hammer for heat,"Yes, it's true that your hammer has a wooden handle.
But throwing it in the fireplace to get a few BTUs out of it is a huge waste.

Don't burn it just because you're a little chilled.","September 23, 2018","reputation, relationships, trust"
"Mistakes, failures and problems","A mistake is something you learn from… you did it wrong, you’ll do it better next time.
A marketing failure is a mismatch between what you built and the market.
And a problem is an invention waiting to be built, an invitation to find a solution.","September 22, 2018","mistakes, failures, solutions"
The struggle is real,"Once a computer (or a player piano) begins to do a task, part of the appeal goes away.
Yes, the goods or services might be identical, but the story we tell ourselves about what they took to create disappears.
Effort is insufficient, but extraordinary effort (and our perception of that effort) can add value.","September 21, 2018","value, effort, perception"
Diving boards,"The leap at the swimming pool is obvious indeed.
Ten steps up the ladder.
The wait at the end of the board.
The moment in between not-diving and diving.
The leap is clear. We can see it and we can feel it.
In day to day life, we have worked to eliminate that feeling. Organizations and marketers and friends work hard to have it happen gradually instead. An incremental, almost invisible creep along a slippery slope, until the next thing we know we’re in a rut, or bored, or ill.
We’ve constructed a life where we rarely leap (new job!) and most of the time, we coast or fade or increment our way forward.
It might be worth investing the effort into turning some of your decisions back into leaps.","September 20, 2018","leap, decisions, incremental"
Semi-public,"The internet began as a way to connect private networks. First it was university researchers. But then, as email kicked in, it was a tool for private conversations among people who knew each other. That's just one of the reasons that spam is so hated–it intruded on a space reserved for people with permission.
The next leap was a public one. Geocities and websites. Facebook and Twitter. This is the public, all of the public, or at least as much as you care to engage with.
The interesting phase that's happening more and more, and is amplified by the blockchain, is the semi-public/semi-private world. This is a group of people (perhaps a tribe, even) that are connected to one another (insiders) but the riff raff (outsiders) aren't invited.
These semi-public groups can work together in ad-hoc or permanent teams to create new work of value.
Lyft isn't a public system. You can't become a Lyft driver without going through some sort of vetting process. The same goes for a discussion board online that's just for licensed doctors, or volunteer firefighters…
There's a huge opportunity to become an organizer of semi-public groups. These entities will become ever more powerful as the economies of the firm begin to fade, replaced by the speed and resiliency of trusted groups instead.","September 19, 2018","semi-public, blockchain, community"
Toward the honest job interview,"The candidate thinks, “I really need this job.”
The hiring manager thinks, “I’m tired of this, I really need to fill this job.”
As a result, the candidate says what he thinks will get him hired. He’s not listening, not really. And he’s not telling the truth, not really. He knows that he needs to thread a needle and say what needs to be said to get the job. He lies to himself about what he wants and lies to the interviewer to get the job.
As a result, the hiring manager isn’t really listening, not really. She’s looking for clues, unstated hints about what this person is really like. And when she shifts to sell mode about the organization, she alternates between glossing over the bad bits, exaggerating the good ones (“Everyone here is really creative, and there’s no office politics…”) and being impossibly skeptical about the potential of the person across the desk.
No one is acting badly here. Cognitive dissonance is real, and the hope is that once in the new role, the hired person will grow to love it. And no job is static, and the hope is that with the earnest and generous work of the hired person, the role will get better.
But…
We could all save a lot of time and energy if we could figure out a way to find an actual fit.
One person thinks, “I have room in my career for just a dozen jobs. Is this one worthy?”
And the other realizes, “We could outsource this work, but we’re going to keep it in house if we find the right match. Is it you?”","September 18, 2018","job interview, honesty, fit"
How to run a better meeting (The conference series),"You rarely have the chance to quickly alter the culture of a group the way you do when you organize a retreat or a meeting.
So many of the variables are within your control, and the outcome is often directly related to the choices you make. Sure, there are pressures on you to compromise toward average, to fit in and to make the providers you work with fit the status quo. But if you resist, you can make a huge difference.
I’ve written four posts about off-sites, presentations and conferences. If they’re relevant to you and your team, I hope you’ll read and share:

Skiing out of bounds,"Some people find a thrill in going under the rope and skiing on the cliffs or other terrain outside the ski area.
They’ll tell you that the runs are better.
But if the ski area extends the boundaries, suddenly those spots aren’t as attractive. Now, it’s thenextbit that’s seductive.
Because the thrill comes from the out of bounds part, not the skiing part.
A different feeling with a similar boundary issue is the magic of a first class seat. It doesn’t matter that first class seats are often smaller than they used to be. What matters is that they’re better than coach.
“Compared to what,” is often the cornerstone of our narrative.","September 16, 2018","Skiing, Out of Bounds, Thrill"
Zoom & Skype call tips (the secrets of video conferences),"If you’ve ever joined more than three people on a Skype or Zoom conference call, I hope you’ll appreciate these tips, and perhaps share them:

"Profitable, difficult, or important?","Apple became the first company to be worth a trillion dollars. They did that by spending five years single-mindedly focusing on doing profitable work. They’ve consistently pushed themselves toward high margin luxury goods and avoided just about everything else. Belying their first two decades, when they focused on breakthrough work that was difficult and perhaps important, nothing they’ve done recently has been either. Tim Cook made a promise to the shareholders and he kept it.
Amazon became the second company to be worth a trillion dollars. And just about everything they focus on is difficult. They carry more than a million products, ship on a moment’s notice, rarely have a glitch, host a bulk of the internet’s traffic and disrupt one industry after another. Tons of tiny details, many leaps. Investors have patiently waited for them to be incredibly profitable, but the company focuses on the relentless, incremental work of the difficult instead. A totally different promise, kept.
But the most daring and generous, those that are often overlooked and never hit a trillion dollars in the stock market, are left to do theimportantwork. The work of helping others be seen, or building safe spaces. The work of creating opportunity or teaching and modelling new ways forward. The work of changing things for the better.
Changing things for the better is rarely applauded by Wall Street, but Wall Street might not be the point of your work. It might simply be to do work you’re proud of, to contribute, and to leave things a little better than you found them.
Profitable, difficult, or important—each is an option. A choice we get to make every day. ‘None of the above’ is also available, but I’m confident we can seek to do better than that.","September 14, 2018","profitability, difficulty, meaningful work"
The risk of the Bixby button,"The new Samsung phone has a hardware button on it that goes straight to their digital assistant.
The good news is that adding a hotline/dedicated button/clear signpost is a dramatic and effective way to influence customer behavior. “Pull rope to stop train” is much more efficient than navigating three pages of menus. It also communicates your point of view and confidence to the user.
The problem is that Bixby buttons are also stepping stones on the way to cruft. Once you create a dedicated sign or button or resource, it’s very difficult touncreateit. The few who count on it will scream if you try to take it away. The elegance and efficiency of the tool you built will forever be hampered by the fact that you have to support a Bixby button.
Your microwave has 26 buttons on it now. Each one seemed like a good idea at the time.

What are you organizing?,"For a hundred years, we organized the means of production. How do we get the right people, the right machines, the right materials and get this thing built.
Many of us still do this. It’s important and difficult work.
For thirty years, most of the profit has been made by the people who organize money. How do we float an offer, manipulate a currency, bring the right money to the right project on the right day.
The return on organizing money is huge, and it’s not going away.
But now, now there’s a third kind of organization going on, one that’s even more leveraged, because it isn’t easily replaced: Organizing an audience.
How do we find the right people on the right day in a way that creates value for them and for us? How do we deliver the right service to the right audience in the right way? The rising stars of our economy are in this business now, even more than production or finance.

Education needs to be inconvenient,"It seems as though people now spend more time with their smartphones than they spend with other people, and the smartphone and app makers are working hard to make every interaction we make online ever moreconvenient.
Convenience sells.
It’s the dominant driver of our culture, and has been since the 60s. How can I get something that’s just good enough in exchange for it being more convenient? Hence the drive through fast food window, the microwave oven, the remote control, shrinkwrap licenses and 140 characters as a stand in for exchanging ideas.
It turns out that the quest for convenience also drives many of the choices we make about education. It’s more convenient to have standardized tests and rigid curricula, so we don’t have to treat every student differently. And it’s more convenient to imagine that continuing education for adults might involve reading a summary of something instead of actually doing it.
Alas, we’re confusing the convenience of physical time-saving with the convenience of not extending ourselves in the quest for something better.
Education needs to be inconvenient because it relies on effort and discomfort to move us from where we were to where we want to be. The internet gives us more access than ever, and if we care enough, we can use that convenient access to explore the inconvenient places that we know we should be exploring.
Here’s my annual link to my rant on education entitled,“Stop Stealing Dreams: What’s School For.”
And here’s the 18 minute video, which is a little more convenient.

And here’s a new viral video on the topic. Related to Ted Dintersmith’s newbook.

The trick question,"Useful modern education is not the work of rote. When you tell someone the answer and then give them a test to see if they remember what you told them, that’s not education, it’s incented memorization.
On the other hand, if you can ask someone a question that causes them to think about something unexamined, that challenges them to explore new ways of seeing the world or making connections, you’ve actually caused a change to happen.
The second time you ask them that question, it won’t work as well. Now it’s just rote. That’s why people call it a trick question. Because they learned something. They learned the trick.

What you’ll learn:A third way to be independent. Not the daily struggle of the gig-seeking freelancer, nor the high-stakes VC world of the big-time entrepreneur. Instead, the bootstrapper finds freedom early and often, by building an enterprise that customers want so much that they become the source of funding.
Bootstrapping is freedom via service. Finding ways to connect and lead and serve customers so well that they can’t imagine doing it without you.
How you’ll learn:The Bootstrapper’s Workshop is inspired by the five successful sessions of the Marketing Seminar. We’re using a customized online discussion platform, combined with short video lessons from me, to create cohorts of people who are sharing their best work (and challenges) with each other.
Instead of tests and certificates, this new way of learning revolves around peers, around real-time interactions and most of all, around projects and the work you do, instead of memorization and exams.
We start today.You can join anytime in the next few weeks, but if you sign up now, you can look for the purple circle at the bottom of the page and save some money. It’s disappears in a few days.
Can’t wait to see what you create.","September 5, 2018","Bootstrapping, Workshop, Community"
"First, fast and correct","All three would be great.
First… you invent, design, develop and bring to life things that haven’t been done before.
Fast… you get the work done quickly and efficiently.
Correct… and it’s right the first time, without preventable errors.
Being first takes guts. Being fast takes training. And being correct takes care.
All three at once is rare. Two would be great. And just one (any one) is required if you want to be a professional.
Alas, too often, in our confusion about priorities and our fear of shipping, we end up doing none and settling for average instead.","September 4, 2018","innovation, efficiency, professionalism"
The new Labor Day,"One day a year isn’t much to spend honoring the folks that built everything.
One day a year for the more than twenty that died from the heights and in the caissons as they built the Brooklyn Bridge.
One day a year to remember the 123 women and 23 men who died in the Triangle Shirtwaist tragedy.
And one day a year for the overlooked and disrespected, for the hardworking and the burnt out.
Of course, there’s still factory work to be done, but more and more, the labor each of us do is labor that can’t easily be done by a computer or a robot, work that requires emotional labor, that challenges us to lean just a little bit further into the unknown.
One of the factors that made hard labor palatable was that the economy didn’t offer a lot of choices. If you worked in Lackawanna, you probably worked a farm or in steel mill. It’s not like you spent a great deal of time wondering about what you might be doing instead.
Today, choices are everywhere. Which means that not only do we have to wrestle with insufficiency (of respect, of compensation, of reliable work) but we also have to take responsibility for our freedom. The freedom to choose something better, and even more important, the freedom to do work that matters.
We live in a world that’s moved by connection more than it is by heavy lifting. The connection of seeing and being seen, the connection of creating opportunity and value.
That shift isn’t easy, and for many, it’s painful. But that shift is up to each of us.
Today’s not just the end of summer. Today’s a day to plan how next summer might be very different for us and for those we seek to serve.
——
We’re launching the Bootstrapper’s Workshop on Wednesday because we know this is true. And we want to make the difficult work more possible, to create space for you to move forward, to lean in, and to connect with others who have made the choice to shift.","September 3, 2018","Labor Day, emotional labor, connection"
A good day for the backlist,"“What’s new?”
That’s a fine approach to staying up to date on a situation or field where you are well-informed. After all, if you notice what’s new and incorporate it with what you know, you’ll remain well informed. This is the thesis behind Slack and even email.
The small town police chief has been to every house, met every resident. Hearing about the changes in town are enough for her to stay on top of her job.
The deluge of information being created in every corner of the world, though, means that it’s really unlikely that we’re actually well-informed. Knowing what’s new isn’t sufficient to keep us informed.
It’s possible that you’ve heard every single recordedperformanceof the Grateful Dead, or read all ofIsaac Asimovor understand the nuances in the tax code. But it’s unlikely. And so, if you’re busy checking to see what’s new on the last Sunday of summer in the northern hemisphere, perhaps it makes sense to set the breaking news aside and take a look at the backlist instead.
You can search all of my blog posts at thislink. We’ve installed a new search engine and it’s fast and effective. Type in a concept you’re interested in (here’sone) and you might be surprised at what’s there.
That’s the beauty of the backlist. That, and you can always find more of it, whenever you’re ready.","September 2, 2018","backlist, information overload, staying informed"
The ends and the means,"Do the ends justify the means? Is it worth lowering your standards and giving up your principles in order to find a better outcome?
Many times, the meansarethe ends. How we choose to act changes who we choose to become.
The way we choose to get to where we're going defines what it's going to be like when we get there.","September 1, 2018","ethics, principles, outcomes"
"The first 1,000 are the most difficult","For years, I’ve been explaining to people that daily blogging is an extraordinarily useful habit. Even if no one reads your blog, the act of writing it is clarifying, motivating and (eventually) fun.
A collection of daily bloggers I follow have passed 1,000 posts (it only takes three years or so…). Fortunately, there are thousands of generous folks who have been posting their non-commercial blogs regularly, and it’s a habit that produces magic.
Sasha,Gabe, Fred,BernadetteandRohanadd value to their readers every day, and I’m lucky to be able to read them. (I’m leaving many out, sorry!) You’ll probably get something out of reading the work of these generous folks, which is a fabulous side effect, one that pays huge dividends to masses of strangers, which is part of the magic of digital connection.
What I’ve found is this–after people get to posting #200 or beyond, they uniformly report that they’re glad they did it. Give it a try for three or four months and see what happens…","October 31, 2018","daily blogging, writing habit, digital connection"
Just because you don’t understand it,"…doesn’t mean it isn’t true.
…doesn’t mean it isn’t important.
If we spend our days ignoring the things we don’t understand (because they must not be true and they must not be important) all we’re left with is explored territory with little chance of improvement.",,"Understanding, Importance, Exploration"
The problem with people is that they outnumber you,"It doesn’t make any sense to spend your life proving them wrong, it’s a losing battle.
Far more effective is the endless work of building connection, forming alliances and finding the very best you can in those you engage with.
You can’t possibly know what it’s like to be someone else, but it’s also true that no one knows what it’s like to be you.
One more reason to put in the effort to find the good.","October 30, 2018","connection, understanding, positivity"
Non-profit overhead,"Skeptical non-donors often point to the amount a charity spends on non-direct spending as a reason to hesitate in contributing. It’s easy to imagine that a cause that spends 90% of what it raises on direct action (not HQ, not salaries, not fundraising) is better than one that spends 80%.
We say we care about overhead, but what we really care about is impact, or status, or momentum. What we measure isn’t a simple percentage, it’s a lot deeper than that.
Waste isn’t a good thing. Of course not. But leaving aside the football teams and the jets at some colleges, those high salaries at some non-profits might just be buying insights and effort that you can’t get any other way. And those leaders might be bringing strategic insights and efficiencies to their cause that a well-meaning bootstrapper just can’t deliver.
Everywhere else in our lives, we happily invest in the best solution to our problem. Whether it’s surgery, vegetables or a designer, we seek to invest in expertise and resources that not only fit our budget but get the job done.
If a problem is worth solving, it’s worth engaging with the right people to solve it with urgency, isn’t it?","October 29, 2018","Non-profit overhead, impact, investment"
Ambidextrous,"Anthropologists have found that we’re very motivated to divide into teams, and once on a team, we’ll work hard to degrade the other team. Over the smallest differences. For the smallest possible stakes. Even when we get no other benefit than thinking that we won something.
We spend a lot of time sorting people into buckets. We label them in order to treat them differently and establish expectations for how they’ll respond. Mostly to figure out which team they’re on. An email from a stranger causes us to spend some time guessing their status, gender and connection to us.
Which team?
Strangely, we don’t care so much about whether someone is right handed or left handed. We don’t waste cycles on dividing people by whether they can curl their tongue or even if they can play the piano.
I totally understand our caring about Yankees vs. Red Sox. About seeking out team affiliation when team affiliation is a choice, when it’s intentionally competitive, when it tells us something about what’s going to happen next.
But if we’re not sure of someone’s gender, religion, citizenry, sexual orientation or race, we can get very uptight. Ambidextrous (unsorted) in these areas is a problem, apparently, even though there’s no relationship (zero) between the things that matter (attitude, skills, talents) and the easily measured team affiliation that we all seem so concerned about.
And that leads to a great opportunity. If you can be the person who coordinates the work of people regardless of their designated unasked-for affiliation, you’ll be able to find brilliant contributors that others foolishly overlook.
The room has more room than ever for those willing to be ambidextrous, to follow a path that’s not previously defined. Work with them or get out of their way.","October 28, 2018","Team affiliation, Ambidextrous, Diversity"
Stet,"There’s a term in copyediting called “stet.”
That’s what you write when you want the copyeditor tonotmake the indicated change. It’s probably Latin for, “leave my best work alone, please.”
Too often, in a committee, we bend to the fear of those that would prefer we fit in, dumb it down and average it out.
Better, I think, to simply say, “stet.” No drama, no explanation. Simply, “stet.”
Your work is worth it.","October 27, 2018","stet, copyediting, originality"
The antidote,"It’s worth picking a philosophy that’s self correcting.
The antidote to junk science is more science, good science. Science is a self-correcting process, where transparency leads to improvement.
The antidote to bad engineering is more engineering. Engines and bridges run better today than they did a hundred years ago.
The antidote to blind obedience to unexamined edicts and principles, though, isnotmore obedience. It doesn’t self correct. It gets worse.

[For those interested in constructive innovation instead of obedience, please consider thealtMBA. Today’s the early deadline for our next session.]","October 26, 2018","philosophy, science, innovation"
Make better promises,"We spend so much of our time keeping promises, fretting about promises, whittling down promises… that we rarely put the effort into creating better ones.
More generous.
More urgent.
More personal.
Your brand is a promise and your work is delivering on it.
What have you promised us lately?","October 25, 2018","promises, branding, commitment"
Lumpers and splitters,"There are two interesting ways to solve a problem, find a startup or even write a blog post.
You can lump two previously disparate categories into one.
Or you can split a previously coherent category into two or more pieces.
Amazon is a lumper. They lumped 1,000 individual markets for bookstores into one giant one. They lumped dozens of different kinds of retail stores into one big one.
A high-end barber shop is a splitter. It doesn’t cut all hair. Just men. Not all men, just men who want to spend $50 on the experience.
You can choose to lump or to split, but either one will show you a new way forward.","October 24, 2018","Lumpers, Splitters, Problem-Solving"
