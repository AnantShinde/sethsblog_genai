What would Jerry do?,"Articles about the Grateful Dead have the inevitable snarky headline (Jerry Garcia: The Man, the Myth, the Area Rug – New York Times) and often try to trivialize what the band accomplished, or make the case that it was a unique occurence, something that will never happen again.
Of course, this is nonsense.
More than Campbell’s Soup or American Airlines or CAA or Cisco or McKinsey, the Grateful Dead is the template for how organizations are going to grow and succeed moving forward.
No, not every element of who they were and what they did, but the idea of conversations and open source, the idea of souvenirs and emotion and live events and of remarkability. The Dead sells through permission marketing, spread their music through an ideavirus and yes, as long as we’re slinging buzzwords, profits from the long tail.
The most important takeaway is this: They repeatedly did things that felt like huge risks, that challenged the status quo and that seemed, on their face, to give too much power to their audience. And in those moments, the Grateful Dead were at their most successful.","August 9, 2005","Grateful Dead, permission marketing, innovation"

The wrong question,"For the last six years, people in big media have been asking me one question: ""How will new media work for the big advertisers?"" This is paraphrased over at:gapingvoid: the multi-billion dollar suicide pact between clients and television.
While it’s human nature to be selfishly focused on your issues, there is a bias implicit in the question that’s fatal to the entire discussion. The question shouldn’t be, ""How do we use this different media to replace the media* that’s broken?"" (*""media for big advertisers"".)
The right question is, ""How does this new media change the game for all the players?"" How does it move upstream and influence everything from what gets made to who makes it to how much is charged…
Can the world of blogs etc. help Budweiser? Only on the margins. The world of new media is not the place to launch the next one-size-fits-all mega brand, nor is it the place to shore a flagging brand like that up.
Instead of using new media to promote the next megafilm from Disney or Julia Roberts, it permits movies likeWAL-MART: The High Cost of Low Priceto get made at all.
Instead of using new media to promote brands like Budweiser, it permits that very same megabrewer to launch brands that tell a much more vertical, more focused, more powerful story to a smaller group of people.
Instead of promoting mainstream political parties and mainstream political ideas, it provides donations and vocal support to the fringes.
I don’t think new media leads us to products that are better or more healthful or honest, necessarily. I think it clearly leads us to products (and the stories about them) that are far more focused.

Look who’s talking,"Did you ever wonder why William Seward wasn’t nominated for president instead of Abraham Lincoln?
Neither did I.
Turns out that he almost was. Except for the seating chart.
Joseph Medill was a hugely powerful figure, the editor of the Chicago Tribune back when being editor of a newspaper actually meant something. He had a falling out with Seward, and Seward made the mistake of saying to Medill, ""Henceforth, you and I are parted… I defy you to do your worst.""
Well, somehow Medill ended up as the holder of the seating chart for the Republican convention in which Seward and Lincoln battled it out. And he did a very clever thing. He seated the Pennsylvania delegation, which was on the fence, in a spot surrounded by Lincoln states, far far away from the Seward states.(thanks to Peter Lamont’s book on the Indian Rope Trick for the story).

Truth is not marketing (though sometimes marketing with the unvarnished truth is a great story), and humans are far more likely to engage and embrace and believe marketing than they are to believe the truth.

This is brilliant story telling in that it resonates with what a lot of peoplewantto hear. It fits their worldview. It allays their fear of the unknown and resolves internal conflicts.
Of course it’s not ""true."" Of course it’s not ""science."" That doesn’t mean the idea isn’t popular and it doesn’t mean the idea won’t spread.
The brilliance of the story is that by asserting that there’s a debate over something, youcreatethat debate! Say it often enough and stick with it long enough, and in fact you create a debate that wasn’t there before.
Please don’t misunderstand me. This is not a post about the origin of life. I really don’t want to hear from anyone on this topic.

I changed my mind yesterday,"…Actually, I changed it a lot.
As alert readers know, I’ve been holed up all summer, working on a new project that will debut this fall. We’ve got an exceptional team of people, and the invention process has been refreshing, fascinating and completely energizing.Yesterday was the second day of a marathon 11-person meeting. We started at A and worked our way all the way to Z, considering the features, strategies and stories of everything we’re building. And I watched myself change my mind, not once but quite a few times.
I don’t know how it is for you, but for me, when I change my mind something chemical happens. I go from one mental state to another and I can feel something flip. What’s interesting (and particularly relevant to you and to your customers) is that a person can easily insulate himself from this flip.
It’s very easy to walk into a conversation with someone with theintentto persuade, but not to be persuasive. If the person you’re talking with (or marketing to) sets out to not change her mind, it’s very unlikely that any other outcome will occur.
Last week, I flew to Buffalo. The flight was full and I was on standby. It was a cheap flight and I really needed to get to my meeting in Buffalo. I decided it was worth $100 to get on board. And all I needed to do was persuade one person to give up their seat and I’d be fine.
New airport rules don’t make this easy, but it turns out that if someone ahead of you on the standby list gets on the plane but decides against it, that’s permitted. So I camped out and waited for the standbys to get called.
First person, about 20 years old, obviously a student, gets called. The next flight out (for which she has a ticket) is in ninety minutes. “Hi,” I say, calmly taking $100 in cash out of my pocket. “I’ll pay you $100 to take the next flight—the one you’re already on—so I can take this one and make my meeting.”
Now, my guess is that this woman has rarely made $65 an hour to read a novel. But that’s precisely what she turned down without a thought. She smiled, said no thanks and got on the plane.
The next two guys to clear standby had precisely the same reaction. I didn’t get on.
My guess is that I could have offered $1,000 and it wouldn’t have mattered.
Why?
Because for an hour, the people on standby had been imagining/visualizing/praying that they’d make the earlier flight. They had fallen into the human trap of believing that mental effort can impact external events. And when the thing they’d been dreaming of happened, they were sold. There was no way a short conversation with me would change their mind. Not because my offer wasn’t good, or my presentation was deficient or I wasn’t credible. No, because they’d already decided and they weren’t open to changing their mind.
This phenomenon is absolutely critical inside your organization.There’s no point whatsoever in having a meeting designed to elicit change if the attendees are insulated against changing their minds.Assuming you are surrounded by co-workers who are willing to try, it’s essential you go through exercises designed to loosen up the flip muscle.
Ironically, the setting and tone of a conference room work to create precisely the opposite effect. Business meetings (and sales calls) are custom-made for failure. People walk in and are reminded (in an overwhelmingly Proustian way) that this is the place to stand your ground, this is the place where good arguments carry the day and build careers, and weak-kneed flip-floppers hurt their careers. When was the last time you changed your mind in a conference room?
My recommendation? As a group, start by changing your (everyone’s) mind about something astonishingly simple, obvious and unimportant. Establishing a pattern in which people flip (no flopping, just flipping) is the first step to creating an atmosphere where things actually get done.
And what about outside your organization? How on earth are you going to sell something to someone when you don’t get to meet them, don’t get to pick the conference room, don’t have the leverage to insist on change?
Well, you can argue against human nature or you can follow a two part strategy:
1.    sell to people in the mood to flip. Pick an audience that for all sorts of external reasons is open to changing their minds. Example: people who just moved to a new town, just started college, just got a new job, just bought a new car. The value of these groups is well-known, but still underestimated. People who are reading a magazine about new ideas are a lot more receptive to new ideas than those rushing to catch the commuter train to work…
2.    Start a cascade of small flips. Apple argued for years that people should abandon the Windows platform and switch to the Mac. It’s better. It’s faster. It’s cooler. It’s proven. No dice. Mostly because Windows users refused to even consider switching. BUT, when it comes to music, getting someone to flip to an iPod from a walkman was a lot easier. And then, gradually, as people open up to flipping the other electronics in their life, Apple has a voice in that conversation.
Sometimes, people who come to my blog come with the intent of changing their mind about something. I’m hoping I can get you to change your mind about changing minds. If you’re one of those folks who’s predisposed to flip, ask yourself the following questions before you try to persuade anyone of anything:
Is this person in a situation (emotional, professional, even architecturally) where they are pre-disposed to flip?
And
How can I get them to make a tiny flip? And then another one?

Open Big,"That’s what Hollywood wants. Martha Stewart is a write off because her first episode of the Apprentice had horrible ratings. That female president show, on the other hand, is on a roll. The irony, of course, is that these ratings are based on the promotion and the premise, not the show itself–they reflect viewershipbeforeword of mouth or first-hand experience.
We all want to open big. We want our product launches to be instant successes. We want the resumes we send out to be opened in one day, a call the next, an interview the third and a corner office by the end of the week.
The new marketing, it appears, doesn’t work that way.
This is blog post #1,002 for me (I was so busy blogging today, the milestone flew right past… sorry). When I first started (thanks, Joi) many years ago, my readership was tiny. Just a few people a day.

Permission Marketing : Turning Strangers Into Friends And Friends Into Customers. a book I wrote seven (SEVEN) years ago just went back to  press at the publisher and continues to sell. Unleashing the Ideavirus, which you can get for free online or in a handy paperback edition, came out five years ago… but they’re just now launching trade organizations around the ideas in it.
The bottom line is that it’s way way easier to start things than it used to be (opening a movie big costs a tenth of abilliondollars, while opening a blog costs about twenty). The natural, user-driven networks that make a product succeed or fail rarely hit all at once. But the snowball effect online is far more powerful than the old-world scream & dream approach.
So, what’s it mean to you?

Well, the reason the idea spread so fast is that Apple is eminently viral, especially re: negative stories about new stuff.Report: Apple to replace iPod nanos with broken screens – Sep. 28, 2005
The thing is, I think we’re noticing this a whole lot more than the general public. (the line to buy Nanos at my local Apple store was huge). And I think there’s a danger here, because alert marketers are also online a lot, and if you drink your own koolaid, it can backfire (by the way, there wasn’t Kool Aid at Jonestown, it was Flavor Ade… another example of how ideas spread and leave a history).
Yes, Apple discovered that 1% of the Nanos were defective, and yes, within a week, they agreed to take them back. Good for them. But no, this isn’t the sort of groundswell public conversation that all the online pundits (like me) keep telling you about.
You never get a second chance to make a first impression. Noted. But you also never get a chance to tell a great story with a boring product.

What makes an idea viral?,"For an idea to spread, it needs to be sent and received.
No one ""sends"" an idea unless:a. they understand itb. they want it to spreadc. they believe that spreading it will enhance their power (reputation, income, friendships) or their peace of mindd. the effort necessary to send the idea is less than the benefits
No one ""gets"" an idea unless:a. the first impression demands further investigationb. they already understand the foundation ideas necessary to get the new ideac. they trust or respect the sender enough to invest the time
This explains why online ideas spread so fast but why they’re often shallow. Nietzsche is hard to understand and risky to spread, so it moves slowly among people willing to invest the time. Numa Numa, on the other hand, spread like a toxic waste spill because it was so transparent, reasonably funny and easy to share.
Notice that ideas never spread because they are important to the originator.
Notice too that a key dynamic in the spread of the idea is the capsule that contains it. If it’s easy to swallow, tempting and complete, it’s a lot more likely to get a good start.
But that doesn’t mean that there’s no role for mystery or ideas that unfold over time. In fact, the unmeasurable variable here isstyle.Howard Dean’s ideas spread at the beginning–not because of the economic ramifications of his immigration policy, but because of the factors above. The way they were presented fit into the worldview of those that spread them.
A key element in the spread of ideas is their visual element. iPods and visual styles spread faster in the real world than ephemeral concepts. Pictures and short jokes spread faster online because the investment necessary to figure out if they’re worth spreading is so tiny.
And of course, plenty of bad ideas spread. Panic, for instance, is a superbad idea at all times, but it spreads faster than most. That’s because spreading an idea is rarely a thoughtful, voluntary act. Instead, it is near the core of who we are, and we often do it without thinking much about the implications.",,"viral ideas, spread, communication dynamics"

How much would you pay to be on Oprah’s TV show?,"What would happen to your organization if you had a solid ten minutes with her majesty? How much benefit would you receive if you were able to tell your story to millions of people on television? Of course, you can’t pay to be on Oprah, but if you could, no doubt you would.
This simple thought exercise exposes the paradox that we’re finding online.
Should authors get paid to put their work into Google Print, the online service that lets you search for information inside a book?
How do you measure how much to invest in a blog?
The persistent reporter who spoke to me the other day wouldn’t stop asking the same question, “What percentage of your annual sales are directly attributable to your blog?” Perhaps you’ve heard the same question from your boss. Proof is what they seek! Management doesn’t want to invest in new media without understanding what the short-term payoff is. Authors don’t want to “give away” content without proof that it’ll pay off.
But they’d all pay to be on Oprah.
That local paper, the one that struggles to make its subscription and newsstand guarantee every day, wants you to register before you can read an article online. And they want to know a lot about you (your gender, your date of birth) before they will allow you to pay attention to your site.
The same company that runs ads hoping you’ll buy a newspaper that costs more to print than it does to sell, puts up roadblocks to keep you from reading online.
Wait.
“Pay attention” are the key words. The consumer is already paying. You’re paying with a precious commodity called attention. Instead of fending you off and holding you back, perhaps the newspaper ought to be making it easier to give your precious attention to them…
A quick gut check will probably confirm what many of us truly believe: the number of channels of communication is going to continue to increase. And either you’ll have a channel or you won’t. Either you’ll have access to the attention of the people you need to talk with, (notice I didn’t say talk “at”) or you won’t.

Do billboards work?,"Red Maxwell sends in this great photo. He reports that for the first week, all six muffins were in place.
My colleague Jay Levinson taught me that the two best words to have on a billboard are, ""next exit."" I have serious doubts that you can cost-effectively sell an item that isn’t a ""right now"" purchase from a billboard, though. I’m have no doubts at all that hospitals have no business whatsoever running ads on billboards. ""Oh, George, you’ve been thinking of having heart surgery–look at this great ad from Memorial Hospital!""
So, yes, it’s funny and even memorable. But is it selling muffins or a particular brand of muffins? If I got a muffin craving from this ad, would I pay extra for these particular muffins?",,"billboards, advertising, consumer behavior"

When you spend all day making stuff (and making it better) it’s easy to get carried away with the magic of your stuff. You (and your team) believe that your service, your candidate, your new product–whatever it is–is so powerful and well-priced and effective that any rational person will choose to buy it instead of the competition.
But what if you’re selling it in the wrong place?Or with the wrong tone of voice?
I think context is underrated. Especially online.
Yes, Amazon sells just about everything, but my bet is that you could build an online process that would dramatically increase the yield per click that they receive (for your product, anyway).
The narrative of discovery is an essential part of how someone decides to try your product. What did the click before your site look like? What’s that missionary wearing?
Marketers are terrible at thinking about this and worse still at sussing it out. How many times have you heard (or read on a form) ""how did you hear about us?"" That’s an okay question, but not nearly as important as, ""what was going through your head in the moment before you decided to take a huge risk and buy something from us for the first time?"" Of course, you can’t ask that question, but that’s what you need to know.
Some blogs don’t sell very hard. They’re not filled with ALL CAP COME ONS or frequent, nearly constantlinks to all the stuff you can buyorlinks to the latest postive reviews.Other blogs, on the other hand, have a very different posture. They make it clear to the reader that the purpose of the blog is to sell something, and they do it over and over again, to apparently great success. What’s going on here?
What’s happening is a shift in context.
Salespeople are often effective because they make it clear from the first moment that they are salespeople. They are trying to sell you something. That makes the conversation authentic and transparent and goal-oriented. Others succeed because they take precisely the opposite tack, selling trust first and products second. I think both approaches can work, but being muddled about what you’re doing never will.
The Zagat restaurant guides had a breakthrough early on because they were able to get distribution in places that weren’t bookstores–like the counter of the local Korean deli. By intentionally changing the context, they stood out enough to reach people in a different mindset.
On the other hand, the guy who tried to pitch me financial services as I was packing up my computer after a speech didn’t have a prayer.

OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT!,"One of my fondest memories of adolescence was staying home on a Saturday night and watching Garrett Morris do his politically incorrect riff on SNL*. He would cup his hands around his mouth and yell the top stories on the news–for those who might be hard of hearing.
Sometimes bloggers need to do the same thing.
We assume that our readers have been around for a while, understand our metaphors, our shorthands, the shortcuts we use to make a point.
Bad idea.
When I wrote myAkron postI suspected I’d get flack for it, but I had no idea how personal the attacks would be. Basically, they begin with, ""I’ve never read anything you’ve ever written…"" and conclude with, ""Because of your poor judgment, I won’t ever read anything you write ever again, or buy your books either.""
Of course, given the first sentence, the closing sentence isn’t much of a threat, but it also represents a common human trait and one that more careful writing could probably avoid. Regular readers know that I wasn’t makingany comment at allabout Akron… merely a comment about a few of the people who live there. Just as I wasn’t criticizing every struggling dot com company, just the group I was interacting with.
Organizations are nothing but people, and their attitudes have a lot to do with their future.
Not in all caps, but I think that makes it more clear.
As for those that will never read my blog again, you’re probably not reading this either, and I hope that a friend who still does will let you know that I’m officially apologizing to anyone who thought that I had issued an edict re Akron. I haven’t, I’m not and I won’t.

"The end of Akron, part I, stale bread","I just got back from giving a talk to a great group in Akron, OH.
The city is near death.
I haven’t consulted any almanacs or economic factbooks, and I’m sure I’ll hear from the mayor soon, but you can see it.
Someone at the conference explained to me that when you go to one of these events, you never leave the hotel anyway. That the hotel room, the lobby, the ballroom and the restaurant are all the same.
Nonsense.
It starts with the bread they serve at dinner. The people in the restaurant have given up. The bread (on a Thursday!) is stale. The chefs don’t care about what they’re doing, and the waiters don’t care about their customers. The people I encountered (more than a dozen), were, with just one exception, beaten. Stooped shoulders and sad eyes, they’ve given up.
This wouldn’t matter to you, except I saw precisely the same behavior at a dot com company I visited in NY earlier this week. The same look of failure, the same feeling of impending, slow, inexorable doom.
A few minutes later, I had another meeting and it was completely different. The attitude, at a company in essentially the same business, couldn’t have been more different. The answer to every question was ""why not?"" instead of ""why?""

"The end of Akron, part II, football","Driving to Akron for my talk, I had the chance to hear a great speech on public radio. It was one of those local things where they broadcast from a club for local leaders. The guest was the lawyer instrumental in keeping the Cleveland Browns football team in Cleveland.
Quick background: About ten years ago, the Browns’ owner, Art Modell, up and announced he was going to Baltimore. Did the entire deal in secret and left in the middle of the night. There was a huge uproar and lobbying, protests, Congressional hearings and more. The city, in conjunction with the NFL, ended up building a stadium that cost the city more than $300 million and the NFL chipped in with a new team.
It turns out that virtually every one of the 170 plus pro sports teams in the US has a newish stadium, and that those buildings have cost more than $25 billion to build… with most of it paid for by taxpayers. And it turns out that almost none of them pay off, that they are impossible to justify by economic analysis.
The lesson:Havinga football team is meaningless.
What matters islosinga team orgaininga team.
If Cleveland had lost its team, the morale of the city, even non-fans, would have been devestated. But Buffalo has and keeps its team and it doesn’t matter a bit.
When Tennessee got a team, it was a huge shot in the arm to the story the region tells itself.
Organizations of all stripes have the football problem (and opportunity). Launching a brand (or shuttering it), opening an office, doing a layoff–all of these events change the story stakeholders tell themselves. And the story has little to do with the economic reality and everything to do with self-image.",,"Akron, football teams, economic impact"
Keep the change…,"Rick Liebling writes and reminds me of a pet peeve. He stopped at theCinnabonin Penn Station and his treat came to $3.03 with tax. Now, he has to hassle looking for change, or break a bill, and the store has to hassle with breaking the bill and shlepping lots of pennies to and from the bank. In the long run, they may even need to hire another clerk because productivity is hit.
How does this happen?
Well, it’s because the price is set by corporate, I guess. And corporate doesn’t know or care what NY State tax is. And it’s too hard for them to think it through.
But do you know what’s really hard? And what would work better?
They ought to RAISE the price on everything in store a few pennies. Then they should teach their clerks to always round off the pennies. So if a check comes to $5.05, the clerk says, ""don’t worry about the nickel.""
Don’t worry about the nickel!

Bureaucracy = Death,"So, we learn today that theF.A.A. was Alerted on Qaeda in ’98, 9/11 Panel Said – New York Times. Cockpit door locks would have saved thousands of lives.
A good friend is speaking at a major philanthropy conference and the organizers won’t permit him to distribute a one page flyer about his organization. They are ""too busy"" to approve it.
Gave a talk to a pharma company last week, and the marketers there are wringing their hands because of the sea change in the way people view their work. No, they’re not evil. Yes, the mindless bureaucracy continued to grind out products and ads and policies that weren’t in anyone’s best interest.
The victims of New Orleans know firsthand what happens when a large bureaucracy with lots of money and not enough responsibility fails to action when it should.
And what does all this have to do with marketing?
Easy.
Very little remarkable comes out of bureaucracies for a simple reason. The members of the bureaucracy seek to bebeyond reproach. Reproach is their nightmare, their enemy, the thing to avoid at all costs. And the remarkable feels like a risk.
Here’s an idea I wrote about in abooka long time ago:
Appoint a CNO—chief no officer. No longer can someone say no to an idea and leave it at that. If you want to turn something down, you’ve got to pass it on to your boss. Then either he says yes or gives it to his boss. For a ""no"" to be official, it’s got to be approved by the chief no officer and countersigned by every manager along the way.
So, what would have happened if the FAA or FEMA had a CNO? Who would have had the guts to turn down cockpit door locks if saying ""no"" meant the idea would go upstairs?
And what happens to any organization that creates a culture where maintaining the status quo requires your boss to give you the okay?
Of course, it’s not this simple. But the very act of talking about it helps people focus on what’s killing their organization. I don’t care if you’re in radio, packaged goods, organized religion or an online merchant.

"Fear of loss, desire for gain","Found myself in the mall this weekend (gasp) at a Lord & Taylor (go figure) and discovered the oddest promotion.
After I purchased $200 worth of stuff, the salesperson said, ""you qualified for two gift certificates worth $40. No strings attached. Go upstairs and you can get them right now.""
Note: no notice before the purchase. No signs, no promises. The certificates weren’t designed as an inducement to get me to buy anything.
""Why would they spend 10% of revenue and perhaps 30% of profit for no reason?"" I wondered.
I headed upstairs, waited for two minutes and got my certificates, just so I could let you, my gentle readers, know about this crazy scheme. Walked over to the tie department and bought $39 worth of beautiful ties, marked down from $100 (hey, I’m cheap…) and I was done.
On my way out, I passed this woman:Here’s her deal. She was on her FOURTH batch of gift certificates. Every time she got $20, she needed to spend it right away. She ended up spending more than $100 each time, so she then went back to get another ceritificate or two, but needed to spend it, and on and on and on. A quick talk with the gift certificate dispensing person confirmed that this was far from unusual behavior. It was a frenzy.
So, people ""earn"" the certificate, but unable to resist the fear of losing what was theirs, went over and collected it. But now that they have it, it’s ""free money"" so they go and spend it, and the cycle continues.

We’re also looking for a person (the same person!) who gets along well with both non-engineers and Linux boxes, who can integrate the work of freelance programmers and also code what needs to be coded.
Our Chief Engineer will work closely with our head of IT, who worries about server loads and long-term planning. The person we hire needs to have a strong voice when it comes to technical issues, but, at the same time, be able to seamlessly integrate with a non-technical organization. The kind of person who would be happy working at Craig’s List or Six Apart or Basecamp. We have a killer espresso machine, health benefits and a lot of momentum. Did I mention our office is less than twenty steps from the Hudson River, sixty steps from Metro North and is next door to a brand-new health club and a kayaking marina?

No, there’s no impending natural disaster. No one boarding up windows. It’s just 9:30 on a Sunday morning.
There’s more than 40 people waiting!

If the machines are productive (and they appear to be, though they aren’t particularly well designed) why not have ten or twenty or fifty not just four (with two broken ones).
It worked with ATM machines… the lesson to anyone visiting Home Depot is: we don’t care, if you want low prices, suck it up and get in line.

Frankly, I was expecting to wait for several hours as I negotiated a tired, volunteer-based system.
What an amazing surprise. The system was cheerful, rational, swfit and beautifully thought out. I worked with three different volunteers (two on forms, one with the swabs) and was done in less than six minutes. Today, this dedicated team is going to process more than 1,000 volunteers in less than four hours.
I left feeling like I had helped out, but I also left feeling impressed with the organization and ready to spread the word to others that might be thinking of volunteering.
I couldn’t help comparing the two processes. Couldn’t help wondering about the difference between people who care and people who don’t, about processes designed to serve all concerned and those designed to stamp out shoplifting…

Hello Seth,
I just read the letter from Acland Brierty on your blog. As asuccessful website-publisher (as well as someone who sells-paidcontent) I’d like to share my opinions.
Because I never saw her ""free"" site I don’t know exactly how theyapproached using Adsense. Was a sales letter offered? Was the entirebook converted to HTML and split up on many different pages? How muchsearch engine traffic where they receiving?
From reading the post, it sounds to me like she was making peoplesign up to read the free e-book — and then supporting it withAdsense. That is a very counter-productive way to run aadvertising-supported website (and yes, a lot of newspapers are doing— and losing out on a boatload of revenue.)
I think its a huge mistake if any of your readers dismiss the Adsensemodel — and here is why:
This is a direct quote fromMarketingSherpa
""Tim Carter of Askthebuilder.com actually made the move from asubscription site to an ad-supported business. Although he made over$9,000 in the first nine months as a subscription site, he ended upwith a deficit of $8,800. Then, I started the AdSense program withGoogle. Suffice it to say I can average $1.35 per page per day andIve got something like 1,400 pages, he said.""
There is a good reason his advertising pays off — he has a lot of""free"" how-to articles which will require the reader to purchasesproducts and services which make the advertisers big money. That, andhe correctly implemented Adsense onto his site.
When running an advertising-supported website the technical aspectsare critical. A good clickthrough rate easily can mean the differencebetween losing money and being very profitable. This Adsense Webinartranscript describes changes Tim made that increased his clickthroughrates dramatically (it’s near the bottom):link
""Free"" advertising-supported sites work because there is a profitableproduct paying for the advertising (or an advertiser who isn’tcalculating his ROI.)
If you really want to make a lot of money then you need to tacticallyuse free content to sell your own premium content/product/service.
That is *the* key to successfully using free and paid content.",,"AdSense, free content, advertising-supported website"

Is “free” all it’s cracked up to be?,"Acland Brierty writes:
Hi Seth,I saw your last blog post; ‘forty to one’ and wanted to share with you some interesting things we found when we made everything on our site FREE. We brought all our job-winning tools under one roof and gave them away… that’s over $250 or more in value for free. The idea was that we would use a TV model and let google adsense become our income stream. Now here’s what we found: the sign up rate went up only fractionally more than when we used to charge for the individual components (and that is based on our most popular item, an ebook called job secrets revealed).
Now here’s the best bit… revenues fell through the floor. People just weren’t clicking the ads… and I’m going to share with you a stunning lesson we learned from adsense in a minute.
Anyhow, I saw your blog and I was thinking about all of this and then I thought to myself, here is what Seth is going to say:
""you guys just don’t have a good relationship with your clients etc etc""
The difference for us is that we were trying to give away something that already exists, for free, to people that knew us and already had it… OR … to people that had no idea what or who we were. In ‘forty to one’, on the other hand, you are giving away a NEW idea and book to people who like what you do and want more and they don’t have a copy of ‘knock knock’.
So we abandoned the FREE model and started to charge for it again and our sign-up rate increased… I guess that in some cases FREE means that it has no value. We did get a few comments from people saying that they were always waiting for a ‘catch’ on our free site. You know, sign up for free but if you want the really good stuff it will cost you $$$… so they were amazed when this never came.
Just thought I’d share the experience.
Thanks for the note… my take is actually this:1. if it costs money, many people value it more highly.2. if it costs money, many more of the ‘buyers’ pay an increased amount of attention.3. if it costs money, you get a better shot at future interactions, because the stakes are higher
That’s one reason why college degrees are worth more than reading a lot of books in the library, say, or even work experience.
The real question here is order of magnitude. If charging for something online only cuts your volume in half, it’s almost certainly worth it. But as more and more outlets are training people that good stuff can be free, it’s going to get harder to sell digital information.
As for ads, clearly there are some topics and some audiences that are far more likely to click on ads than others. More on this soon. (PS Acland (he’s a he) adds some morehere.)",,"free model, value perception, digital information"

Blogs, on the other hand, are changing the consumption of information far far faster than either of those two outlets ever did. Yes, it’s different, it’s not a winner take all world, but no, that doesn’t make the opportunity any less interesting.
IfKnockKnockthe ebook I published in June, is about how to make websites do their job better, then it’s only natural to turn our attention to blogs.

Who’s Thereis not an ebook about how to write better or how to follow the traditional conventions about formatting and building a blog. It’s not designed to sell you one service instead of another, either.
Instead, I divide the blog world into three groups and turn my attention to one. And in particular, I try to sell you hard on how building a blog asset can have a spectacular impact on you, your career, your organization and your ideas.
I promise this ebook is incomplete. I hope, though, that it encourages you to pay attention to some of the underlying forces at work online and off. And it’s small enough to email to your colleagues or to post on your own site. Hey, it’s free and it comes with its own carrying case.

Tools vs. Craftsmen,"Sunday morning and I’m watching an eleven-year old make a stop-motion animated movie.
He’s using tools that would have cost $100,000 or more a decade ago. And today, of course, they’re supercheap.
You can typeset using the finest graphic design tools ever made–for fifty cents a minute at Kinko’s, or at home with a $500 Mac Mini.
You can post your resume in more places and reach more people than any outsourcing firm ever could
And my friends at eyebeam just got a fancy 3D printer that allows them ""output"" just about any small three dimensional object they can imagine.
If you want to write a book, go ahead. You can write it and typeset at home, and get it professionally printed with no problem. And Amazon will sell it, right next store to Stephen King’s latest.
If you want to design a car or create a perfume or access a law library, same deal.
And if you want a blog, you can have the very same tools that the most popular bloggers have… for free.
The tools keep getting better and better.
Which means that the first barrier to entry–access to professional tools–is gone.
So there’smore,but is therebetter?
I think we gave a Disney movie, circa 1954, the benefit of the doubt. It was the movie in the theatre. It was the only one to choose from. It was a big deal. It didn’t matter if it was the best movie Walt ever made, because it was the only one right now.

Remember Felix?,"(marketing makes it critic proof).
TheNew York Timesroasted the Odd Couple today. They hated it.
The Odd Couple booked $21 million in advance tickets. A record. The whole run is sold out.
The review, then, doesn’t matter.
But of course it does. It does for the two reasons that it sold so many tickets.
1. American Express offered advance seats to Gold Card members. Thispermission asset is hugely profitable. American Express has permissionto market to this group, a group that responds to Broadway show offersin a big way. Not only does that help sell tickets, but it makes itmore likely that members will keep paying money for their Gold Card.
2. Nathan and Matthew have a brilliant reputation. A brand, even. Asa result, when the offer showed up (TV show! Jack Klugman! The guysfrom the producers! Neil Simon! Advance tickets!) the offer wasirresistible. We’re talking $1000 scalpers on eBay.
So, there’s zero short term economic impact from a bad review.
But if it’s a bad play, all sorts of brands get tarnished. Thepermission asset decreases in value. The names aren’t worth as much.
The lesson is that the new marketing makes it a lot easier to makeproducts for your customers (instead of having to run around findingcustomers for your products.) The obligation that comes with that,though, is to make something really and truly great. You no longer haveto dumb stuff down to create average stuff for average people. You canmake something truly great. So do it.","October 28, 2005","Marketing, Reputation, Broadway"
Swan song?,"My first reaction toDelta to Eliminate Discount Carrier Songwas, ""of course it failed."" It failed because they didn’t burn their bridges, didn’t really commit, didn’t do anything but a pale imitation of Jet Blue.
But then I realized that Song wasn’t a failure on at least one level… it allowed a stodgy brown company to move fairly quickly and to discover the power of story telling. Everything from the organic food to the paint job was about telling passengers a different story. Song had trouble keeping that promise, but at least they tried.

Opening the microlending system,"Soni Pitts points us toKiva. The idea seems to be that anyone can be a microlender… Instead of spending $25 on lattes, you can help a farmer in Bangladesh buy a bull… and then he pays you back.
This is one of a number of cool ways to do first world wealth transfer. The challenge, as always, is in the execution. There’s not a huge shortage of money for microlending operations–there’s a shortage of great banks, great people to run those banks and access to the right sort of people to make the loans to.
It’s easy to imagine that every culture is as crisp as ours when it comes to money. (and hey, we’re not even that good at it… just look at credit card debt for an example). Most of the challenge of microbanking is in changing social systems, not in moving the $25.

Are you tired? Busy?,"Probably not as busy (or as tired) as our hero Tom.
He’s done an astounding number of lectures in a ridiculous number of countries over the last two months. 76,000 miles so far (he’s not very good at doing these gigs in the right geographical progression.)
So, congrats to Tom for spreading the word, and here’s a lesson worth hearing. (From:tompeters!):
So I’ve been consciously working on a new (for me) approach, with at least a smidgeon of success. Either at day’s end or dawn’s early light, I have a little meditation and self-counseling session on making the day count, rather than devoting the day to eager anticipation of the moment I can cross it off the calendar. Professionally, that first means looking anew and in depth at the forthcoming lecture to be sure that it clearly encompasses (as best I can) an ennobling purpose, challenges participants’ minds and engages their souls. (Will it at least aspire to the JFK idea that no speechifier should utter a word unless she ""aims to change the world""?) Also professionally, I ""work on"" my attitude.This may be day 45 and mile 76,000 for me, but for the Client it is D-Day for an Important Event (often their year’s #1 event, for God’s sake); hence my exhaustion and accompanying short temper must be thrust aside … and downright cheeriness and spirited engagement must become the invariant orders of the day. Besides, such cheeriness, even if feigned, cheers me up first and foremost! Next, and in a way most important, even though I have little trouble infusing my lecture with meaning, I must thoroughly convince myself that this is a day every hour of which is worth savoring! Hackneyed though it is to write, 25 October 2005 ain’t gonna come around again and this 62-year-old is gonna be a day older and closer to checkout time when it’s done.
Whatever you’re making, designing, shipping or selling, it’s a Big Event for the person buying it and using it. It may be just another car/contract/widget to you, but someone is counting on it being remarkable.","October 25, 2005","Tom Peters, mindfulness, professional engagement"

Ben’s insight,"Ben Stein wonders (link), in today’sTimes,why Yale University keeps asking him for money (and why he gives it to them.) Last year, Yale earned about $3 billion on their endowment doing deals that you and I could never do. In the face of that sort of return, do the $3,000 alumni checks really matter?
Michael Motta answered that question for me when he quoted Ben Franklin in an email today. ""he that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another, than whom you yourself have obliged"".
In other words, Yale wants Ben Stein’s money so that Ben will be inclined to do the things that Yalereallywants: send over great students, hire graduates, talk up the school and maintain its place in the pantheon of liberal arts colleges. And donors are far more likely to do that than disconnected alum.

On Mediocrity,"Why settle?
It’s not expensive to make a world-class roll. There are only a few ingredients, the recipe is straightforward (but not easy) and the ingredients don’t cost a penny extra.
Mediocre rolls are easier and more predictable. Once you figure out how to make a mediocre, tasteless, soggy roll, you can do it over and over again. Mediocre rolls can be baked by anyone, with very little care. And no one would ever go out of their way to purchase or consume a mediocre roll.
So why do we settle? Why bother being in the food business if you’re going to serve something you can’t possibly be proud of? Is making that extra dollar so important that all pride goes out the window?
Part of the curse of Wall Street is that enough is never enough. So short-term thinking sets in. Too many companies believe their owners (the stockholders) would rather have them make shlock and alienate customers to turn a little extra profit–even though it’s clear that this strategy virtually always leads to doom.
The real story here, though, has nothing to do with the stock market. It has to do with our willingness to settle for work product that just isn’t that good–at the same time we vote with our dollars to buy things and experiences that are exceptional.","October 20, 2005","Mediocrity, Excellence, Pride"
Peace of mind,"Today’s Globe & Mail reports that over the last 12 years, the number of armed conflicts in the world has gone down by 40% and the number of extremely deadly conflicts (more than 1,000 battle-related deaths) is down by more than 80%.
A different source reports that New York is the safest large city in the US, with serious crime continuing to drop.
And it’s much harder to get sick from bad sushi, too. (has to do with aggressive refrigeration.)
So, what’s going on? Why is everyone so tense?
The internet doesn’t help. Today, bad news anywhere in the world shows up in your browser in seconds. Second, there are people making a full time living (and increasing their power) by scaring us (and not just on Halloween). And lastly, it’s human nature. Vivid images have more impact on us than cold statistics. If I had accompanied this post with a picture of someone in a gutter, the 80% decrease in serious wars over a decade would quickly be forgotten.

The proximity effect,"Imagine a book publisher being upset because her company’s books were being shelved right next to competitive books on the same topic…
In fact, books sell far better at bookstores than they do at trade shows or supermarkets or pubs. That’s not news to you, I hope.
What about blogs? Blogs are far more read now than they were a few years ago when there were just a few blogs to choose from. And people visiting technorati are far more likely to read and discover a blog than someone who stumbles onto a blog link on, say, eBay.
And tuna? Tuna sells best in the fish store, lying next to the other, lesser fish, on ice.
Too often we’re beaten down by comparison shoppers and companies issuing RFPs and commodity buyers who won’t take the time to hear our story. Too often, frustrated marketers believe that they’d do better if they just didn’t have any competition.
In fact, the proximity effect can work in your favor. It usually does if your product or service is special. The proximity effect gives the consumer confidence. It creates a category where no category existed before.It lets you sell the difference, as opposed to the whole thing.
At a bar, you don’t have to sell vodka. You should have to sell why your vodka tells a better story than the other guy’s vodka.
Online, this effect is profound. Search engines add value when they present a collection of choices… because your proximity to the ""competition"" for your reader’s attention benefits both of you.","October 17, 2005","Proximity Effect, Competition, Consumer Confidence"

Someone is selling it on eBay. (Not any more, I bought it for $5). This guy buys old magazines and sells them online, one page at a time!

The new rules of naming,"For a long time, I didn’t like my name. I spent more than 30 years spelling both my first and last name in school and on the phone. It didn’t help that I had a little trouble with my S’s when I was a kid.
Of course, now I think it’s fantastic that my grandfather overruled my mom when she wanted to name me Scott. (I think he had an issue with the branding of a type of toilet paper, but that’s a different story).
Scott’s a tough name in the Google world. Mark is even tougher. Michael is probably toughest of all.
We went through a lot of hoops in naming Squidoo.I realized as I was explaining the process to a friend the other day that the same logic applies toanyproduct or service or company in our bottom-up world, so here goes:
A long time ago, the goal of a name was to capture the essence of your positioning. To deliver a USP, so you could establish supremacy in your space just with your name. International Business Machines and Shredded Wheat were good efforts at this approach.
It quickly became clear, though, that descriptive names were too generic, so the goal was to coin a defensible word that could acquire secondary meaning and that you could own for the ages. That’s why “Jet Blue” is a much better name than “Southwest” and why “Starbucks” is so much better than “Dunkin Donuts”.
“Naming companies” flourished, charging clients hundreds of thousands of dollars to coin made up words like Altria.
Then domains came along. Suddenly, people were charging (I’m not making this up), $300,000 forgoggles.com.The idea was that if you could grab a domain name (there’s only one goggles.com in the entire world), then people could easily find you.
I think many of these rules have changed, largely because of the way people use Google.
If you want Jet Blue or ikea or some other brand, you’re just as likely to type the brand into google as you are to guess the domain name. In essence, we’ve actually added a step in the process of finding someone online. (How else would anyone find Del.ico.us?)
This means that having the perfect domain name is nice, but it’s WAY more important to have a name that works in technorati and yahoo and google when someone is seeking you out.
Sort of a built-in SEO strategy.
Flickr is a good name. So is 37signals. The design firm Number 17, however, is not. Answers, About, Hotels and Business are all fine URLs, but they don’t work very well if someone forgets to put the <dot com> part in. Do a Yahoo search on radar and you won’t find the magazine or the website in the making, and do a search on simple and you won’t end up at the very expensive simple.com domain.
If you’re trying to make your way as a blogger, calling yourself Doc or Scoble or Seth is a much simpler way to establish a platform than calling your blog “Mike’s Blog”.
Sound obvious? Of course it does. But books still get titles like “Chip Kidd, Work: 1986-2006, Book One”.
So, that was the first task. Find a name that came up with close to zero Google matches. The only English language matches I found for Squidoo were for a style of fishing lure (we bought 6 gross, more on that later).
If I had a choice between a killer domain with a generic word in it or a great word that led to a less than perfect domain, I’d take thefirst,second every time.
The second thing that’s happening with the explosion of made-up unique names is that the very structure of the word now communicates meaning. Web 2.0 names often have missing (or extra) vowels. The “oo” double o is a great way to communicate a certain something about a net company.
“HRKom” doesn’t sound like the same kind of company as, say, “Jeteye”. This is all very irrational, artsy fartsy stuff, and it’s also important.
Altria and Achieva and Factiva and Kalera all sound like companies invented by naming firms. Which is a fine signal to send to Wall Street, but nothing you’d want to name your kid or your web 2.0 company.
The shift, then, is from what the words mean to what the words remind you of. The structure of the words, the way they sound, the memes they recall… all go into making a great name. Starbucks is made of two words that have nothing at all to do with coffee (except for their profits!) and the reference to Moby Dick is tenuous for most of us. But over time, the shape of the letters, the way they sound and the unique quality of the word makes it close to perfect.
So, using the [Update 2019, no longer fantastic, hard to recommend]fantasticNameBoy service (also a great name), I found thousands of available domains that managed to sound right and were unique. It took more than a month. Along the way, I almost bought FishEye.com but the owner (who has a charter boat in the Cayman Islands) wasn’t budging.
The last thing to tell you is this: you need to sell a name internally. There are two things you should keep in mind:1. don’t use a placeholder name. People will fall in love with it. Find your name, use that name and that’s it.2. don’t listen to what your friends and neighbors and colleagues tell you about a name. We had a placeholder name (yikes), I had to change it and everyone hated the new name. For weeks! Now, it feels like it couldn’t be anything else.
The entire point of “secondary meaning” is that the first meaning doesn’t matter at all (especially since you picked a name with no meaning to begin with). Over time, a surprisingly short time, your unique word, especially if it sounds right, will soon be the one and only word.",,"Naming, Branding, SEO"

This is an ebook about getting more by presenting less.
Here’s my short take on what you’ll find in the ebook:
“Fora long time, the web has been about more. More links, more traffic,more hits, more choices. In the face of all that more, many sites (andmost surfers) are not getting what they want. This free ebook proposes adifferent way of achieving your goals: less.”

I’m excited enough about this idea that I’ve spent the last 5 months assembling a team that is building a platform calledSquidoo. My goals? To raise a lot of money for the charities of your choice (or for you) at the same time we make it easier for you to spread your ideas. And to do both of those things while making it easier for people to find what they’re looking for online.

Ithink I’d describe this book as a collection of the very best blogposts from the very best authors on business. Pithy, inspiring and fun.",,"Big Moo, book review, business authors"
Abundance and the TBR,"If you’ve got a pretty good job (and I assume you do) that probably means that you get to do a fair amount of self-management. If you’re installing eyelets at a Nike factory, they measure your output to the tenth of a second. I’m not talking about that. I’m writing this for people who are given the freedom to solve problems or create opportunities at work.
Like most things, there’s a spectrum of approaches. In this case, I think the two ends of the spectrum are an approach ofAbundanceand an approach I callTechnically Beyond Reproach(TBR).
Abundance means that you look at every problem spec and figure out how to make it bigger.TBR tries to make it smaller.
Abundance means that you spend a lot of time imagining how you will overdeliver.TBR means you start from the beginning making sure that the work you do will either meet spec or you’ll have a really good excuse.
Entrepeneurs have a hard time with the TBR approach, because it has never ever worked for them. VCs and customers and competitors give few bonus points for excuses, even really good ones, so the only approach that wins is the abundance one.
An abundant-approach employee shows up early so she won’t need the ""train was late"" excuse on the day of the presentation. The TBR employee gets a note from the Metro. (true story).
An abundant-approach minister grows his church from 200 families to 3,000 by constantly reinventing what he does all day. A TBR minister does a very good job of consoling the sick and writing sermons.
Is there somethingwrongwith the TBR approach? It depends what you want. If you want to grow, TBR won’t get you there. (ThePurple Cowwas not about being garish or outlandish. It was, I know realize, about thinking abundantly). Yes, I probably want my airline pilot to be TBR, at least most of the time. But no, not the chef at the restaurant.
There are whole industries built around TBR thinking. The weddingbusinessfor example, charges extra so the bride and her mom will be blameless. The ""top"" colleges offer an expensive degree that is also beyond reproach, ""Hey, it’s not my fault… I paid my dues, went to a great school…""
The fascinating thing about the transparency of the Net is that it makes it easy to measure the differences between the two approaches. There are a bazillion blogs, andtechnoratimakes it easy to see which ones have popped. And those are? Those are the ones that didn’t follow the blogging manual, that didn’t diligently do what they were supposed to do, but instead, they were run with an abundance mindset. The blogger chose to answer a bigger question, in a bigger way.
I think what it comes down to is the first question you ask yourself when you see an opportunity or a challenge.
Is it, ""How can I make this bigger, do it faster and change the outcome for all of us?""or is it""If this doesn’t work, will I get in trouble or will I be okay?""","October 6, 2005","Abundance, TBR, mindset"

Being purple with variety,"""Six kinds of cereal isn’t enough?""
I can hear your grandmother now.
Of course it’s enough. Six varieties of cereal is more than enough to cover our breakfast needs.
But what about our wants? Our fancy? Our desire to be overwhelmed with specialness?
Here’s a hotel, working hard to turn the most profitable meal of the day (breakfast, by a longshot) into something even more profitable.
They get pretty good turnover. The cereal is sealed. So why offer only six choices as part of the $17 ""buffet""? Why offer just one kind of tea? One kind of bread that you toast yourself?
The cost of offering 40 kinds of cereal is close to zero. The cost to offering 100 kinds of tea is about the same. No, we don’tneedit, but we don’t need to eat in the hotel either. And yes, you’d be sure to tell people about it. ""Hey, you know what I had for breakfast? A mixture of Cap’n Crunch, Quisp (who knew they even made Quisp any more! and Honeycomb!! And I had it with chocolate soymilk and M & Ms on top.""
You get to be a kid again for less than twenty bucks.
Of course, once everyone starts using variety as a tool to be remarkable, it won’t be remarkable any more. But for now, and for a while to come, buy more cereal.","October 3, 2005","variety, breakfast, cereal"

Welcome to the hobby economy,"Economists don’t know what to do about it.
It’s hard to measure, hard to quantify and a little odd to explain.More and more people are spending more and more time (and money) on pursuits that have no pay off other than satisfaction.
""Why should you have a blog?"" they ask. ""How are you going to make any money?""
""Why post your photos onflickr?""they wonder. ""You don’t get compensated by people who see them."" Or your garage band’s songs on an MP3 site. Or spending time and money on projects like:The Basket Book: Over 30 Magnificent Baskets To Make and Enjoy.
Of course, economists don’treallyworry about this. They understand perfectly well that economics is able to easily explain that human beings pursue things that satsify them.
What the web is doing, though, is exposing lots of avenues for people to use to find satisfaction (but not necessarily cash).Makemagazine is page after page of geek projects that are fun, but not profitable. Other sites make it easy for you to build atube amplifierorsplice your own DNA.
Now that white-collar workers regularly spend 75 hours a week at work (did you know the CEO of GE has been spending more than 100 hours a week–for twenty years?!) there’s plenty of time to surf the web and get paid for it.","November 30, 2005","hobby economy, satisfaction, web projects"
Human battering rams,"Yesterday I was cold-called by a telemarketer from the (formerly) prestigious Roundabout Theatre Company.

Great Marketers are Architects,"A friend sent me this note yesterday:
Seth,happy holidays  to you and familyAfter much thought  I want to go after a senior marketingperson ,Obviously  you might know of someone. any thoughts? if youdo send my way . salary plus percentage of increase in biz and new bizdevelopment.
I wrote back:
…you need to be clear with yourself about what ""senior"" means and what""marketing"" means.
Do you mean a commission based salesperson who pretends to be amarketer? Do you mean a CMO who comes from ESPN or JetBlue? Or do youmean an advertising person?
You won’t get what you want unless you know what you want.
And his response:
Agreed . But I am sure. A strict marketer who can take the existing biza maximize both ends and find new revenue streams.
Of course, this isn’t going to work. It’s not going to work because  ""take the existing biz and maximize"" is the job for a direct marketer, or an ad guy, not an architect.
What does an architect do? She reinvents the very nature of what’s delivered and how it is delivered. She reimagines the inputs and outputs of the organization, as well as its story, to create an engine of revenue that grows while benefitting all sides.
The reason we hear about google and apple and jetblue and starbucks all the time is that these are poster children for re-architecting existing business models into something very different. The marketing is not slapped on. Starbucks is not Dunkin Donuts with a clever sign. If Dunkin Donuts goes out to hire a ""senior marketer"" and gives that person traditional senior marketer duties, not much is going to change.
I thought of this when I saw my friend Lisa’s thriving non-profit,Dos Margaritas.The website isn’t the snappy page you’d imagine if you wanted a ""senior marketer"" to build you something that would spread the word and increase donations. But the business itself, what they do and the way they do it–that’s brilliant marketing architecture.",,"Marketing Architecture, Senior Marketer, Business Model"

And if you’re a gourmet, you probably want to make more than one at a time, and you still don’t want to clean it.
Not only don’t people need it, it’s unclear that they even want it.
It seems as though we’ve marketed ourselves into a corner, where the only way to grow is to find increasingly narrow niches of decreasing utility. The consumer portion of our economy is now dependent on a four-week long debt-fueled race to buy the useless.

Can more than 50% be wrong?,"12,000 people have taken ablind taste test. You do a search you’re familiar with, it shows you the results from Google, MSN and Yahoo. Which is the most relevant, it asks?
Almost 60% of those tested said thatYahoo or MSNwas the most relevant.
Which reinforces my point that Google isn’t ""better"" for most people if ""better"" means more relevant or deeper. Google is better because itfeelsbetter and quicker and leaner and easier to use. The story we tell ourselves about Google is very different, and we use it differently as a result. Think about that the next time you insist you need a ""better"" formula or a faster server or a stronger first baseman.

No good home pages?,"We’re deep into a discussion ofSquidoo’shome page, and it occured to me that except for the exception that proves the rule(Google),there are no good home pages.
Certainly not Amazon or eBay or even Yahoo. Not MSN or AOL or Technorati, either. Go look at these pages through the eyes of a newbie, or of a power user or of someone who stumbled over without knowing exactly why. Do they succeed?
Home pages try to do too much. They try to explain to the unitiated, retrain the veterans, and get out of the way of the power users.
It’s a little like book covers, actually. Book covers generally fail to sell a book. What they do if they succeed is they get you to pick the book up, and to pick it up in the right sort of mood.

On pricing,"Twenty years ago, I participated in some pricing meetings on my new line of computer games. In the room were two Stanford MBAs, two Harvard MBAs and someone from Kellogg, I think. How did we decide between $24.95, $29.95 or $34.95?
We flipped a coin.
But we were scientific about it. A single elimination ladder, best of three.
Pricing has always been a combination of economics and marketing and luck. My hero Joel Spolsky (best engineer who knows how to write) has a piece on this atJoel on Software.
The thing is, I disagree with him.
Pricing is a very effective signaling device, no doubt about it. People (and businesses) assume that good stuff is worth more. People pay for stuff on eBay for stuff based on the velocity of the auction instead of the innate value of the item. Real estate brokers warn you that a house that doesn’t sell right away is hard to sell because people look at a house that’s been on the market for a few months differently. All irrational and all based on signaling.
The reason that lousy movies cost the same as blockbuster movies, though, doesn’t have to do with signalling. (the fear is that people won’t go to cheap movies because the cheap price will tell them it is a lousy movie). Of course, this isn’t what happens with DVD sales. They sell plenty of really cheap DVDs that you never heard of… for a lot less than the new Star Wars Movie. No, the pricing of movies has to do with industry traditions and being stuck. It’s just too hard to get everything in alignment and for all the players to say okay.
Which leads to the current debate over how much Apple should charge for iTunes. 99 cents a song is a great signal. It tells the purchaser that this is somehow ""fair.""
The record companies want to charge MORE for hot hits, though. The thing is, this will mean raising the average price, because for every song they sell for $2, don’t expect a lot of songs to cost five cents.
Which leads us to the wisdom of Jeff Bezos. There are two kinds of companies, Jeff says. Companies that work to lower prices (like Amazon, most of the time) and companies that work to raise prices (like the music industry, all of the time).","November 19, 2005","Pricing, Signaling, Economics"

If you’re in any business where the cost to enter as a competitor is very low, you’ve got this problem. The minute there are big profits being made, competitors will flood in and steal them. This is why there are five times as many real estate brokers in San Francisco as inSteubenville,Ohio. Because the houses cost five times as much, the commissions are five times as great, so brokers show up in enough volume that everyone goes back to making exactly the same amount of money.

How to Run a Useless Conference,"I go to more conferences than you do.
I’m frequently amazed, but not particularly surprised, at what a bad job conferences do at their stated objective. What’s the problem? After all, these are expensive, professionally-run events that work hard to satisfy the typical attendee.
And that, of course, is the problem.
Facts don’t change people’s behavior.
Emotion changes people’s behavior.
Stories and irrational impulses are what change behavior. Not facts or bullet points.
If all we need is facts, then books alone would be sufficient.
When the Surgeon General announced that smoking was fatal, how many smokers quit right away?
Human beings are irrational. Change agents (like you) can fight that and obsess about presenting more and more facts, or we can embrace it and make change happen.
Conferences are designed to get average people to change their behavior. By “average”, I mean typical—the masses, the center of thebell curve. That’s a sensible objective. By definition, most people (in any given population) are in the middle of that bell curve. Change them and you’re golden.If this group would learn, take action and make things happen with just a memo, you wouldn’t need to have a conference. But we end up being flown on average planes to average hotels to sit in average conference rooms and hear average speakers doing presentations filled with bullet points. And it’s all beyond reproach.
But it doesn’t work.
It doesn’t work when you’re on a sales call either. Your facts and your service and your prices can be the best, but that doesn’t mean you’ll get the sale. And it breaks down at an annual review and it even happens in a one-on-one encounter with a policeman or a teacher or a clerk.
People are irrational and they usually make decisions that have nothing to do with facts. And yet we spend most of our time improving our facts and very little concerned with the rest.Think about the most powerful learning moments you’ve ever had. My guess is that they didn’t take place in a darkened meeting room.
Conference organizers (and more important, their clients) spend virtually all of their time and money doing one of two things:1.    Satisfying the center of the bell curve.2.    Avoiding failure
That’s why the typical conference is… typical.
That’s why the food and the setting and the venue and the location and the chairs and the layout and the schedule and the refreshment breaks are… typical.
If you want to run a meeting (a brainstorming meeting, a board meeting, a zoning commission meeting) that is likely to perform as well as your past meetings, then the best thing to do is to run it the way you’ve always been running it, right?
Here’s the challenge, then: figure out how to do the atypical. How to change the interactions that people have with each other. How to change what they talk about in the elevator. How to create an environment where people walk in ready to learn and change and challenge, as opposed to getting that, “hey we’re in the Bahamas let’s get drunk and then sit through a session with the CEO” glazed look.
Sure, it won’t work on everyone. But that’s better than working on no one.","November 13, 2005","Conference Dynamics, Behavior Change, Emotional Engagement"

How the New Marketing changes Local Max,"My earlierposton the Local Max really hit a chord, which I figured it would, because it woke me up in the middle of the night…
The obvious question, after you’ve had the conversation with your team about B, C and the pain of getting to Big Max is this, ""How do we get to work to find the really big thing?""
The good news is that the new marketing makes it easier than ever before.
The cost of inventing, prototyping, manufacturing and especially advertising a new thing, concept, service or organization is a tiny fraction of what it used to be. In some industries, you can do it for 1% of what it used to cost.
Sooner or later, your team needs to embrace this fact.
What this means is simple… you can take the cash and the momentum you get from being at Local Max and invest a fraction of it to let a new team, a smaller team, a team without traditional constraints to go ahead and launch something new. Something that disrupts the market, that even competes with the mother ship.
And if it’s your career we’re talking about, the same thing is true. You don’t have to get a formal MBA or quit your job to start a profitable business or sideline. You can leverage the amazing tools that exist without having to wager everything.
There are two mistakes that satisfied Local Max folks make:1. believing that they can get to the next Max in a linear, pain-free wayand2. believing that the best way to get there is with brute force. More products more salespeople more ads more buildings more staff…
In fact, the opposite is true.
The more you help your little team, the harder it will be for them to find the new Max.
The bet isn’t the scary one that involves all your money or your full-time job. The bet is the scary one that involves intellectual risks and going way outside your safety zone to see what happens when you disrupt the status quo.","November 10, 2005","New Marketing, Local Max, Disruption"
Lost Boots and the whole hog,"""…maybe it was going to be my responsibility to keep upping the ante. I was in an automobile accident in 1960 with three other guys…All I know is that I was sitting in the car… and the next thing, I was in a field, far enough away from the car that I couldn’t see it. The car was crumpled like a cigarette pack… and inside it were my shoes. I’d been thrown completely out of my shoes and through the windshield.
""…I had the feeling that my life had been spared to do something… not to take any bullshit, to either go whole hog or not at all. Before that, I had been living at less than capacity. That event was the slingshot for the rest of my life. It was my second chance, and I got serious.""

Understanding Local Max,"My guess is that you’ve been wrestling with your Local Max.
If your organization or even your career is stuck, it may just be because of this chart.
Everyone starts at that dot at the bottom left corner. You’re not succeeding because you haven’t started yet.
Then you try something. If it works, you end up at pointA.
Ais where you see results as the direct output of a strategy and hard work.Ais the job you got after investing in an MBA.Ais the sales you got after running an ad.
Of course, being a success-oriented capitalist, that’s not enough. So you do more. You push and hone and optimize until you end up at the Local Max. The Local Max is where your efforts really pay off.
So you try harder. And you end up at pointB. PointBis a bummer. PointBis backwards. Point B is where the outcome of more effort against your strategy doesn’t return better results. So you retreat. You go back to your Local Max.
And that is where most people stay. Most people get stuck at the Local Max because changing strategy in any direction (this is really a 3D chart, but I’ve smushed it to make it easier) leads to poorer results.
You’ve got a very good job as an art director. To do better, you’d either have to move to another firm, move to another town, switch careers or go back to school. And all of them have costs and very uncertain returns, so you stay.
You have 100 competitors in an industry that is self-described as a commodity. You use the same tactics your competition does, because if you change your pricing or fundamentally alter your marketing outreach, you get punished in terms of sales or profits.
You’ve got summer camp with 80 kids in it. If you want to grow, you’ve learned the hard way that hiring one or two more senior staff people won’t work, because you can’t afford them. So you stick with what you’ve got.
The lie of Local Max is this:the chart is incomplete.It really looks like this:

Local Max isn’t actually that great when you realize that Big Max is not particularly far away.
The problem is that to get to Big Max, you need to go through stepC, which is a horrible and scary place to be.
There were 10,000 single-location hamburger restaurants in the world when Ray Kroc decided to build a giant chain of franchised McDonald’s. Anyone could have done it. No one did. Because everyone who tried had to go through pointCto get there. It took Colonel Sanders more than a decade of pain to get through point C.
Of course, it’s not just about growing sales or revenues. The Big Max/Local Max paradox affects everything from education to non-profits to politicians. If you have a ""Max"", whatever you’re measuring, the odds are you’re actually dealing with a Local Max, not the Big one.
If your market is changing, this idea is even more important to understand. That’s because changing markets are always surfacing new Big Max points, and the only way to get to them is to go through the pain (yes, it’s painful) of pointC.
You can’t reinvent yourself and your organization until you deal with the fear of pointC, and that’s hard to do without talking about it. I think the benefit of the Local Max curve is that it makes it easy for you and your team to have the conversation.","November 9, 2005","Local Max, Big Max, strategy"

Worth noting that you don’t have $60,000,000.
Also worth noting that his opponent, Freddy Ferrer, will spend seven million dollars. To lose. By a lot.
Yes, it helps that Bloomberg is turning out to be a great mayor, far better than his predecessor. But it’s also clear that having 6x time the money and the advantage of a bigger and better brand makes it impossible for a challenger to use thesame media toolsto catch up.
Most brands, most products, most candidates–are Freddy, not Mike. If you intend to grow and gain share, your seven million dollars isn’t going to help a bit if you spend it on a medium that rewards the market leader.
As an aside, it’s worth noting that virtually all political marketers agree that TV ads work when they get the opponent’s supporters to stay home… that it’s way easier to market acceptance and laziness than it is to market action and change.

Authenticity and Pedro,"
Napoleon Dynamite is a sleeper hit, a cult classic among teens. One of the most memorable images in the film is the shot of the ""vote for pedro"" t-shirt.
So, it was no surprise at all when it became almost omnipresent. It’s all over the web. The shirt is supposed to look homemade, so it’s easy to make.
Now, explain to me why the officially licensed ""costume"" comes with the shirt to the right? A shirt that DOESN’T look homemade, that’s silkscreened and extra fancy, with a bonus quote on it, thus making it a souvenir, not a costume…
I think the reason is that the mass market doesn’t always crave authenticity. Yes, the Star Wars geek wants a light sabre that’s the same. But the buyer at Toys R Us wants one that’s a little different, a little cheesier…
Years ago at Epcot Center, I overheard one tourist say to another, ""This is great. Now we don’t need to go to Spain!""

Monetize this,"I wonder how I can make some money off my friends?
I wonder how I can turn my blog into a profit center?
I wonder if I can get some of the kids at the playground to make me some money?
Americans love to monetize stuff. Why bother doing something if you’re not going to make a profit at it?
Tom Asackerhas a noteworthy riff (which I want to disagree with–at least a little) about the ""how much is my blog worth"" button that’s traveling around (I stole this one from him, and he got it fromEvelyn).I have no idea how much my blog is worth. I also don’t try to monetize my blog–that would ruin it. It would ruin it because most of my readers would leave, and it would ruin it because then I’d try to outdo myself and monetize it more and more and more.
Evelyn Rodriguez and other popular bloggers certainly agree with me. The George Washington icon is a joke–a reminder that the goal is not to turn around and sell our blogs to the highest bidder, but instead to enjoy the process of having people we respect hear what we have to say.
Do the people you work with assume that something has to turn a profit to be good?
It’s absurd to imagine someone trying very hard to monetize their desire to scuba dive once a week or write poetry or hang out with friends. People like to talk about their favorite sports teams or tech gadgets, but why do we have to be in such a hurry to turn that into a profit? And why is ""just a hobby"" a pejorative remark?
Isn’t the point of all the difficult work we do to earn the right to do things we enjoy?
One blog I used to read is now filled with nothing but aggressive links to buy more books and read more glowing reviews of the work of the blogger. How sad that the quest for cashing out turned something great into something to be avoided.
Is the web (or the blogosphere) off limits to making a profit? No way! It’s one of the greatest money-makin/marketing mechanisms ever. But the irony is that those that have set out to quickly turn a profit have almost always failed.
Saul Hansell’s pieceon Google on Sunday buried the lead. The real revolution at Google is the way they sell their ads–something that both Sergey and Larry were against when it was first conceived. Not only wasn’t it their idea, but Eric tried to kill the innovation that completely overhauled the web. Google works for two reasons. First, because it’s great to use. Andthen,second (the ""then"" being important here) because they invented a brand new way to turn attention into revenue… a method that rewards the intelligence of the user without penalizing her.
Maybe Google should put up a statue in honor of Salar Kamangar, the guy who figured it out.
So…–yes, you have a brand, even if you don’t intend to monetize it.
–no, you don’t have to have a plan or an ulterior motive if you want to share your ideas. Just share them. It’s good practice and good for all of us.

Wal-Mart is hiringtop political consultants with track records from the Reagan and Clinton  campaigns to coordinate a multimillion effort to discredit anew filmabout the company. Wal-Mart is entitled to be as anti-union as they like, of course, and entitled to work hard to get the word out about their point of view, but it’s surprising (at least to me) to see who is willing to help them combat those that would critize them.
Strange bedfellows, it seems.
Politicians (and especially political consultants) are a special breed. One day they crow about how something is essential (""give em an up or down vote!"") and the very next day they take the other side.
But are they really a special breed?
Have you ever worked on a product or service you didn’t believe in? Marketed something with side effects (okay, there are no side effects, just effects) that you weren’t proud of? (To be fair, there are Kerry and Dean alum working just as hard on the other side…)
For a really long time, the discourse in the public space was assumed to be genuine. We assumed that if someone took a position, they actually believed it. (Of course, that was never true, but we liked to believe that it was). Today, as money further corrupts just about all of the systems we used to assume were pristine, it’s getting harder to make that assumption with any validity.
Where do you draw the line? How much money does it take to change your mind? What happens when we expose the data and label opinions or efforts as purchased?
The ideas that are being spread most often today aren’t ideas at all. They’re opinions. And we learned a long time ago that everyone is entitled to his opinion. But what if it’s not his opinion? What if the opinion belongs to someone else?

A million dollars here…,"a million dollars there, pretty soon, it all adds up.
In 1997, Lisa Gansky (at GNN) and I (at Yoyodyne) put together the first million dollar giveaway on the Net. If I remember right, the hard work our teams put into it led to a annuity (probably still paying off) for a forklift operator who really needed the money.
That was eight years ago. It was a breakthrough gimmick because until then, the biggest prize ever given online was perhaps $50,000.
Over the last few weeks, the mail I have been getting the most often is about million dollar websites, RSS feeds and other advertising gimmicks that revolve around selling little bits of data to advertisers as a way of gaming the games of attention and search engines and traffic.
It seems like a million dollars is still a lot of money.
The problem with the Pet Rock is that you could only do it once. Sure, it sold a bazillion rocks, but what good did that do everyone else? It’s really easy to waste a lot of time chasing gimmicks, always arriving just a little too late to be the guy who breaks through.
The first million-dollar website, apparently, did awfully well. But who would be interested in the second one?

"Squid soup, part I: The Myth of the Product Adoption Lifecycle","One of the most important ideas in business writing is certainly Geoff Moore’sCrossing the Chasm. In it, he talks about the bell curve that indicates how any population will respond to a new technology.(Espen Andersen points out that the real source is theDiffusion of Innovations, by Rogers. My apologies to Everett).
The little green tail on the left represent the few, the brave, the innovators. These are the geeks and the nerds that love new stuff. The black segment next to it are the early adopters (not adapters, that means something else) that embrace new ideas that help them do the rest of their lives more productively. The next group picks up new ideas a little more slowly (these are the folks who bought an iPod last year) and the next group completes the mass market (these are the ones that will buy an iPod next year). The last group are the laggards and they still have a record player.
One of the giant insights of the new marketing is that the only way to introduce a new idea is to move across the curve. Sell to the little tail, they tell the next group, which passes the word on to the mass market. That’s why the little tiny green tail is so valuable… these are the people who are listening, these are the people who will become your marketing force.
So, where’s the myth?
The myth is that marketers think these people actually care.
People don’t care, certainly not about marketers.
The vast majority of new products never show up anywhere on this curve. A new restaurant opens in Manhattan and the foodies don’t materialize. A new consulting practice, based on a challenging and proven idea, opens up but leading edge companies never become clients. A fresh new face decides to run for city council but the political junkies don’t sign her petition.

"Squid soup, part II: Inertia and White food","The secret to true understanding of marketing has very little to do with permission or positioning or product development. It’s not about loyalty or conversations or blogging, either. Those are all essential ideas and tactics, but what really matters isbrown rice and squid soup.
Imagine a hotel buffet. Dozens and dozens of items (this is an Amercian buffet, where excess is the key). You can have whatever you want, as much as you want.
The cost of making a mistake at the buffet is precisely zero. There is no time cost, no opportunity cost, no social cost. Put some on your plate, if you like it, you can have more.
So, it turns out at this buffet, the two best items (where best is obviously a loaded word, and in this case best to me means best tasting and simultaneously healthiest) were the brown rice and the squid soup. The brown rice was soft, just a little bit chewy. It was like very good white rice, but with flavor and texture that went beyond white rice. It was nutty and had both texture and flavor. And the squid soup had depth. The squid (yes, the name attracted me to the soup) was as soft as an egg noodle and the broth had tomatoes but didn’t taste like Campbell’s.
You’ve already guessed the punchline. Of the hundreds of people at the buffet, very few even tried either one.
Why?
Inertia.
Thereisa cost of trying the rice and the soup. The cost is the effort necessary to consider switching. Beyond that, there’s the (tiny) fear of tasting something you won’t like or the effort involved in realigning your worldview if you do like it.
“But I don’t like squid soup,” they say. Well, how exactly do you know that? What chance is there that they’ve previously tasted squid soup and rejected it? Close to zero. But this audience, this market, has a worldview, and it includes the rule: if it’s a weird food and it’s in a soup, I don’t like it. Getting rid of that rule requires effort.
I read a survey three years ago (beware surveys like this one) that said only a third of all Americans had ever tasted a bagel. Now, the bagels that are available in most places are horrible and not bagel-like at all, but the point is that in most areas, most endeavors, most markets, most people, when given the choice, try nothing.
The problem with the bell curve is that most people, in most situations, will ignore your idea.
Football is huge on television in the US, soccer is not: inertia. The fact that General Motors sells any cars at all is related to inertia. It’s not just the middle-America mass market at work here. This explains why an entire race of people on Easter Island became extinct—once they embraced a cultural system that involved cutting down trees, it was too hard to stop, even after they could see the coming danger.
It’s always easier to do nothing (new).
Humans embrace change far more than any animal on the planet. But we’re bad at it.
Of course,you’renot bad at it. You’re always buying new stuff, reading new blogs, trying new ideas. You’re the cutting edge… (which leads to my next post).",,"Inertia, Change, Marketing"
"Squid soup, part III: The Cutting Edge?","In my last post, I riffed about how little people liked change… and referred to you, my loyal readers, as the self-elected early adopters, the radical new, the folks who embrace big new ideas.
You use Firefox, read a hundred blogs with an open-source RSS reader, have a blog, post your bookmarks with delicious, have a flickr account, you’re a digger and you have built a dozen squidoo lenses. After all, they’re all free, they teach you about valuable new ideas and they’re fun.
Except, if my numbers are accurate, that last paragraph probably isn’t true.
Delicious is a sensation, but far less than 1% of the people online (who are already in the cutting edge of the population when it comes to embracing new tech ideas) have posted their bookmarks. Firefox is demonstrably better than the built-in alternative, and they have market share of less than 20%. Too much inertia. “I’ll just use what’s built in…”
AOL users, were, by definition, the cutting edge for years. They were among the first to go online. But then millions got stuck inside AOL’s walled community, not even realizing that AOL ≠ the internet. Inertia became a critical asset for AOL. That satisfied users by giving them what they liked, not by selling them squid soup.
Web 2.0 is off to a rocket-fast start. Little companies growing superfast. But most of the readers of this blog haven’t built a lens or shared their bookmarks or uploaded their photos yet. How come? It’s fast and free and perhaps fun. The answer is pretty obvious—you’ve got other things to do. The cost of deciding to try is too high, because you can always decide later.
All the innovations that pundits like to talk about—from Jetblue to the Prius to Apple—have tiny market share compared to the attention they get or the benefits that people rave about. Because even the cutting edge isn’t in that much of a hurry.
Watch out for the 5% ruleMost new marketing ideas that are any good feel like they might be able to convert 5% of those in the market for what’s being sold.
And of course, only 5% of the population is in the market for what’s being sold.
And only 5% of those in the market are choosing to pay attention.
So it’s really 5% of 5% of 5%. Take 10,000 people. That’s 500, which gets you 25 which gets you one.
1 new customer.
5% isn’t enough. Not if you’re in a hurry!
The punchlineMarketing used to be expensive. Buy a few million dollars worth of ads and you could have a shot at success.
Marketing is now (potentially) much, much cheaper. But that doesn’t mean it’s easy. The challenge now isn’t to raise a whole bunch of money. The challenge is to invent a product or service or idea or meme that’s so compelling that the tiny green portion of the curve, the geeks in whatever market you live in, can’t ignore what you have to offer. That, and once they adopt what you’ve got, they can’t help but spread it.

Clean firetrucks,"We live in a neighborhood where all the firehouses are run by volunteers. I don’t know how we’d get by without them… they do brave work, with little credit.
One thing you’ll notice is how clean the trucks are. “Why are the trucks so clean,” a friend asked? After all, a clean firetruck isn’t a lot better at putting out fires than a smudged one.
The answer: Because when there isn’t a fire, the firemen wait for the siren to ring. And while they’re waiting, they clean the truck.
Sounds a lot like where you work. Most organizations are staffed with people waiting for the alarm to ring. Instead of going out to the community and working to prevent new fires, the mindset is that firemen are working to put out the fires that have started. Hotel desk clerks don’t write letters or make calls to generate new business—they stand at the desk waiting for business to arrive. Software engineers are often overwhelmed with an endless list of programming fires—and rarely get a chance to think about what they ought to build next.
The structure of most organizations (and every single school I’ve ever encountered!) supports this. It’s about cleaning your plate, finishing your assignments and following instructions. Initiative is hard to measure and direct and reward. Task completion, on the hand, is a factory orientation that is predictable and feels safe.

Useful fear,"In the following riff from Jarvis onBuzzMachine, just replace [the newsroom] with the name of your organization.
The first job is to instill fear in [the newsroom]. Oh, there’s fear there now. But it is fear of the unknown. What we need is fear of the known: the facts about falling readership and advertising and the reasons behind both and about new competition. Fear alone won’t lead to a strategy, of course. But until there is an imperative to change inspired by that fear, it won’t be possible to move past the complacency and resistance that populate so many newsrooms now. In later posts, we’ll look at means to replace fear with excitement about new opportunities. But first things first.",,"fear, newsrooms, strategy"
Horizontal Knowledge,"A great phrase coined by Glenn Reynolds:TCS: Tech Central Station – Horizontal Knowledge.
It’s best understood by thinking about its opposite: Vertical Knowledge. The stuff you get from the boss or the MSM or the person at the front of the room.
Whenever I go to a conference, I learn more from the people in the lobby. And the web is one big big lobby.
There’s a throwaway line in his post that I really enjoyed. Glenn riffs about the fact that there’s no way, in 1993, that anyone could have predicted the Internet of 2003. In fact, critics might say that even if we planned for it, we never could have built it. Then he says:
Actually, that final statement is true. If we had started planning in 1993, we probably wouldn’t have gotten here by now.
Planning implies vertical, top down thinking. And in many areas, it’s backfiring.",,"Horizontal Knowledge, Vertical Knowledge, Internet Evolution"
"Promotion, self-promotion and [insert ad here]","Remember the MTV astronaut?
If you ask someone about MTV in the 1980s, they might mention Adam Curry or Toni Basil or Robert Palmer, but odds are what they’re visualizing are the promo ads.
The music videos weren’t unique. They were provided by the record companies to anyone who wanted to broadcast them. The VJs were largely forgettable. But the promos–they were constant (five or ten an hour) and constantly changing. MTV created an entire gestalt (it even became the inspiration for a pop hit and avideo compilation). It turns out that welikedthe ads.
Try reading a copy of Vogue without the ads. Totally useless.
And at a trade show (which people invest huge amounts of time and money to attend), the only reason to go is to see the ads, the banners, the paid-for booths and self-promotional speakers.
Public radio is no longer a bastion of silence. Every station is filled with self-promos, often twenty an hour, along with interruptions from sponsors and of course, pledge week. And the bumpers and audio cues that the stations use become part of our experience. We miss them when they’re gone.
All as a way of introducing you to my dilemma about blogs.
In email, no one, at least no one I respect or believe, enjoys getting spam. Ads in email don’t work because email is a tool, not a medium. If I subscribe to a permission-based email campaign (like those notes from Amazon or a gift certificate on my birthday from Yahoo) then I look forward to it and respond. But ads in the sense of unanticipated, impersonal and irrelevant… not on my agenda, or yours, when it comes to email, or RSS for that matter.
But the blog experience is different. Maybe.
The most popularblogin the world carries more than25different ads on its home page. The other most popularblogin the world carries just 1. Clearly, one blog profits more than the other, but it doesn’t seem to affect readership.
And what about within the blog? One author I know featured his new book 11 times in a month where he posted on twenty five days. When I launch a newbook,it gives me a headache to mention the launch/sales of the book more than twice, unless I’m riffing on an idea. I feel like I’m imposing.
Last month, after months of working on it, my team launchedsquidoo,a web 2.0 innovation that we’re very proud of. But you’re not seeing it on my blog… except for oneinterviewlast week. Is that the right thing to do?
Thepostbelow this riff is about my new seminar, given next month. The writer part of me wants to believe that my alert, quickwitted readers only need to see it once, and that they’re mature enough to make a decision about whether they want to come or not.Of course, I’m completely wrong.I meanyouare in that esteemed category, but most people are not. Most people need to see thatlinkthree or four times a day, several times a week, and then they’ll take action. And they’ll be glad they did.
I regularly (as in every day) get email from people who boughtthisbook orthatbook or eventhisbook and are surprised that they didn’t know about it and are glad they discovered it. Does that mean that it’s my job to advertise them incessantly, regularly reminding people that they exist?
Imagining for just a moment that there’sno self-interest, no profit motive, imagining that the blogger is doing what is in the best interest of the readership–what’s the right balance? Is it one ad per page? 25? Is it no promotional links to new projects (from you or from those you respect) or is one the right number?
I thought I had figured it out. The idea was to do interesting things, announce them just once on your blog, and then use those interesting things to inform the stories you tell moving forward. When I riff about storytelling or about anticipated advertising or about viruses, I’m not doing it to sell a book. I wrote the book so I could learn about that topic, so I could start a conversation going, and then I riff about them online because I figure my readers can learn (or at least be entertained) by what I’m discovering… whether or not they buy the book. And this ""don’t buy, just learn"" approach has ended up working out for me.
But when I see how other blogs serve their readers with promotion, MTV style, I wonder… I honestly don’t have an answer for you… this is a question, not a rant. If promotion works, if it brings people stuff that they’re glad they got and it makes the experience more exciting, then what’s wrong with it?
In the same breath, I wonder whether that sort of promotion should really be necessary. I wonder whether readers will think the blogger is selfish or self-serving (when I’m sure I’m really not.) And I wonder about the future of the medium, because the nature of promotion is that ""10"" is never enough. You always need to be at ""11"". And when the competition hits 11, that becomes the new 10.
When Katrina hit, blogs broke all their rules about promotion. It was understood by readers and by bloggers that the cause was good enough that people really needed to be pushed. Do you need to be pushed?

The new whiteboard seminar (you’re invited),"It’s back.UPDATE: Seminar is SOLD OUT. Hope to do another one, but not sure when.
By popular demand, the day-longSeth Godin Whiteboard Seminaris going uptown.
Last year, I ran only four seminars (each sold out), so if you’ve been waiting, here’s your chance. No promises about when it might be offered again.
On Thursday, January 26, you’re invited to attend an all-day seminar with me in New York. It will be held in the beautiful Harold Pratt House located at 58 East 68th Street, New York, NY 10021. As you can see from the picture, this majestic brownstone is totally upscale. Most days, it’s the headquarters for one of the most prestigious thinktanks in the world.
WHO IT’S FOR:Brand managers, CEOs, entrepreneurs… Actually, anyone who’s working to spread a big idea about a product, a service, an organization, a rock group or an open-source piece of software. Anyone with a website. And especially for people frustrated with the status quo.
The seminar is about the way you market, it’s about managing people in times of change, and most important, helping great ideas spread.
In the past, senior managers from Fortune 100 companies have sat next to solo entrepreneurs and even ministers. Non-profits in a hurry to grow have benefitted, and so have long-time marketers from traditional industries. The man running one of the world’s most successful book publishing companies has participated, as did the deputy campaign manager for a nationwide presidential campaign.
Some of the people who have written me the nicest letters afterwards have been CEOs of very tiny businesses. I’ve also been privileged to watch huge companies embrace some of these ideas and run with them. One thing is certain: it will change the questions your colleagues ask, which is the point.
Bring your boss. That’s the big win.
WHAT’S COVERED:The morning is devoted to a blazingly fast, high-impact overview of several of my books. The purpose is to give you the ammunition to sell these ideas to to the people you work with.
The afternoon is nothing but riffs about your organization and your problems. By taking them one by one and talking them through, you not only get direct feedback on your issues, but you quickly see how there are only a handful of answers to just about all that ails everyone’s marketing challenges. In other words, once you hear other people work through their issues, it’s a lot easier to handle yours.
THE FORMAT:It’s interactive, but it’s very much my show. I talk a lot, push you a lot and end up exhausted in a heap at the end of the day. The more you bring with you, the more you get back. The best seminars are filled with people with big issues, provocative solutions and a desire to speak up.
THE GUARANTEE:If you don’t think it’s worth what it costs, send me a letter when you get home and I’ll refund your money. Alas, no refunds for no-shows.
HOW MUCH?There are ten slots for non-profits. These are available by application (seethis filefor details). It’s free to the ten accepted, but you pay in advance and I send you a refund if you show up.
A standard seat costs $1,650 for the day. Coffee, lunch and snacks are included. I promise you’ll get to ask your questions and talk about your organization.
If you buy three seats for your colleagues, the fourth is free. Buy six and get three free.Feel free to round up friends and come as a group if you like.
It’s sort of by application, but applying early increases your chances I can find you a slot.
We don’t bill, you have to pay in advance. Seethis filefor details.
THE DETAILS:Feel free to arrive as early as 8:45 am at the venue. The event begins at 9:15 sharp.
We work all day, right through lunch until 4:30 pm.
It’s in mid Manhattan, in the fanciest neighborhood in North America, so hotels and cabs and airlines should be easy to identify and book. You’re on your own.
BLOG REFERRAL BONUS:If someone mentions your blog when they register, I’ll pay you $100. One blog per registration, of course, but no limit on bonuses per blog, naturally.
FULL?When the seminar is full, I’ll edit this post and tell you. Until then, feel free to submit your registration info.","December 18, 2005","Seth Godin, Whiteboard Seminar, Marketing"

The e-consultancy interview,"You can find the originalhere.Pithy, for sure:
. . .
1. Does it perplex you that many big brands still have reservations about the web?
Not at all. Big brands got that way by doing the things that workedover and over. They’re not good at the new, and they’re horrible atexperimenting.
2. Should every business use the internet to communicate? What are the basics of an internet communications strategy?
You should only use the internet if you want your communications tobe FAST and you want to reach LARGE NUMBERS with no intermediaries. Ifyou can’t handle that, though, you shouldn’t try.
3. How can an enthusiastic marketing executive convince a senior board of Luddites to invest in digital?
What works is success. That’s how Google got so big. Once peoplemake money paying 10 cents a click, they beg to buy more at 15 cents aclick.
The best online efforts have worked because of this incremental approach.
4. You’ve written about permission marketing extensively, yetintrusion is still a big part of the average internet session. Doesthis frustrate you?
Not any more. Like everyone else, I ignore it.
What a waste.
5. Interruptive online ads are thought to damage brands, yet westill see an awful lot of advertising clutter on the major publishingsites. What would you say to these publishers and advertisers?
They’re not listening, so I can’t say much of anything.
If they were listening, I’d ask them to do one thing: measure.
6. About 7 years ago you suggested that banner ads would befinished by 2000. Well, we’re still seeing them, but paid-search is nowking. Is there a place on the web for display advertising?
I was awfully close to being right, my friend. The value of onlinebanner ads is close to zero. The best display ads are contextual,relevant and interesting. And not banner shaped.
7. Does online advertising have to be purely about response? What about the brand benefits?
There’s zero evidence that you can build a brand with interruptions online that don’t lead to action. Zero.
8. Something like one in four rich media ads are those horriblefloating ads, essentially pop-ups 2.0. Is it just me or is this totallynuts, given the ever-increasing percentage of installed pop-upblockers…?
Not sure how many people have them actually installed, andironically, most of these are bought by those that measure (spammersmeasure too). If it works, people are likely to try it…
9. Do you have any insight on the value of a customer who respondsto an intrusive call-to-action such as a floating ad, as opposed tosomething permission-based?
It depends what you’re selling. There are many businesses that depend on (and profit from) clueless consumers
10. I guess that the majority of online marketers still perceivethe web as an acquisition channel, rather than a customer relationshipchannel. Would you agree?
I would agree that they perceive it that way, and of course, they’d be expensively and dangerously wrong
11. I think a big trend over the next few years will be a shiftingfocus towards using the web channel to increase retention, repeatbusiness and referrals. Can you sum up the basic opportunities in thisarea?
It’s like dating. Communication is good. Isolation is bad. No sense letting people simmer with bad feelings, right?
12. Right. So what about email? What’s the future looking like for email marketing?
Not good. RSS, I believe, is the next big thing
13. Yahoo has just added RSS feeds to Yahoo Mail, which will helpRSS reach the masses. Right now RSS usage isn’t into double figures,but could this be a white knight for email marketers?
It is if they do it right. Abuse your RSS feed and you’re invisible (again).
14. What’sSquidooall about?
Squidoo lets anyone build a simple, free web page that points toblogs, online stores, maps and other information on a single topic—anytopic. Each page can contain insight, bullet points, links, productsand pictures, and each page earns royalties for its creator or forcharity.
Squidoo leverages the power of personal recommendation. The sitewill eventually host millions of handmade ‘lenses’, each a focused,useful guide to some area of expertise, some glimpse of the net.Instead of aimlessly poking, a lens lets a user see the big picture—ahuman being’s big picture, the overview you need to get the meaning ofthe idea.
15. Can you explain more about ‘lenses’?
The heart of Squidoo is the lens. A lens can point the best hotelsin London. Or blogs with pictures and articles about Paris Hilton. Orpersonal accounts about Hurricane Katrina.
A lens can expose a cross-section of the web, a more personal andmore humanly relevant take that no computer could ever create. A lensis an easy-to-build page of links and referrals. Two lenses may be onthe same topic, but they are never the same — every lens is personal,and every lens is built by a person, a Lensmaster.

“We’ve been around way too long, and people haveheard all our lies. We just have to deliver.”— Rick Wagoner, Chairman of General Motors

“Psychologists tell us that the mind is under a continualbombardment of ideas, all of which are trying to make animpression on it. The prospect, therefore, does not sitaround with his mind a blank, calmly waiting for someoneor something to capture his attention without a struggle.The salesman enters a field already well occupied and mustfight for the undivided attention that is a successful sale.”

We had a snow day here in NY yesterday. Hundreds (thousands!) of kids out sledding. And most of them without a helmet.

Yet parents (and regular people too) obsess about the longshots and take crazy chances with the likely dangers.
We can shake our heads and insist that people get more rational (""how can you be afraid of flying!"") or we can understand that this is human nature.

Please hold,"I don’t get it.
It’s the holiday season. Ho Ho Ho. Spend spend spend.
Companies spend a fortune to get you to call. Call 800 CLUB MED to book a room. Call 1-800-WWW-DELL to buy a computer. And it’s not just consumer marketing. They want you to call to buy insurance, business travel, hotel rooms and a new energy-efficient roof for your warehouse.
And then, when you call… hold.
Can you imagine visiting Dell’s web site and waiting more than two seconds for it to load? Well, it takes more than half an hour to reach a salesperson at certain times if you call Dell. 1,800 seconds. Or call Club Med without a touchtone keyboard and the system hangs up on you…
Obviously, there’s a load balancing issue. In order to have enough well-trained operators to answer every call Saturday at 2 pm, they’d have thousands of underemployed people later on.
But instead of punishing the customer, why not reward them?

The problem is that people who build call centers try to lower costs instead of increase revenues. They view what they do as a commodity, not a strategic tool to dramatically increase customer joy.

And yet, no producer, no movie.
I think the producer asks questions. ""What next?"" ""What now?"" The producer is always focused on more, whether more is quality, revenue, customer satisfaction or market share.
The job you do, apparently, has nothing whatsoever to do with whether or not you have the mindset of a producer. I’ve been called by talented salespeople who are clearly producers… and by failures who were just following a script. I’ve worked with people who always manage to make something happen… and with those who manage to have an excuse ready when it doesn’t.

It also gives you an idea of the numbers game the Big Labels have to play in order to make the bucks they need to stay in business.

I’ll also point to three runners-up from my blog and will encourage my co-authors to do so as well.
SO, you do an ad on spec, and if it’s great, you get publicity far and wide, leading, perhaps to not just good feelings around holiday time but plenty of new business, and maybe a shot at being on Oprah, if that’s your business. Amateurs are welcome to apply.
The objectives:1. To generate clickthrough to the Amazon page for the Big Moo (this Amazon link).2. To generate sales of the book at that page.3. There is no number 3.
The deadline for the contest is a week from today, so if you’re going to do it, do it right now so you can submit your entry on time. (12/12 at noon EST. Send a link to your hosted ad to:seth@sethgodin.com)

Out of the corner of your eye,"There’s no such thing as coincidence.
Of course, the human mind, in its neverending quest to create meaning, invents coincidences all the time.
Weird example:
I’m a big fan of modern art, but I admit that I had never heard of April Gornick.
Tom Cohen, a board member at Squidoo, knows April.
Today, I did a search for a gas station near my house that would put snow tires on my wife’s car. Typed in my town and the word GAS into google.
Guess what the seventh match was?
The art of April Gornick.
Of course, I never would have noticed this if Tom and I hadn’t been discussing April the week before. My point, and I do have one, is that search makes it far more likely that you notice something that you weren’t expecting. Bookstores are great at situational selling, at exploiting theproximity effectto help you discover something you didn’t think you were looking for. Amazon isn’t nearly as good at that (though they’re trying.)

"The needle, the vise… and the baby rattle","Most ventures that want to grow do some sort of marketing. And that marketing can be divided into two things that work. And one that doesn’t.
Theneedleuses simple physics to work. Apply pressure to a tiny, carefully selected area and you’re going to get penetration. That’s why a 92 pound nurse can give you a flu shot… the tiny surface area of the tip of the needle has no trouble slipping into your skin.
Permission marketingis about the needle. The right person, the right message, the right moment. Anticipated, personal and relevant messages that get through to the person you need to reach.
The needle doesn’t happen all at once. You need to have the right combination of reputation, product and prospect.
Theviseuses a different principle of physics to work, but it works as well. The vise is about providing increasing amounts of pressure over the entire area. And because of the nature of a screw, you can create huge amounts of pressure over time without overexerting yourself. Get your hand stuck in a vise and you’ll see what I mean.
The vise approach works, for example, with Starbucks, or with the local doctor’s office or in grassroots politics. Show up often enough, be in enough places, engender enough support from one individual after another, and sooner or later, your investment in spreading the word pays off.
What doesn’t work? What doesn’t work is the annoying baby rattle.
Babies will occasionally get quite energetic in using a rattle to get attention. But then they get bored and move on to other techniques. Sooner or later, they come back to the rattle, frustrated that nothing seems to work.
Most marketers, and just about all struggling marketers, are rattlers. They try some gimmick or technique or product, focus on it for a little while, then lose interest and move on.

The best marketers, of course, use the needle and the vise at the same time. They don’t assault, they don’t demand, instead theyearnattention. And they apply their marketing pressure so consistently and in such a measured and relentless way that sooner or later, they profit from it.
One commercial website I know is spending millions tightening their vise. Unfortunately, the offer and the site design is so confused (and unappealing) that it’s unlikely they can make the system pay. If they figured out where to apply the pressure, what offer would appeal, how to reach the right person in the right way… their leverage would triple.
The ironic thing is that ad agencies have been backed into a corner and mostly do rattling. It’s the high-cost, high-profile, high-risk part of marketing, and the kind that rarely works. What a shame that some of the smartest people in our field aren’t allowed (by their clients and by their industry’s structure) to get behind the scenes and change the product, the strategy and the approach instead of just annoying more people with ever louder junk.",,"marketing, needle and vise, permission marketing"

"Don’t change, sue","I continue to be puzzled by the car industry’s ongoing fight against better mileage (Bennington Banner – Headlines.) Imagine how moribund the computer industry would be if processors never got faster. You’d only buy a new computer when your old one got too dusty.
If mileage requirements went up, people wouldn’t buyFEWERcars. They’d buymorecars, more often. Yes, there’s no question that short-sighted consumers are regularly seduced by low initial prices or big car styling and buy a car that costs them a lot more in the long run. But if mileage standards go up, those cars cease to be an option. What happens instead is that there’s movement, always a car a little better as they march to the standard, which gives you a reason to upgrade.
The result would be a race to make better and better cars (and to buy cars that are cheaper and cheaper to operate.) If the cars are cheaper to run, then, over time, people will actually be willing to pay more for them, won’t they?
If I were a big company CEO facing such an incredible level of uncertainty about the key input to my product (the price of gas), why wouldn’t this be a great way to simultaneously level the playing field (ten years from now, which is plenty of time to get ready).
It’s like the cigarette companies. Think about how much they would have pocketed in profits if they had supported a ban on advertising ten years ago. Billions and billions of dollars…

The interesting ideas in a changing world are those that inform us about how to behave in the future. New rules are worth learning.
On the other hand, if someone breaks a rule in a way that can rarely be duplicated, we don’t learn a whole lot–unless there’s a pattern.
I think Alex brilliantly manipulated the current architecture of the web in order to earn a substantial profit. And he did earn it… his investment of cash and time was substantial.
When I see the 10,000 copycats out there, all I can do is sigh. Why do they believe this is a new trend? Why do they think it’s going to become an important part of the marketing mix, and are they really so naive to believe that they, and they alone, will earn even more than Alex did?
Yes, ""? and the Mysterians"" hat a hit song and wore masks, but that doesn’t mean that wearing a mask and naming yourself after a punctuation mark is a new rule.
I’m frequently reminded of the lemming gene in mankind when I clean out my spam box. A subject line will show up and within minutes, it will be copied by 100 other spammers. Because copying the new rule feels easier and safer and more profitable than inventing a new rule. And in the world of spam, it guess it probably is.

Non-linear media,"Lynn Russo just did an email interview with me about a phrase I hadn’t thought much about. Thought you might want to read the entire thing:
First, can you tell me, what does the term nonlinearmean to you when it comes to advertising and marketingonline?
During the tv-industrial complex, shows and ads werelinear, because producers of media assumed we would start atthe beginning and sit till the end.
Enter the remote and tivo and the web and suddenly, you caninteract with what you want, when you want.
In what ways is online media already nonlinear?
online media has always been non linear, which is why everysingle person or organization that has tried to turn the web into a big TVhas failed.
What value does this bring to the advertiser?
Most advertisers see a threat. Smart advertisers see achance to deliver anticipated, personal and relevant ads tothe people who choose to get them.
How do customers react/respond to the nonlinear aspectsof online media compared with the way they respond to a morelinear campaign?
Almost all ""campaigns"" are linear, because that’s howadvertisers, producers, directors and story tellers think.
Are customers driving this nonlinear movement?
On the other hand, consumers of media don’t think that way.We browse. We reject the storytelling arc and just take whatwe want, and then move on.
Where do you see this going? How will online media andpromotion become increasingly more nonlinear?
What works: messages from many places, not one, directed tomany different types of people, not one, that tell a storywe want to hear, but do it in many different ways
Can you think of any good examples of non-linear use ofthe Internet?all the stuff that works on the net… from chat to blogs toadwords to google… it’s all non-linear.

Even though they paid for the flight, it’s not the flying they paid for. It’s the getting there. And getting there means anxiety for some people. I think getting on and getting settled and not missing the flight no matter what are all steps that people take to reduce their anxiety.

Understanding the funnel,"I’ve been talking about funnels for almost ten years, but realized I hadn’t blogged on this… so here goes.
Traditional marketing divides the world into two groups:prospectsandcustomers
Customers are traditionally undervalued, and prospects are all treated the same.
As marketing got more sophisticated, some prospects ended up being treated a little differently than others. Someone readingField & Stream, for example, is a more valuable prospect to a bullet company than someone readingBass Fisherman.
Missing from this demographically-based analysis is the idea that people can change. They change their posture, their attention and their attitude. And as the knowledge they receive increases, their value as a prospect changes as well.
I think marketers always knew this, but they haven’t been able to do much about it.
Until now.
The Google funnel is easily measured and if you’re marketing anything to anyone, you need to understand it (this idea is so powerful it’s now built in to Google’s free web analytics program, Urchin).
Imagine someone out there, surfing on the web. He is a prospect of your fishing bait company in that one day, he might become a customer. He’s at the top of the funnel.
Now, he types ""bass"" into Google. Through that action, he has self-identified as a better prospect. He’s moved down the funnel and become more valuable to you.
But, of course, he might have meant ""bass"" as in ""bass guitar."" Once he refines his search in that way, he’s jumped out the funnel. For right now, he’s not worth much.
But wait! He has refined his search by typing in ""bass fishing."" Now, he’s worth a great deal more than he was just a moment ago. Which is why AdWords is such a good idea.
You have a choice when you run an AdWord ad. You can write copy that gets lots of clicks, or more specific copy that gets fewer, but better clicks. Traditional marketers believed that attention was free, and the more the merrier. But Google charges by the click, so new marketers realize that they are willing to pay extra for folks a bit farther down the funnel.
Now, if he’s clicked on ""Bass Lures for serious fishermen,"" our surfer’s value has just increased immensely. And you’ve paid handsomely for borrowing his attention from Google. Now the prospect is on your site, and his value to you is quite high–and his cost is high as well.
At this point, your job isnotto make a sale. Selling is just one option in a range of things you can do to further drive him down the funnel. You can engage in a dialogue (by phone or email) that takes place over time and avoids the all-or-nothing cliff of ""buy now or go away forever"". You can further inform or entertain, all in the service of your goal of increasing the interest, education and value of this prospect.
Now, finally, you have refined the traffic in the funnel. Everyone at the bottom is ready to buy, to engage with you, to become a customer.
Once you see the funnel, it’s easy to understand how valuable your existing customers are, and easy to think about how you want to spend time and money in promoting and building your site. Most marketers are running a flat campaign. Embracing the funnel changes the way you treat people. And treating different people differently is what consumers demand.","January 19, 2006","funnel, prospects, marketing"

Everybody stalls,"There’s no question about whether you are procrastinating about something. The only question is: what?
Knowledge work creates myriad opportunities for stalling. You can stall about making a salescall, stall about redoing a website, stall about reorganizing your department… the list of areas is so long, it becomes a stall in itself.
But deep down, you already know where you’re stalling. It’s that thing that makes you uncomfortable, probably because it involves doing something you might be held accountable for.
The problem with Google AdSense is that it makes marketers accountable. Unlike Super Bowl ads, you can tell if your Google ads work. And so it’s easy to stall.
The problem with inventing a new product that challenges the status quo is that whoever did it is responsible for whatever happens.
The problem with prioritizing your group’s tasks and publishing the list is that it makes it really clear what you’re on the hook for.
In very tiny, very motivated organizations, new employees are often stunned by how much gets done. That’s because of how hard it is to stall.","January 18, 2006","procrastination, accountability, productivity"

Marketing to the majority,"Most marketing is focused on the biggest portion of the market, because most marketers believe that if you fill the biggest need, or market to the largest mass, the upsides are greater.
Today, in the US, it’s a holiday to honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Unlike most American holidays that are just rituals, not rememberances (how much time doyouspend thinking about Christopher Columbus?…), this holiday is fresh enough that it’s worth thinking about what it means.
Here’s a crux of the matter, at least from a marketing (not moral) standpoint: if you recognize a minority group, if you treat them not as an other but as a peer, and if you solve their problem, they will notice you, do business with you and remember you.
Not ""minority"" in the racial sense, necessarily, but in terms of any group that feels overlooked, or disrespected, or underserved.

MR. SPEAKES: What’s AIDS?
Q: Over a third of them have died. It’s known as ""gay plague.""(Laughter.) No, it is. I mean it’s a pretty serious thing that one inevery three people that get this have died. And I wondered if thePresident is aware of it?
MR. SPEAKES: I don’t have it. Do you? (Laughter.)
Before deciding that a market (left-handed people, Mac users, people who speak Spanish) isn’t worth the effort, it might be worth a moment’s reflection. Sometimes, a purple cow is just purple because it’s best at serving a nascent market. And it doesn’t matter if you’re marketing a political campaign, a non-profit or a soap.
I feel a little trivial talking about soap and computers in the same post that I mention civil rights and AIDS. But they’re all branches on one tree.

The problem with prototypes,"""This is just a sketch.""
""…a rough draft…""
""…something we threw together…""
I’m a huge fan of prototyping. Prototyping just about anything is faster and more effective than ever before. It makes hypothetical questions go away and surfaces real issues. It gets things moving. And most important of all, prototyping eliminates fear.
BUT
If you use a prototype to try to persuade someone of an idea, be careful. Most people you know are not as conceptual as you are, especially about stuff you really care about. The first prototypes for an iPod or a book cover or a Starbucks or a six-year public works construction project certainly did not impress the outsiders who saw them.
Too many times, I’ve gotten excited about an idea and created a conceptual prototype. And almost every time, people, smart people, didn’t get it.
Here’s my new prototype rule of thumb: your prototype has to bebetter(better build quality, faster interface, better lighting, whatever) than the finished product is going to be.

Every question represents a choice for the person you are asking. She can choose to take a risk and tell you truth, or she can dissemble, fib or outright lie, and save your feelings or avoid an awkward situation.
The way you ask the question, then, matters.
The easy answer to, ""Can I help you?"" is, ""I’m just looking."" On the other hand, the easy answer to, ""Do you want to see what’s on sale?"" is, ""yes.""
Most of the time, we ask questions hoping for lies. It’s easier that way.

Stuck systems,"A young friend of mine needed to create a bibliography for a school project this weekend.
I had forgotten how annoying this task was. I was also pretty sure it was obsolete.
Why, exactly, does a teacher or reader need to know the city a book publisher is based in?
If your goal as a reader (or someone checking for plagiarism or quality of research) is to get to the books that the writer used, you need exactly one piece of data: the ISBN.
A quick online search didn’t turn up what seemed obvious to me: a free service that would allow a writer to type in all the ISBNs used in creating a paper and then generate two things:
1. a bibliography based on looking up the data onlline and2. a web page that would allow the reader/teacher to see the books, their covers, links to Amazon, libraries, online references, etc.
Then, when the student hands in the paper, she appends the bibliography created by the site, and there, right on top, is the web address with all the links.
Now, the typical middle-school teacher is going to explain that kids need to learn to write biographies because it’s part of literacy. And a college professor is going to want to keep the tradition going because no one wants to be the first to end it. And an entrepreneur is going to hesitate to build the site I described because she’s worried about how hard it will be to spread this idea and how much effort will go into making it the standard resource.
And no student wants to risk a grade by breaking the system.
So, the marketer faces a challenge similar to the disruption challenge that most marketers face–how do you take a system filled with an inefficient, annoying, time-consuming, wasteful and yes, even stupid task and make it better in a way that serves all sides?
If it were me, I’d focus on being cheap and fast and viral. And the more you break the system, the better your upside.",,"bibliography, ISBN, education"

From: EricSent: Monday, February 27, 2006 2:27 PMTo: GregSubject: RE: Hosted Exchange & Outlook Web Access Account
Greg,
The $4.99 is the cost if a mailbox only(the pdf is a marketing thing).  You also need to purchase storage at $6.99 per 100MB, and you have to buy a minimum of 100MB.
So, aggressively shading the truth and tricking people is a ""marketing thing."" Next…
Just got off the phone with a computer at the local sales offices at Verizon… trying to change my service, a big chance, it seems, to make some more money at their end. Hit five or six buttons on the phone tree. Then the voice says, I’m quoting here, ""Due to excessive volume"" your call cannot be handled. And then the computer hung up on me.
I just treasure the word ""excessive."" Excessive is a factory word, not a marketing word. If you’ve got too many people calling into your sales line, you don’t have a problem, you’ve got, I think, an opportunity.
TodayTom Petersquotes from one of my favorite books,The Art of Possibility,""A shoe factory sends two marketing scouts to a region of Africa tostudy the prospects for expanding business. One sends back a telegramsaying, SITUATION HOPELESS STOP NO ONE WEARS SHOES. The other writesback triumphantly, GLORIOUS BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY STOP THEY HAVE NOSHOES.""",,"Marketing, Communication, Opportunity"
Edges and clusters,"Most organizations have a sweetspot. That’s the product or service that leads to highest profit, retention, customer satisfaction and word of mouth. If you walk into a certain bar and order a draft beer, you’re more likely in that sweetspot than if you ordered, say, a Coke. A different bar might discover that the customer that orders a top-shelf martini is most likely to lead to the best outcome.
Over time, you’ll start to develop slight variations on your sweetspot. If one kind of martini is good, then a few are even better. Pancake houses start selling Swedish, German and even Brazilian pancakes. Insurance companies start selling a dozen different variations on whole life.
Clusters work because people are likely to be drawn to a crowd. They also work because making a good, better, best comparison gives us the confidence to go ahead and buy something. It’s not an accident that profitable products like cars come in so many variations–having a choice makes it easier to choose (at least for a while). When Heinz comes in four colors, you don’t have to decide whether or not to buy ketchup… you merely have to decide which color, and they win every time.
Clusters have a few problems. The first is that you inevitably leave people out. If your restaurant serves nothing but spicy food, then the odd duck who came with a group and doesn’t like spicy food is going to go away unhappy.
Clusters get boring. If all you’ve got is another variation of the same fundraising tool that’s worked so well for you, it’s hard to get a meeting with me (again).
And most of all, clusters make it hard to develop new sweetspots. First-class long-haul travel was a great sweetspot for Pan Am, but when the world changed, they got hammered.
So, consider this: not just clusters, but edges, too.
Maybe your bar ought to start selling amazing hot chocolate.
It’s hard to make outliers, because it’s so tempting to gradualy work your way over, making each new product an extension of your sweetspot. That doesn’t work. It just adds skus to your life.
An edge needs to be sharp and abrubt and distinct in order to generate the light it needs to thrive.",,"sweetspot, clusters, edges"

It’s so tempting to compress your ideas into the smallest possible space and assume that the text or the images or the design will carry the day. But we know that repetition is essential.

The culture of dissatisfaction,"Las Vegas is an epicenter of a trend that is accelerating through every market and community on Earth.
A rapid increase in dissatisfaction.
If you don’t have enough money, you can fix it by gambling. It’s okay to be dissatisfied with your job and your boss and your income, because someone in Vegas has more, and they got it the easy way. I don’t think it’s an accident that we’ve got record PowerBall prizes and record PowerBall sales.
If you don’t have a beautiful, thin, buxom wife with flaxen hair (or an intelligent, tall, dark-haired husband with washboard abs), it’s obvious that you can find someone better at the strip clubs and revues in town.
Porn and its variants (tech-porn included) often trains people to be dissatisfied. Apple hasn’t even shipped my MacBook yet, and they already upgraded it for free–but I’m still dissatisfied (now there’s an even faster option!).
We’re using electronic media to spread this benchmarking message far and wide. Because there’s always a company offering a better or cheaper or faster product, or a person who’s more clever than Oprah or cuter than Tyra, it’s easy to shop around, to demand more, to be constantly dissatisfied.
Every day I get angry email (not angry with me, fortunately, but angry nonetheless) from consumers of all kinds complaining about perceived slights in customer service. Looked at with a clear eye, most of these complaints don’t make a lot of sense. Yes, the correspondence could have been a lot more thoughtful, but these are organizations that are largely doing a great job, at a great price. Doesn’t matter. Someone else is often more, faster, better, now.
The problem with this emerging culture, aside from the fact that we’re unhappy all the time, is that it doesn’t give marketers a chance to build products for the long haul, to invest in the processes and products and even operating systems that pay off over time. The problem is that when brands fizz out so fast, it’s hard to invest in anything except building the next hot brand.
Is there an answer?
Talk to people who live in Vegas and you’ll discover that most of the hard-working folks who have been here more than a decade (the cab drivers and the doctors and the rest) aren’t so swayed by the billboards and the promises. Instead, they embrace the qualities that come from relationships. A relationship with a front-line worker (ask for ""Bob"")  or a relationship with a provider or an organization that has come through for them.
It seems to me that insulation from discontent comes from building a relationship. From real people. Relationships that make us feel counted upon, respected, trusted and valued cut through the ennui of dissatisfaction. We got ourselves into this mess by acting like smart marketers, and as marketers we can get out of it by acting like people.","February 19, 2006","dissatisfaction, relationships, consumer culture"

What if the fisherman had my preferences and just let me know when he had a good haul? I could meet his truck at Union Square and buy direct, fresh, for $5.

I really appreciate that you purchased a VTech phone, and I’m truly sorrythat you’re having this problem.  You indicated that there is notone/pulse switch on the bottom of your base unit as shown in the owner’smanual.
You’re right! This isn’t the first time we’ve run into this issue; it appearsthat when we updated the phone model we didn’t update the owner’s manual.
We try hard to catch these errors, but every once in a while one getsthrough.  You can switch your base between pulse and tone mode by holdingdown the ""Select"" button for a couple of seconds.  The display on the baseunit will read ""TN"" if you’re in tone dialing mode, and ""PU"" if you’re inpulse dialing mode. Just press and hold ""Select"" again if you need tochange between modes.
Once again, I’m sorry that our owner’s manual was not updated to reflectthis change.  If there’s anything else I can do for you, just let me know!

Obviously, he’s upset. The whole point of the stupidity of Valentine’s Day is that you have to have the goods, on time, or it doesn’t count.
But what’s enraging about this note is that it’s not from a real person. That they don’t explain why or how they screwed up. That they didn’t learn anything. And that they don’t accept responsibility.
What if Shari herself had written? What if she had explained what had happened, how it wouldn’t happen again, and what she had learned?

Categories and the short head,"Zipf’s Law tells us that something that ranks #1 in a category often sells 100 times as well as the item ranked #100. Human nature makes that likely–we want to read the most popular book, hire the most successful speaker, travel to the most desired place.
Which means that the category you’re in matters.
The New York Times doesn’t have one bestseller list, it has many. Hardcover and paperback, sure, but also non-fiction, fiction and ""advice, how to and miscellaneous."" When one book threatens to dominate a category (as Harry Potter did) they invent a new one just for that book.
This week’s Times reports that James Frey’s controversial book is still ""non-fiction"" (with a disclaimer) and that Malcolm Gladwell’s fine books continue to be non-fiction as well (though mine are considered advice, how-to or miscellaneous, not sure which, not sure why). Dave Barry, surprisingly, doesn’t write humor (which is miscellaneous, right?) or even advice (his new book parodies money books) but is, in fact, non-fiction.
It matters at the Times because the advice category is the most competitive and also the shortest.
The reason you should care about all this:you are in a category too. So is your organization.
And you have a lot of influence over what category you’re going to be placed in.
For example, there are a lot of software products (fireclick, hitbox, etc.) that measure analytics. Unfortunately for these guys, in the very same category is Google analytics, which is free. Google is now the official short head of analytics, and as long as you are in the same category as they are, you’re in trouble.
For example, there are a lot of software engineers looking for jobs. And some of those engineers have absolutely stellar backgrounds and great skills. As long as you are in the same category as they are (and there’s only one slot available) then they get the short head advantage.
For example, there are a lot of blogs. Blogs that invent brand-new categories grow far faster than those that just live in an existing category.
Sometimes you want to be in a category unto yourself. This works with blogs or (sometimes) with blockbuster movies (ask Mel Gibson).
Squidoowas most intentionally placed in the Web 2.0 category. Not because it changed what the service does, but because the attributes and attention of that category were both a good fit and moving in the right direction (up). If you can join a category that is already generating conversations, you’re more likely to get talked about.
Other times, you want to be in a category with a lot of churn that is proven popular. Like non-fiction books or cosmetics for teenagers. Here, the current short head leader won’t last long, and if you’re in the right line, you might be next.
What you don’t want to do, it seems to me, is not pay attention to which category you are in. Pick your category and live and breathe and act appropriately for that category. Choose wrong (the way Pringles potato chips did) it might take years or longer for people to notice and embrace what you’ve built.","February 13, 2006","Category, Short Head, Market Positioning"

"Hearing, Listening, Action","Lunch today was supposed to be at Eata Pita in the basement of Grand Central Station. I was there early, there was no line.

The guy just looked at me.
No surprise. I mean, it’s like Grand Central Station in there sometimes. He couldn’t hear me.
So, I repeated myself. He smiled, scooped up some hummus, added some lettuce and started to close up the container.
""Could I have some hot sauce, please?… and a whole wheat pita?""
He hadn’t been listening.
He smiled and put the hot sauce on the hummus, sealed it up and gave it to the cashier, and then walked away. He obviously heard my repeated request for a whole wheat pita, but didn’t take action.
The cashier looked at me with the universal, ""I was standing here but didn’t listen or hear and have no idea what you just ordered"" expression. ""A hummus with whole wheat pita,"" I said, helpfully.
She rang me up. No pita.
""Can I have a whole wheat pita please?""
She turned around, grabbed a wrapped pita from the top shelf, smiled, and put it in the bag. I went to the train. Opened my lunch as we pulled away. Not a whole wheat pita. A poisoned white bread pita, food of the oppressors!

More on stamps,"I’ve gotten a lot ofpushbackon mypostabout stamps and friction and metrics.
Let me clarify, because I was making a different point (about measuring) so I glossed over the stamps idea:
1. we all agree spam is a pox.2. spam exists because of the free rider problem. Without friction, without responsibility (it’s anonymous) and with the cost absorbed by the ISP and the recipient, bad actors cause a problem.3. also a problem: even permission email gets used up when senders take short term gains because it’s free. I probably don’t need all those emails from Amazon every time a book ships.
So, the answer I’ve agitating for is to add friction.
Stamps are great because you have to buy them. And buying them requires you to acknowledge who you are. Anonymity goes away.
Imagine a few big ISPs get together and say:
a. everyone gets an RSS reader that’s easy to use. If you want to have frequent permission-based contact with organizations, put their RSS feed here.
b. there are other organizations you give permission to email you. But you don’t want to hassle with RSS. No problem. Those organizations will pony up a quarter of a cent and that email ends up in your inbox. With a special flag indicating that the (non-anonymous) sender indicated you had signed up for it.
If you didn’t sign up for it, let us know. If more than a tiny number of people call it spam, then that sender is busted. They forfeit a bond and we blacklist them. Just because they paid doesn’t mean they can spam.
c. the old rules of email remain. BUT, if you get an email from someone who is not on your address list OR they’re not paying a quarter of a cent, we assume that this is mail you don’t really want and we put it in your suspect folder. Of course, you’re always welcome to take it out of that folder, add the sender to your favorites list (with one click) and that’s that.
So, what would happen:
a. the ebays and the amazons of the world would be in your rss reader, where they belongb. the amount of spam in your goodbox would be tinyc. people with legitimate reasons to reach you who don’t want to pay the quarter of a cent would be in your otherbox, waiting for you to find them.
Who wins:
a. ISPs. They save processing power, they make a few million bucks in stamp sales, they have happier users.
b. users. Less hassle getting through their inbox.
c. marketers with real permission who have an RSS relationship.
d. marketers with real permission who get more than a quarter of a cent of value out of bothering you (and again, if it’s not worth a quarter of a cent to you, it’s hardly worth three seconds of my time.
Who loses:1. spammers. They default to the spam box.2. marketers who measure tonnage.","February 7, 2006","Stamps, Spam, Friction"
Fashion breaks,"Should we be angry when an iPod breaks after two years? Joe Nocera sent Apple a Nastygram in the Times yesterday (reveries).
I think it’s misguided.
""Hey, I bought this suit from Brooks Brothers two years ago! And I just spilled chicken soup all over it, and now they won’t fix it or take it back."" Even worse, Brooks Brothers doesn’t even offer an extended warranty…
There’s still a business called the Fountain Pen Hospital. When you buy a pen for $100, you expect that maybe you can get it fixed. But pens are now disposable fashion items, not tools that last a lifetime.
What Steve Jobs has done, brilliantly, is turned the iPod into a fashion item. The very first iPods, the ones you can buy on eBay for $30, those still function fine. If you want a tool, buy one of those. But if you want to show off how cool you are, you need a fashionable one. When you buy a fashion, Joe, realize that this is what you bought… the fashion.

Making your numbers,"See the woman on your right? She’s cheating.
When you use a Stairmaster, you can score higher numbers by using your arms for support. This technique allows you to work out at a higher number.
Ridiculous.
Ridiculous because the number has nothing to do with her fitness. She is actually hurting her arms and back, just so she can work out at 12 instead of 11.
It’s human nature to want to beat your metrics.
The challenge comes in setting metrics that make sense.
In thisarticle,Saul Hansell writes about a long overdue innovation that I’ve been lobbying for since 1996: stamps. Stamps for email add friction and will eliminate spam if applied properly. Bulk mailers pay a quarter of a cent per email to get their permission-based email handled properly. The rest gets treated as junk. (The new program isn’t just like my concept, but very close).
Matthew Moog of Coolsavings doesn’t like this idea. ""No one wants Goodmail or any other provider to set up a tollbooth thatmakes it cost-prohibitive for legitimate mailers to reach the in-box,"" he says.
I say that the right metric isn’t how much it costs to send a mail. It’s how much sending a mail isworth!In other words, if an industry-wide .25 cent stamp eliminates spam, it’s likely to double or triple the response rate to permission mail. A boon! If you send me 100 emails with stamps, and I read them all, you’ve spent a quarter. If you can’t cost-justify that, you shouldn’t be writing to me. If I were an email permission marketer, I’d love this… the same way the DMA should have embraced the do not call list.
The same metric mistake comes up when we see sites that do whatever they can to artificially boost traffic. Saw a blog post today in which the author mentioned the name of ten or fifteen bloggers, ostensibly in context, with links to each, all in an attempt to game the system. But what’s hisrealgoal? When increasing the metric doesn’t increase the benefit, then you have the wrong metric.
In non-small companies, you need to invent placeholders so that everyone on the team is on the same page. But careful when pursuit of the placeholder doesn’t get you closer to the thing you were seeking in the first place. (Hint: Super Bowl viewers don’t necessarily equal car buyers).",,"metrics, email, fitness"

When did the Beatles,"…become THE Beatles?
I was looking through a day by day biography of the group last night, and it quickly became clear that the image that we have of the four youngsters running away from their screaming fans didn't happen overnight.
At the beginning, they were playing two or three clubs a day, dives, making a few pounds if they were lucky. Not for a month or two, but for years and years.
As they got more traction, the thing you notice is how often they showed up on the radio. They were constantly on one radio show or another, or one multi-billed concert or another. The marketing picture probably looked like this:
Outbound marketing in every possible direction. Auditions for record labels, rejections, pitches to media outlets, concerts on spec, concerts for anyone who would show up. This is classic marketing, stuff that's easy to forget when we listen to the Shea Stadium concert or see the  guys on the cover of Newsweek. It's easy to imagine that suddenly, everyone knows you, wants you and makes it easy for you.
The next stage was brief but essential. That's when people started noticing them, started showing up, started screaming. At this moment, the Beatles didn't stop marketing. They didn't stop doing radio shows at the BBC or flying all night to play a concert in Denver (empty seats) or Kansas. During the transition stage, in fact, the Beatles and their management really poured it on.
One of the most misunderstood and misused phrases in marketing (okay, in business) is Malcolm Gladwell's, ""the tipping point."" The Beatles didn't tip. Nothing magical happened. Instead,gradually,they shifted from being the chasers into being the chased.These were the Beatles on Ed Sullivan and the Beatles on tour and the Beatles making wigs and the Beatles making movies and pioneering music videos. It was the Beatles in a frenzy, not sure what was going to come next, but pretty sure that it could all disappear in a heartbeat.
Many organizations reach this stage and stop. They harvest. They take profits and remind themselves that they are geniuses, all powerful and immune to the laws of boredom.
Only by pushing through this stage and by using their newfound power to create the last stage of their career did the Beatles actually become the Beatles.

When we rewrite history (and we do it every day) it's easy to imagine that Starbucks and JetBlue and all the other poster children for new successes just got blessed.

Going to meetings,"A lot of people get paid to go to meetings.
Not to haul lumber or polish steel or clean sewers. Nope, we get paid to go to meetings. Sales calls, presentations, and strategy sessions.
There’s been an awful lot written about how to be a better salesperson, or how to give a presentation worthy of your audience’s attention.
I want to take a few paragraphs to talk about your obligations at being in the audience.
When a sales rep shows up for a scheduled meeting, it seems to me that you’re not doing her a favor. You agreed to the meeting. You’re getting paid to be there. You might as well get as much out of it as you can, right?
I mean, if you were a volunteer, or if you’re at home, it’s a little different. But here you are at work, not pounding bricks with a sledgehammer… you’ve got the Evian and the air conditioning and hey, it’s your job to go to this meeting.
So go!
Make it work.
Same thing with that 30 minute Powerpoint that the head of the division is showing to twenty of you. Or that seminar you’re scheduled to go to tomorrow.
Here are a few tips, tips that are based on one assumption: if you do a better job in the audience, the person speaking will do a better job. You’ll learn more, get more, accomplish more, today and the next time she comes back as well.
So, here goes:
When you meet the sales rep in the lobby, have a few interesting questions ready. Offer her a glass of water. Be on time. Act like you’re glad she’s there. Even if you’re not, acting that way will get her to do a better job, and that’s your job, right?
When you go to the presentation in the auditorium, don’t sit in the back row. It doesn’t matter if you don’t feel like sitting in the front row, you should. The presenter will do a better job. And if you’re tired, work hard at smiling and making contact. The presenter will do better, especially if he’s particularly boring and nervous.
Don’t bring a bag of Fritos. Don’t sit back. Don’t close your eyes.
Do bring snacks for your guest. Do lean forward. Do smile at attempts at humor. Laugh, even.
When the sales rep is giving you the specs on the steel pipes or the consulting services, challenge him. Ask hard questions. Figure out what he knows. If it’s worth you having him come over, it’s worth discovering what he knows.
When the sales call is over, tell the truth. Don’t say, ""we’ll get back to you,"" unless you intend to. If you’re going to meet with your boss on Friday, tell him. If it’s not your decision, tell him.
Why?
Well, first of all, it’s your job. Second, it’s more likely he’ll try hard for you the next time you need him to.
If someone flies across the country to see you, offer to call her a cab to get back to the airport. If you can, put it on your account. It makes a huge difference.
When you treat your vendors the way you’d like your vendors treated, it comes back to you. It pays off. It gets you better information, better attention, better prices.

Waiting in line,"The airport in Las Vegas is at maximum capacity. It’s jammed. There is a line for everything, even the men’s room.
What amazed me, though, was the line ten or twelve deep at the food concessions. People were waiting ten minutes or longer to buy a bottle of water for $2.59 or a yogurt for a few dollars.
All day, every day. A line.
On the way home from the airport I called an organization that sells $500 training programs to businesses. Even though I was trying to reach someone that worked there, I was calling in on the orders line (the only number I had). I waited 15 minutes to talk to a real person.
Think about that.
In both cases, this is the last step of a very expensive chain. It’s expensive to rent that space in the airport. Expensive to outfit it. Expensive to bring in all the supplies. It’s expensive to build a training business, expensive to have the outbound marketing, the brochures, the events worth talking about.
The last step, though, that’s cheap. The last step, the step where someone actually takes your money–it’s not just cheap, it’s nothing but incremental profit.
It amazed me that no one had bothered to look a the concessions at the airport. To do simple things, like change the pricing so that with tax, everything came out evenly–no need to make change. Or to change the product line up, eliminating the items that take five times as long to prepare. Never mind the more creative things, like having an employee working the line, taking orders in advance and bringing back change so that the person at the counter could work three or four times faster…
And what about the training company? This is classic business-to-business order taking, and I’m unable to think of one reason that you don’t get a human being on the first ring. No auto attendant, no queue. Just a person, ready to answer the phone. Even one non-lost order a day pays for an entire person’s salary.

Real creativity,"Where does it come from? What is it?
Well, if you’re disheartened by my previous post about licensing your idea, here’s the punchline: Real business creativity comes from boundaries.
Inventing something cool that can’t be implemented isn’t creative. It’s mostly a waste.
I think that inventing the unimplementable is a fine hobby, but it’s also a bit of a crutch. Yes, of course we need big visions and big ideas, but not at the expense of the stuff you can actually pull off.
So, let’s get specific:
If you’ve decided you want to create a breakthrough in your area of expertise (say Ajax coding), then either be prepared to launch and run it when you’re done, or have a clear licensing strategy in mind, one where you’re not the first person in history to pull it off.
If you’ve decided to invent a great idea for a book, better be ready to write it too, and either find a publisher or publish it yourself. There’s no market for book ideas.
If you want to do creative ads, it helps to have clients willing to run them.
These constraints are the best part of being creative, as far as I’m concerned. I couldn’t imagine writing Superman comics. The rules are too vague. There are too many choices. In non-profits and organizations and even in politics, the rules are pretty obvious (sometimes they’re too obvious). So the real creativity comes in navigating those rules in a way that creates a breakthrough.
One of my favorite triumphs of all time happened on my first day of work at my first real job, 1984, Cambridge, MA. No voice mail in those days. I was employee #30. I walked in and there was a plastic carousel, about 18 inches in diameter, with 40 slots in it. Like thin slices of pizza, but 4 inches deep. Each slot had a sticker with a name typed on it. Not in any order, particularly.
Every day, when you went into work, you had to spin the carousel around and around until you saw your name, and then grab whatever pink slips had your phone messages on them.
Now, there are 100 better ways to do this system. Faster and easier. But 99 of them required getting a new carousel or device.
Instead, I grabbed a paper clip and put it on my slot. I could find my slot in a heartbeat now.
Within a day, the carousel was covered with flags and widgets and more. Problem solved.
See the rules. Keepmostof them. Break one or two. But break them, don’t bend them. (thanks toCurtfor various inspirations).","March 26, 2006","Creativity, Constraints, Innovation"
Q. How do I license this great idea?,"A. Well, it depends.
It’s a classic story: basement inventor dreams up an idea, a product, a concept for a movie or even a new slogan for a company. He’s sure, certain, positive, that the idea, in the right hands, has huge legs. And it’s the idea that matters, right?
""This fishing lure is dramatically better than what’s out there.""""This swoosh logo is really dramatic.""""This promotion for a bar in town will make them a huge amount of money.""""If I could just get Mark Burnett to listen to this idea for a Survivor sequel…""
And most of the time, you’re right. Your better UI/software/conceptwouldmake more money in the right hands.
This disconnect drives people, especially engineers, crazy. The processes of improvement and ideation demand that you take things that aren’t so good and make them better. If someone has go to market power or even better, sales and influence power, then why wouldn’t they want to improve?
The problem is this: 99% of the time, they don’t.
It’s not that they’re stupid. It’s just that they’re not organized to turn your big idea into something that actually works.
They don’t have someone on staff who will get promoted for finding you.They don’t have a team on staff who can develop your idea and get it out the door.
There are exceptions (book publishers, for example, are good at publishing new books). But most of the time, that’s not the business they are in. They are in the business of doing their job, and their job rarely includes taking the time (and the risk) of hunting for new big ideas outside the organization.
First,there’s the huge problem of NDAs and being accused of stealing stuff. If you want me to keep something a secret, and you won’t tell me the secret before I sign a piece of paper, my risk is huge. On the other hand, if you tell me an idea (almost always non-protected) before I sign the paper, why sign it? Big paradox.
Second,there’s the problem of what it’s worth. What is the basic idea behindStar TrekorMission: Impossibleworth? Would a different two-paragraph treatment really have made the difference between success or failure? The producers of those shows would tell you it was the 10,000 little things that happenedafterthe original idea that made the difference between success and failure.
In other words, it’s how you tell it.
If you think your idea is worth a lot, and the producer of the product (whether it’s a widget or a business process) points out how many choices she has and how little the original idea is worth–you guys are stuck.
True story: I helped invent the first fax board for the Mac. Pitched it to a dozen companies. No one nibbled. Apple launched it soon after seeing ours, and the product quickly became a low-profit commodity. I’m confident that if we had created a substantial organization and built a marketing aura and system around the product, it would have worked. The idea itself… nah.

"“Hey, let’s go to Budapest!”","This phone booth sign so clearly captures the new divide between old and new marketers that I couldn’t resist.
Delta, an airline teetering a knife’s edge from insolvency, just added service to Hungary. So, naturally, they need to alert people and get them to fly there.
""I know!"" says the old-school marketer. ""Lets copy the format of Continental’s wordplay ads and buy thousands of dollars worth of ads. Maybe we’ll run into someone about to fly to Hungary who doesn’t have a travel agent or use an online travel service–we’ll get them at just the right moment and make a fortune.""
Why not spend the money on the plane?
Why not change the service itself, change it in some way that the community of travelers to Budapest will talk among themselves about how Delta is the very best way to fly there. Maybe even the bloggers and the travel editors will talk about it too.

Different kinds of broken,"but the same cause.
The first picture is of the conference room schedule at the Venetian Hotel. Microsoft booked a whole bunch of breakout rooms, so of course, someone followed policy and entered them all into the computer. This creates many many screens showing the same thing again and again. The person who typed in the list was following instructions. Missing was any judgment, anyone saying, ""Why don’t we either put a different description for each breakout, or not bother listing them at all?""
The second picture is of a sign at JFK. It’s right next to the one and only electrical outlet. Apparently, people plug in their laptops and lean against the phone booth to use them.Instead of going to all the trouble to make a permanent metal sign (""do not sit on ledge""), why didn’t someone put a chair there? Or requisition some more electrical outlets? Or build a stronger ledge? By ""solving"" the problem by telling people not to do the convenient thing, they haven’t helped the airport or the traveler. Of course, that’s not the signmaker’s problem. Someone is asssigning tasks instead of solving problems.",,"broken systems, decision-making, problem-solving"
Q: How can we get our company funded,"A: Don’t.
I’m frequently asked (by friends, and sometimes, aggressive strangers) to help them find someone to fund their company. Often, but not always, these people are happy to hear the following answer.
1. If you fund your company, even a little, you’ve just sold it. Maybe not today, or tomorrow, but one day. That’s because rational investors are funding your company in the expectation that you are going to sell it and make them a profit. (sure there are exceptions, but not many). So, if you don’t expect that your company will be easy to sell for a big profit, or you don’t ever want to sell your company, it’s not a smart idea to raise money for it.
2. Most companies are not appropriate sites for VC money. That’s because they’re freelance ventures, not entrepreneurial ones. A freelance venture is one where you work to get paid. An entrepreneurial one is where you can make money while you sleep. Meaning that you work really really hard and you scale and suddenly you own real estate or media properties or technology or a system or a brand that people pay for without you actually doing any incremental work yourself.
3. One friend ran a very successful specialty school. He decided he wanted to start a division that would sell books about his system. The numbers on the publishing side were terrific (on the spreadsheet). The investors wanted 40% of the existing business in order to put up sufficient money to recapitalize everything and bring big company thinking etc. etc. I pointed out that this would not only ruin my friend’s life, but probably cripple the economics of both businesses.
The alternative (which might work for you as well) is not to fund the business. It’s to fund theproject.That’s how they fund movies. You don’t get a piece of the studio. You get a piece of Rocky XIV.
If you’ve got something that works and you’re ready to go to the next level, consider funding the expansion with the payoff being a scaling piece of the project. Maybe 100% of the proceeds until the investment is repaid, then 25% after that, forever. Oncethatproject pays off, you’ll be able to fund the next project, probably on even better terms. And on and on, with each project having, if you choose, different investors and different payout streams.
4. The real lesson is this: if you absolutely need a lot of money to do a particular business and the terms you’ll need to accept to get that money are unacceptable, find a new business. Nothing wrong with that. The market might be trying to tell you something.","March 23, 2006","funding, entrepreneurship, investment"

Brown is the new black,"The bakery industry has been reeling since Atkins took a whack out of white bread.

Today at the supermarket I saw ""whole grain"" bread that had white flour as its main ingredient. Whole wheat english muffins that were less than half whole wheat. My favorite was a loaf of white bread that was actually colored brown with molasses and caramel color. ""Hey, it’s not against the law,"" they say, or, ""hey, it’s what people want…""

Here’s what I wrote about this in the July 2001 Fast Company:
Want soup? The very best soup in the entire world is served by AlYeganeh, owner of Soup Kitchen International on West 55th Street in NewYork. Slandered in a notoriousSeinfeldparody, Al’srestaurant is busier than ever. Some of the folks in the 30-minute-longline (waiting to buy a $6 bowl of soup!) are insensitive clods who sawthe TV show and want to experience a real celebrity moment. Others arelongtime customers who are willing to brave the cold to get the realthing.
Take a drive through Illinois — home to McDonald’s headquarters —and you might discover that many of the towns you pass don’t have one""real"" restaurant. No diner, no place for a fancy night out. Just aHardee’s, a Pizza Hut, and, of course, a McDonald’s. This is not aphenomenon limited to tiny towns near Springfield. There are thousandsof McDonald’s franchises across the country, along with chains likeArby’s, Subway, T.G.I. Friday’s, and countless others churning outanonymous, forgettable meals to people in a hurry. Hey, it’s what weasked for.
So what’s wrong with selling out? Paradoxically, it seems that onceyou become popular, you also become very unpopular. Suddenly, those inthe know aren’t as awed by Wolfgang Puck — not when his name isdisplayed in major airports across the country. They look down theirnoses at Yo-Yo Ma. They disdain Andy Warhol.
What is it about ubiquity that breeds contempt?
Every day, successful entrepreneurs have to make important choicesabout whether to expand, to open another branch, to franchise, tolicense. Once you’ve figured out a winning strategy, it seems onlyrational to cash out by letting the market have what it wants: more ofyou!
As long as you’re giving the market what it wants, what’s the problem? If some is good, isn’t more better?
Here’s the problem: The moment you take your special, authentic,limited-edition product and leverage it, make it widely available andnormal, the very people who loved it inevitably rebel. ""Starbucks isn’twhat it used to be,"" they tell you. The tastemakers who made yousuccessful in the first place turn on their heels when they smell thatyou’re not authentic anymore.
When a product is everywhere, when it’s hyped in the media andadvertised on the sides of buses, sometimes it seems as if the productexists and succeeds because it is everywhere. Before ubiquity, when itseemed as if the product (or its creator) wasn’t in it just for themoney, somehow that felt more real, more wonderful, more authentic.
Marketing has always been one of the most despised aspects ofbusiness. Brands, logos, salesmanship, positioning, and focus groupshave gained a reputation for insincerity and corporate greed. Most ofthis comes from people’s desire to have something real — and to get itfrom someone who isn’t trying quite so hard to sell it.
Are we ever authentic? Is fresh goat cheese made in tiny batches(bought on a farm in France) any different from huge vats of goatcheese produced by Kraft somewhere in Wisconsin and delivered weekly toyour local supermarket? What if you couldn’t tell them apart in a tastetest?
Sure, the vistas, the smell of the sheep, and the excitement of atrue discovery make the first kind of cheese seem to taste far betterthan the second. But isn’t that just another form of marketing? Whydoes the intention of the creator have so much influence on ourperception of the product?
The paradox: Markets talk. Word spreads. When something is great, weall want it. We want it to be local and reasonably priced. And we wantreliability. We want it to be just as good every time we experience it.What’s a marketer to do? On one hand, for something to be authentic, itneeds to be rare and special and live. On the other hand, the marketdemands that it be delivered with reliability and in quantity. Whichice cream do you prefer: Ben & Jerry’s or Häagen-Dazs? Which sportsfranchise do you root for: the Chicago Cubs or a newly minted XFL team?Which jazz performer do you groove to: Miles Davis or Kenny G? What’sthe difference between authentic and manufactured?
If you’re lucky enough to create something authentic, you have realchoices. You need to decide how important it is to be real, how much ofyourself you have tied up in the authentic experience that you’vecreated. Most of all, you need to decide what you’d like to do all day.Some of us can be happy taking today’s flavor and selling it likecrazy. Others need to have a deeper relationship with their craft,something that establishes a connection between themselves and theirproduct. If you ever get a cup of soup from Al, look into his eyes.You’ll see what I mean.
People who create something authentic but then sell out almostalways end up unhappy. Why? Because once you sell out, any new successyou have isn’t because you are authentic. You’re in a new business now.Ken Burns is just as authentic as he ever was. But he’s not rewardedfor that. He’s rewarded for ubiquity. Could you be happy with that?
Before you pull the trigger and sell out and scale up, consider afew questions: Is it better to be big than to be (perceived as) real?Is spreading the word more important than being admired by a tinycoterie of truly devoted fans? Should financial rewards come to thosewho make good stuff for the masses?
Could you be happy practicing your authentic task for the rest of your life?
If you do get big, you won’t be practicing authenticity for the restof your life. When you sell out, you’re making a trade. The big marketwants reliability and conformity. The big market won’t reward you forbeing authentic.

Q: What do you think of my brochure,"A: The thing you must remember about just about every corporate or organizational brochure is this:People won’t read it.
I didn’t say it wasn’t important. I just said it wasn’t going to get read.
People will consider its heft. They might glance at the photos. They will certainly notice the layout. And, if you’re lucky, they’ll read a few captions or testimonials.
At its best, a brochure is begging for someone to judge you. It says, ""assume that because we could hire really good printers and photographers and designers and writers, we are talented [surgeons, real estate developers, whatever]"" And more often than not, people do just that.
At its worst, a brochure solves a prospect’s problem (the problem of: what should I do about this opportunity?) by giving them an easy way to say ""no."" ""No,"" she thinks, ""I don’t need to talk with you… I’ve reviewed the brochure.""

I have little respect for much of what happens at the unaccountable Port Authority, so this is par for the course. Here’s the deal:
Leaving JFK, the helpful parking attendant at the cash register handed me an envelope that says, ""Airport Parking Concept Survey"".

Only five of the questions had to do with the topic at hand, which was, [summarizing]: if we built a valet parking facility, would you use it?
Why so stupid? Why worth posting about? Because it commited several survey sins, all at once:
""Why,"" a friend asks, ""is it a bad idea for them to ask for feedback?"" My answer is that they’re not going to use the feedback because they actually want it, but because they intend to use it to sell the idea to others. They’ll pick the data they like, make it seem quite significant and accurate, and it include it in a report. It’ll tell a story.

So, the question: should you put your best song on the free CD?
If it’s your best song, and it’s free, then no one will pay to get it from iTunes. And if it’s the best song on the album, maybe no one will buy the album since they already have the song.
It’s easy to argue that you should hold back the best song, make people pay for that.

Must be the altitude,"I want to clarify the two posts below, because my email confirms that they were too sketchy and easily misunderstood.
First, Pythagorus. He was one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, and even had a little cult going for a while. A portion of his time was spent doing things that stood the test of time and were both interesting and useful. He also spent time working on reincarnation and deciding that no one in his cult should eat beans (it’s not totally clear why).
The reason I pickedperfect numbersas an example is that while his point is correct (28 is in factperfect)and while it ultimately led to figuring out prime numbers, a perfect number wasn’t nearly as important as he thought it was. It has no spiritual implications, no personality, for example. SO, to make a short story too long, I was making the point that you can never be quite sure which thing on your development agenda is the right one (your hard work might turn out to be beans) and that falling in love with your current work might not be so smart.
As far as thefunguswoman, I wasn’t dissing her. I was merely pointing out that many people are quite happy living their lives on a different part of Rogers’ adoption curve than you are. She likes being the last person in her group to try something weird. It’s worth remembering the fungus when you can’t figure out why everyone on earth doesn’t love your new idea the minute you release it.

The perfect number,"According to MarioLivio,6 is the lowest perfect number.
Pythagoras and his followers spent their lives riffing about numbers and geometry. They decided that a perfect number was a number that was the sum of its factors. 1 x 2 x 3 is the same as 1 + 2 + 3. In case you were interested, the next one is 28.
So what?
Exactly. They didn’t realize that they should have been working on calculus instead of messing around creating and polishing stuff that no one needed or cared about.",,"perfect number, Pythagoras, factors"
Fungus,"So, the middle-aged American tourist standing next to me at the breakfast buffet asked me what I had just been handed by the lovely cook on the line. ""This is a handmade corn tortilla with huitlacoche on it,"" I said, eagerly anticipating digging into it. ""You should try some.""
Huitlacoche is a fungus that grows on corn. It’s a delicacy, and quite good. The buffet was free, part of her trip. The portion was small. She could try one by investing about six seconds of her time.
Wanna guess what she decided to do?
There’s no way in the world she could know whether or not she would like it. Zero previous experience. No danger. No cost.
But she was seeing Mexico from a bus.
She doesn’t read your blog, either.

“I don’t feel like playing tonight”,"How much do you care about authenticity?
Years ago, Bill Evans walked off stage at a jazz club… and the audience applauded. Why? Even though they weren’t going to hear the jazz great and his group that night (even though they’d paid, hired the sitter, etc.) they were applauding howrealhe was. If the artist didn’t want to play, that was fine with them.
Reading an auction catalog tonight, I just discovered that Gene Roddenberry designed the phaser to be a profitable children’s toy first, a Star Trek prop second. And the only reason theKlingons had a ship is that the Enterprise model kit sold so well… They even let the model company, AMT, build the prop so that they could be sure the model sold in stores would be the same. Does that make you think anything less of Roddenberry’s universe?
Jackson Pollock painted what he wanted and died young. Andy Warhol painted what would sell… and died rich.
If I write a book or a blog post or design a web page that’s designed to spread first and inform second, do you care about my intent? It’s pretty obvious that most of the online video stuff that’s running wild online was designed to do just that–run wild. And MySpace is a traffic triumph. Not because the pages are what you or I might design, but because they were intentionally built for that sneezing teen and post-teen cohort.
When David Chase built the Sopranos, he wanted to tell a great story first, and get rich second. It was authentic in its first goal, and he accomplished his second. But when you eat at the fifth or sixth restaurant opened by a celebrity mega-chef, it’s pretty clear that the goals are reversed. Does that make the meal worse?
Is it okay to set out to serve a predictable, reliable, impersonal meal in a restaurant that costs $100 a seat?
I thought of these countless rhetorical questions when the waiter came over and said, ""Sangrias for the table? They’re really good tonight!""
Are they? Are they better than on other nights? Or is this part of the script, designed to easily improve profit per seat by 30%… By selling us on the smell of authenticity, the fact that the sangrias might in fact be special, it makes it more fun to eat there (for some). I noticed on the way out that the specials were painted on the mirror over the bar… I had a fantastic time in the restaurant, because the company and the conversation were terrific. But I couldn’t help feeling like I was a little cheated because nothing felt real.
It’s that bell curve thing again. Those of us on the left, call us the authentic fringe, value intent, sometimes even more than we care about the results. The middle, the masses, they want both, that blissful combination of authenticity (even if it’s well faked, orespeciallyif it’s well faked) and popularity. Call them the ""smells authentic"" masses. And there on the right is the factory fringe, the people who don’t want even a whiff of authenticity… it reminds them of risk and inconsistency. [click on the picture to make it readable].
Like Rogers’ product adoption lifecycle, products can move along this curve. Starbucks used to be just one place, way out on the fringe… Howard, the founder, got yelled at by his father-in-law for being a nutcase about coffee. And then, it moved to the right. Same thing for Emeril and Bobby Flay.
Of course, I’m letting my Authentic Fringe biases show here.The reason that the popular restaurants are so popular is because people like them!",,"Authenticity, Intent, Popularity"
The noisy tragedy of the blog commons,"Blogs are different than most other forms of media in one key respect: they stretch.
TV and radio confront the reality that there are only 24 hours in a day. They can’t put on more content, because there’s no down time.
Magazines and newspapers have to pay for paper, and that means ads, but there are only a finite number of people willing to pay. So the length finds a  natural limit.
Billboards confront zoning realities.
Junk mail is gated by response rates.
But blogs… you can easily post 100 times a day. With a team, it might be a thousand.
This wouldn’t be a problem except for the fact that in many cases, volume leads to traffic. Take a look at the top 10 blogs and you’ll notice that many of them post dozens of times a day.
Just like the marketers of Oreo (now in 19 flavors of cookies) we’re dealing with clutter by making more clutter.
RSS fatigue is already setting in. While multiple posts get you more traffic, they also make it easy to lose loyal readers.
Without friction, without a gate on the clutter, we clearly face acommonsproblem. Here, though, instead of people taking too much of a shared physical good because they have nothing to lose, the problem is surplus. By writing too much, too often, we’re trouncing on the attention of the commons.
Thanks toJouvenotfor inspiring this the thought, but what should we do about it?
I think the answer is subtle and simple: over time, as blogs reach the mass market, the number of new readers coming in is going to go down, and the percentage of loyal readers will increase. The loyal readers are going to matter more.
Blogs with restraint, selectivity, cogency and brevity (okay, that’s a long way of saying ""making every word count"") will use attention more efficiently and ought to win.
In the meantime, though, I don’t see the world getting any quieter.
Small addendum:some have rightly pointed out that filters and tagging mean that the commons benefits from as much noise as possible… that each blogger blogs all she wants, and the good stuff gets dugg or tagged and the rest disappears.
I have no real argument with that, except that it begs the question of who’s looking through the chaff for the wheat. If someone has a blog where every single riff is a good one, you can bet that the eager beaver taggers are going to be there, waiting for the good stuff. If, on the other hand, you have a one in a thousand hit rate, the odds of your good stuff being found are small indeed. I think what I’m suggesting (not proposing… I’m not asking you to post less!) is that if you want to have a larger voice, it may pay be to be your own filter.","March 13, 2006","blog commons, content volume, reader attention"

The gap,"Last week, I had dinner with a senior TV exec. He was not only not nervous about the Net, but he was uninterested in hearing about how it might be a threat. Today, Saul Hansell has a great piece in theNew York Timesabout slivercasts and the rapidly changing landscape.
There’s no doubt in my mind that he’s right about many of these issues, but the startling thing is the huge gap between the people with the incentive and resources to take advantage of the shift and the what the market is doing.

The best presentation…,"Ever since myearly warning shotabout Powerpoint, I’ve noticed an increasing tide of writing about:a. how much people hate giving presentationsb. how bad they are at it
I just came across a super new book on the topic,Why Bad Presentations Happen to Good Causes. Even if the content wasn’t good (it is) the quality of the printing is so wonderful, it’s a pleasure to hold. (found it courtesy of theinsight of Richard Pachter).
Part of what Andy points out is that presentations to groups of 50 or more are usually done by people who aren’t comfortable doing them, and they’re not usually very well received.
Which led to this thought:
The best presentation might be no presentation.
If you’re going to bother to do something, you ought to do it very well indeed. Otherwise, don’t. Don’t show up. Don’t waste your time (or mine.)
""But,"" you say, ""I have to."" I have to because my boss said I do, or because I can’t make the sale without it or, best reason of all, because it’s my best chance to be in a position of authority in front of a whole bunch of prospects/influencers/investors/media, etc.
But, if you’re going to do a lousy job…
So, here’s what I’d like you to consider:
Skip straight to the part that people seem to like the best, and that you’re the best at: the Q&A.
Step 1: get a confederate (a helper, not someone from Atlanta) to sit in the audience ready with the first obviously seeded question.
Step 2: Walk onstage. No laptop.
Step 3: ""Any questions?""
Step 4: The seeded question is something like: ""So, Seth, what have you been up to?""
Answer it. In English. Like the person you are, not the flat, stressed, boring person you become when you have a Powerpoint under your control.
At that point, five minutes into it, you’ve told me an honest human story about why you came and what you’re up to. Now, the audience, sufficiently engaged, will happily pepper you with questions for your entire alloted time.

Bite sized,"What do the Dubai port deal, the numa numa video, Danish cartoons and yellow wristbands have in common?
They all spread because they were easy to spread. At the same time thatclimate cancerlanguishes in the background, voters inundate Congress with phone calls about the port deal. And pundits are surprised–shocked!–at how irrational the public is.
Actually, our behavior as people is pretty easy to predict. We like things that are simple, not complex. Issues where we can take action without changing very much. If a marketer brings us a new idea, it’s either ignored or it’s a problem. A problem because we have to do something with the idea. Buy the new suit, trade in for the new car, install a new IT solution or change the way we feel about an issue.
The best problems, as far as a consumer is concerned, are those that can be solved quickly and easily, with few side effects.
Bite sized doesn’t mean small, though. When the stakes are high enough, people are willing to do really big things (like join the Army),ifthey believe that those big things are in and of themselves sufficient to have an impact on the problem. It’s bite sized, but a big bite.

And yet,Easy411provides precisely the same service to callers for half the price. Why doesn’t everyone use them? Because it’s not just the price. It’s the hassle and the set up and the ""I didn’t get around to it"" nature of saving a few bucks.
Example 2: check out the parking lot at Costco. Lots of $40,000 or more cars and SUVs in the lot, people who wasted a few shekels worth of gas to drive out of their way to invest an hour of time to save a dollar on a big jar of pickles. These are the same people who will spend an extra $100 on an airplane ticket to save a few minutes in getting home after a meeting.

Just today, while going to lunch, we spotted a young womandriving with her 4-year-old daughter who was standing up in the front seat.The idea of child carseats are still somewhat alien to Japan, a country thatonly passed its first carseat law in 1999, and children playing inside movingcars is something I’ve seen all to often.

Proof of what you already knew,"One of the most popular lenses on Squidoo is about a pro wrestler namedRey Mysterio. It happens to be a really good lens, but hey, it’s about a guy in a mask.

It turns out that a Google search (""reymysterio"" no spaces) turns up this lens as the second match.
This economy of spelling leads to thousands of organic visits. Most of those visitors leave happy, because the lens tells you just about everything you’d ever want to know about Mr. Mysterio.
The good news for Google investors is that the efficiency of using google.com means that many people (perhaps most people) start their online journey on Google, even if they know the url. (www.reymysterio.com is a site about the wrestler). That’s one reason why ads on a search page are worth so much more than ads in most other places online… you reach people on their way to somewhere else. But you already knew that.

Is there a first mover advantage?,"Some conventional wisdom says that you need to be first to win. People will point to eBay and Microsoft and Starbucks and the William Morris Agency and say, ""if it’s a natural monopoly or a market where switching costs are high, the first person in, wins.""
This argument has been amplified lately by the high cost of building a name for yourself (it would cost just too much to build a brand bigger than Starbucks in a post-TV world) as well as the network effects of things like eBay and Hotmail.
Skeptics scream foul. They point out that not one of the examples I gave above was actually the first mover. There were plenty of others that came first, and, they argue, the fast follower won by learning from the mistakes of the innovator. They argue that innovation is overrated and low costs and good service are the key.
I think both sides are wrong (and right) and the mistake is caused by the erroneous belief that there’s a market.
There isn’t a market.
There are a million markets. Markets of one, or markets of small groups, or markets of cohorts that communicate.
If you’re an eBay user, my guess is that eBay was the first auction site you used. If you use Windows, my guess is that you never used CPM. And if you are a Starbucks junkie, my guess is that you don’t live near a Peets.
What happens: the market often belongs to the first person who brings you the right story on the right day.
Yes, you must be first (and right) inthatmarket orthismarket.But that doesn’t mean you have to be first (and right) in the universe.
The market is splintering more than even some pundits predicted in1998(that would be me). Which means that the idea of monolithic marketing messages to monolithic markets makes no sense. The race is now to be the first mover in the micromarkets where attention matters.

The problem with “global warming”,"We are facing what might be thegreatest threatever to the future of mankind.
And yet no one is marching in the streets, the outrage is largely intellectual and action is slow. (If you want to argue about the science, please visit the link above, this is a post about the marketing!)
Is the lack of outrage because of the population’s decision that this is bad science or perhaps a thoughtful reading of the existing data?
Actually, the vast majority of the population hasn’t even thought about the issue. The muted reaction to our impending disaster comes down to two things:
1. the name.
Globalis good.Warmis good.Evengreenhousesare good places.
How can ""global warming"" be bad?
I’m not being facetious. If the problem were called ""Atmosphere cancer"" or ""Pollution death"" the entire conversation would be framed in a different way.
2. the pace and the images.
One degree every few years doesn’t make good TV. Because activists have been unable to tell their story with vivid images about immediate actions, it’s just human nature to avoid the issue. Why give up something we enjoy now to make an infintesimal change in something that is going to happen far in the future?
Lady Bird Johnson understood this when she invested her efforts into a campaign against litter and pollution. The problem was easy to see. The messaging was emotional and immediate. You could see how your contribution (or efforts) mattered.
Because you don’t see your coal being burned (it accounts for more than 50% of US electricity) and because the stuff coming out of your car is invisible, and because you don’t live near a glacier, it’s all invisible.

Hallmark, restaurants and others have managed to tell this story over and over again, building a multi-billion industry around a simple idea.
This is an important lesson because it shows how the right story, a story that fits an archetype, can run and grow so fast. The Mother’s Day story was a story most of our grandparents already ""knew"" and ""believed"" even though they hadn’t heard it before.

The Customer is Always Right,"Greg writes in and wants to know if that’s really true. What if the customer is anamnesiac,a jerk, a difficult blowhard badmouther? What if the customer is the sort that wears his LL Bean khakis for a year and then sends them back?
In our ultracompetitive markets, how can you possibly have a chance in the face of enormous consumer power?
The answer might surprise you. It’s the unwritten rule 3 on Stew Leonard’s famous granite rock:
If the customer is wrong, they’re not your customer any more.
In other words, if it’s not worth making the customer right, fire her.
Successful organizations (and I include churches and political parties on the list) fire the 1% of their constituents that cause 95% of the pain.
Fire them?
Fire them. Politely decline to do business with them. Refer them to your arch competitors. Take them off the mailing list. Don’t make promises you can’t keep, don’t be rude, just move on.
If you’ve got something worth paying for, you gain power when you refuse to offer it to every single person who is willing to pay you.
In 1988, my book packaging company had about six weeks worth of payroll in the bank. Yet we fired our biggest customer, someone who accounted for more than half our revenue. I still believe it was the right thing to do. We ended up happier and more successful, making up the business in a few months time.
If you treat a customer like he’s wrong, he’s going to leave, and probably tell a bunch of other people. Before you take that route, be direct, straightforward, polite and firm, and decline to sell to them.
So yes, the customer is always right. And if they’re not, then one way or the other, they’re not your customer any more.",,"Customer Service, Business Strategy, Customer Relationship"
Ode: How to tell a great story,"Chris Fralic reminded me of this piece I wrote forOde.
Great stories succeed because they are able to capture the imagination of large or important audiences.
A great story is true. Not necessarily because it’s factual, but because it’s consistent and authentic. Consumers are too good at sniffing out inconsistencies for a marketer to get away with a story that’s just slapped on.
Great stories make a promise. They promise fun, safety or a shortcut. The promise needs to be bold and audacious. It’s either exceptional or it’s not worth listening to.
Great stories are trusted. Trust is the scarcest resource we’ve got left. No one trusts anyone. People don’t trust the beautiful women ordering vodka at the corner bar (they’re getting paid by the liquor company). People don’t trust the spokespeople on commercials (who exactly is Rula Lenska?). And they certainly don’t trust the companies that make pharmaceuticals (Vioxx, apparently, can kill you). As a result, no marketer succeeds in telling a story unless he has earned the credibility to tell that story.
Great stories are subtle. Surprisingly, the fewer details a marketer spells out, the more powerful the story becomes. Talented marketers understand that allowing people to draw their own conclusions is far more effective than announcing the punch line.
Great stories happen fast. First impressions are far more powerful than we give them credit for.
Great stories don’t always need eight-page color brochures or a face-to-face meeting. Either you are ready to listen or you aren’t.
Great stories don’t appeal to logic, but they often appeal to our senses. Pheromones aren’t a myth. People decide if they like someone after just a sniff.
Great stories are rarely aimed at everyone. Average people are good at ignoring you. Average people have too many different points of view about life and average people are by and large satisfied. If you need to water down your story to appeal to everyone, it will appeal to no one. The most effective stories match the world view of a tiny audience—and then that tiny audience spreads the story.
Great stories don’t contradict themselves. If your restaurant is in the right location but had the wrong menu, you lose. If your art gallery carries the right artists but your staff is made up of rejects from a used car lot, you lose. Consumers are clever and they’ll see through your deceit at once.
Most of all, great stories agree with our world view. The best stories don’t teach people anything new. Instead, the best stories agree with what the audience already believes and makes the members of the audience feel smart and secure when reminded how right they were in the first place.

Why are you afraid of process?,"Is it because it gets in the way of intuition?
I spend a lot of time railing against organizations and teams that fall in love with process at the expense of innovation. This is not a post about that.
It’s about the opposite.
Our culture embraces the intuitive craftsman. We don’t talk about Harlequin Romances or artists who paint by number. Heroism is about writing a novel or making a sale based on what’s deep inside of you… not by following a prescribed pattern.
The plant manager who is proud of his seat-of-the-pants inventory management system, the bizdev guy who cherishes his network, the physician who relies on her diagnostic skills–these are all examples of intuitive craftspeople. Intuition, the sum total of our skill and our training, is the mark of someone to be reckoned with.
Process, on the other hand, appears to be for Dummies.
So we bristle when we’re asked for our weekly goals sheets, or when the boss wants us to use a database or when the insurance company requires docs to follow data-driven guidelines. We pass up the tenth novel by a successful author… because the process has become too transparent.
And yet, in many cases, process is underrated.
Process is your ace in the hole when your intuition stops working.
Process is the system that doubles a plant’s efficiency when you’ve done everything you can think of.
Take your web page (please). The intuitive marketer does her very best, and then conversion and traffic levels are established. That’s all.
Replace that with a process that measures and tests and improves and repeats and changes elements hourly. Replace it with a process that’s all about split testing and funnels and what works. Will a process like that invent MySpace or Flickr? Of course not. But it might very well turn your metrics from negative to positive. It might reinvent all the dynamics of your business.
What happens when a star salesperson starts tracking her calls, her time spent, her rolodex and her results? Her day isn’t intuitive any longer… just the act of selling is. The result: dramatic improvements. Measuring, and measuring in public, is a piece of process that can’t help but organize and leverage your intuition.
If process makes you nervous, it’s probably because it threatens your reliance on intuition. Get over it. The best processes leverage your intuition and give it room to thrive.","April 25, 2006","process, intuition, efficiency"

The lawyer in the marketing department,"Actually,allyour lawyers are in your marketing department.
Most lawyers view their job as a defensive one. They use phrases like, ""keeping you out of trouble.""
Unfortunately, when they interact with the public or with a partner or even a landlord, they are marketing your organization, whether they want to or not.
Consider the case of a drugstore chain that accidentally sent out a second rebate check (for $4) to hundreds or thousands of customers. The lawyer drafted a note telling customers (remember, these are the valuable ones, the ones that take action) to discard the second check. Included this line:
We are informing you of this error so you do not incur returned check feesfrom your bank, since the check is not valid. Please destroy the duplicatecheck.
So, in other words, if you cash the second check by mistake, you’re going to have to pay your bank a $25 bounced check fee on a $4 check because of an error the drugstore made.

The paradox of pictures,"I got busted at the Stop and Shop this morning.
It turns out that there are now even more than 19 flavors of Oreos. So I needed a photo of the new flavor for my presentation. The manager saw the flash and ran over. He made it clear that I needed permission from corporate headquarters to take pictures, and followed me around the store to make sure I didn’t take any more illicit photos.
Compare this to the easiest way in the world to attract a crowd at a trade show–hire some folks to film your booth, preferably with bright lights, Bauer battery packs and a big-ass camera. Sure enough, people will show up, like moths to a candle.
The irony of the Stop & Shop approach is that the people who you don’t want taking pictures–snoopy journalists or competitors–can easily conceal their cameras and you’ll never know. But the raving fans, the bloggers, the folks twisted enough to want to take and flickrize their supermarket experiences are your friends.
Of course, Ahold (owner of S&S) has every right to discourage shoppers from photography. So does Disney. But Disney learned a long time ago that flipping the funnel and letting tourists become your salesforce is a great idea.

Dial 300 for Harry,"You should go mattress shopping.

I admit, I don’t think I’ve ever been mattress shopping before. What an astonishing experience. If you don’t believe the ""storytelling"" riffs inLiars,this will convert you.

“No” to average,"One of my favorite conversations goes like this.
""Oh, by the way, I read your bookPurple Cow.I liked it a lot. I even underlined some paragraphs.""
""Thanks!"" I say. Underlining is the goal of people in my line of work.
""I can imagine that it’s really helpful to a lot of people. Unfortunately, in my [business/organization/line of work], most of what you write about doesn’t really work.""
The reason it’s such a good conversation is that people in every possible line of work have managed to tell me that the ideas don’t apply to them… and that gives me a chance to ask them more details about what they do–and within a minute or two, we’re both jumping up and down, excited with the possibilities of how itdoeswork in their line of work. Ministers, freelance photographers, real estate agents, middle managers, web site marketers–doesn’t matter, it always seems to come down to one thing:
Say no to being average.
This morning, Bradley was explaining to me that it couldn’t work in his profession as a freelance writer. It seems that almost all the clients want average stuff. Which no surprise, since average is, by definition, the stuff most people want. I asked, ""Are there any writers in your field who you hate because they get paid way too much compared to your perception of the effort they put in and the talent they have?""
""Sure,"" he said, feeling a little sheepish about being annoyed by their success.
""And how do they get those gigs?""
It’s because they stand for something. Because they are at the edges. Because if an editor wants a ‘Bob-Jones-type’ article, she has to call Bob Jones for it… and pay Bob’s fees. Bob would fail if he did average work for average editors just to make a living. But by turning down the average stuff and insisting on standing for something on the edge, he profits. By challenging his clients to run stuff that makes them nervous (and then having them discover that it’s great), he profits.
This is scary. It’s really scary to turn down most (the average) of what comes your way and hold out for the remarkable opportunities. Scary to quit your job at an average company doing average work just because you know that if you stay, you’ll end up just like them.

Archetypes,"All the marketing theory, insight and blather that I’ve read fails to explain some obvious phenonema. For example, why do some products seem to market themselves while others struggle? Why are some consumer behaviors so ingrained, while others disappear almost overnight?
So I think it’s time to talk about Carl Jung.
Here’s what the wikipedia says about Jung’s theory of archetypes:…the collective unconscious is composed of archetypes. In contrast tothe objective material world, the subjective realm of archetypes cannot be adequately understood through quantitative modes of research.Instead it can only begin to be revealed through an examination of thesymbolic communications of the human psyche—inart, dreams, religion,myth, and the themes of human relational/behavioral patterns. Devotinghis life to the task of exploring and understanding the collectiveunconscious, Jung discovered that certain symbolic themes exist across all cultures, all epochs, and in every individual.
Let me try out an example on you:
Food = Love
Parts of the world wrestle with hunger, famine and even starvation. Yet in many of these cultures, it is unthinkable to eat brown rice. Think about that.. for thousands of years, people ate brown rice, which is easier to prepare, more nutritious and far more efficient than white rice (more food per bushel harvested). And yet, there’s something so powerful about the symbol of white rice that it is embraced by people who should (and probably do) know better.
Or take it closer to home. Four obese people in a restaurant, eating far more than they should, because they can.
Or a parent sending a child to school with a white bread bagel, even though she knows that it’s not healthy–just because it’s what she grew up with.
These are all irrational acts, things that we can’t chalk up to ignorance or lack of access to alternatives. Instead, they play into a very complex set of beliefs that seem to cross cultures.
Why so much Spam (the luncheon meat, not the email) in Hawaii and other Pacific cultures? I don’t think we can chalk it up to distribution, coupons or tv ads. Instead, I think there’s a complicated relationship between an archetype and the symbols that the food represents.
I think it’s interesting to explore some fundamental consumer archetypes and how marketers have tapped into them (usually accidentally). The goal isn’t to explain the origins of these often irrational needs, but to realize that they are there. Gravity’s causes are unknown, but we still need to factor it in to our lives. Same with archetypes. We don’t have to understand them to leverage them.",,"Archetypes, Consumer Behavior, Marketing Insights"
That’s the end of that…,"Every single time I look at the price of a box of food and then throw the item in the shopping cart at the supermarket, I shake my head the way Mary Richards did in the opening credits of the Mary Tyler Moore show. I can’t help it.

Blogs and the web are killing magazines on a daily basis. The shakeout is happening before our eyes.
It will be a small-time event compared to what’s about to happen to both TV and our culture.
Everyone will have a network. Not just a show, but, if you want it, an entire network of shows. Lots of channels, with not so many viewers per channel. A network for each religious group, and variants for each sect. Every church, community group, local theatre and art gallery gets a network. Every classroom and every division of every company.
YES, human beings have a need to do what others are doing. We have a desire for mass and for fashion. And for those lucky enough to be anointed, there will be power and leverage and profits.

Vocabulary: “Landing page”,"I first started talking about landing pages in <gasp> 1991, but there’s probably someone out there who can pre-date me. Sometimes when you’ve been riffing on an idea for so long, it’s easy to believe that everyone gets it, but my mail says otherwise.
A landing page is the first page a visitor to your site sees.
Landing pages were important back in the day of email marketing, because if you included a link in your email, that was the page the permission marketee would land on if he clicked through.
Landing pages are even more important today because they are the page that someone clicking on a Google Adwords ad sees.
A landing page (in fact, every page) can only cause one of five actions:
I think that’s the entire list of options
So, if you build a landing page, and you’re going to invest time and money to get people to visit it, it makes sense to optimize that page to accomplish just one of the things above. Perhaps two, but no more.
When you review a landing page, the thing to ask yourself is, ""What does the person who built this page want me to do?"" If you can optimize for that, you should. If there are two versions of a landing page and one performs better than the other, use that one! This sounds obvious, but how often are you doing the test? How long does a landing page last in your shop before it gets toppled by a better one? And do you have a different landing page for every single ad, every single offer? Why not?
Landing pages are not wandering generalities. They are specific, measurable offers. You can tell if they’re working or not. You can improve the metrics and make them work better. Landing pages are the new direct marketing, and everyone with a website is a direct marketer.",,"Landing page, optimization, direct marketing"

If most of your answers are ""no,"" then the problem might not be with the specifics of your tactics, but might be at the strategy you’re bringing to the table. More and more, organizations are discovering that making something virusworthy is the single most important step in the work they do.",,"flip the funnel, strategy, virusworthy"
It’s good to be king,"The Times and other outlets have been running a spate of stories about executive pay. CEOs who walked away with $100,000 a day paychecks, CEOs making millions of dollars at companies in trouble, CEOs with jets and houses and limos… It’s like being a king, instead of having a job.
Marketing used to be like that (and for a few lucky brands, it still is). The folks at the Apple iTunes store are like kings, deigning to receive a long line of supplicants who want to do business with them. I would imagine that the producers at Oprah feel the same way… People in the lobby, their backs bowed from carrying a sack from a land far away, traveling miles by donkey…
Kings receive payments all out of proportion to their incremental contributions. Mass markets pay their leaders handsomely. So marketers often set out to be kings, and often act that way from the start.
The thing is, if you market like a king, you’re no longer likely to see results. Kings like to bark orders, wear crowns, eat at banquets and behead their critics.
The thing is, marketers are now peasants.
If you market like a peasant, always a supplicant, always aware of your low station in life, you’re more likely to earn attention. Yes, you need the confidence and perhaps the bearing of a king. But the best marketers today appear to be those that accept the fact that they have no birthright, they weren’t awarded the right to attention. And, who knows, over time, they might earn their way up the ladder–to king.",,"executive pay, marketing, hierarchy"

Marketing in the car business,"Ford’s North American marketing chief, Cisco Codina, quoted in today’sTimes,""There will always be early adapters…""
Actually, Cisco, the folks you mean to be talking about are ""early adopters."" And the distinction is critical and demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of what’s happening. An adapter is someone who is able to deal with changing conditions. This sort of person isn’t ruffled by a new policy or an environmental change. Let’s hope that penguins are good adapters.
Adopters, on the other hand, seek out change,wantthe new stuff. They like it. Big companies with power are used to a person adapting when they exercise their will. Small, nimble companies look for adopters.

“We wish Google didn’t exist”,"That was the phrase that got my attention.
I was talking to an exec at a 1999 new media company… one of those anchor tenants on the web, a big content website. She said something that, in retrospect was obvious, but so shocking it made me sit up straight.
""Google doesn’t help us at all. It would be great if they went away.""
It’s so easy to count on search, depend on search and assume for search that most people don’t realize how the dynamic has changed. If you’ve got a portal or a big store of content, Google is, probably, not built into your DNA.
If there’s no search engine and you need a recipe or a pot, you visit cooking.com and they find you the best match ontheirsite. And it goes beyond web companies. If there’s no search engine and you need to buy coffee, you go to Starbucks.com, right? Leaders in every field had no reason to invent for search… it’s not good for them.
In fact, most market leaders still have websites,not web pages. A website is a place, a sticky collection/connection of web pages with a search field. A website is a place you want people to ""check back often and see what’s new"" and where people are either in or out.
I’ve gotten a bunch of invitations to feature my RSS feed on other people’s sites lately. At first, it feels a little weird… my content on your site. But then, once I get past issues re endorsement etc., it makes perfect sense. Because search and RSS have exploded the web. (Tip toDavid Weinberger, twice in one day).
It’s no longer an organic web filled with organisms or even a molecular one. It’s atomic. Each page on its own, each RSS drip its own entity.
The punchline is that you can wish all you want, it’s not going to make search go away.
Wishing is not much of a business strategy, and the realists among us will probably focus on three things:

Banging down the doors,"Finally, a sunny day. Did some errands, walked around the West Village and realized what a phenomenal cue queues provide. In other words, there must be a reason for that line.
Stew Leonard’s, a mere shell of its former glory as a groundbreaking supermarket, was so crowded that it was literally impossible to push the cart. After two aisles, I actually fled the store. Not such great prices, not such amazing selection, but thousands of people in the store. And the main reason, the best I could tell, was precisely because of how crowded it was. I know that I fell for it–I needed some fish for a party and told myself the story that it would be fresher there because of Stew’s volume. The person in front of me grabbing strawberries like they were scarce certainly agreed–even though they were precisely the same price as the market down the street.
Later, watching the party people lining up for a 2 pm brunch in New York… I don’t think it was an accident that people chose the source for their eggs benedict largely on how crowded the cafe was. A few places had huge lines. Some places had none. The menus seems awfully similar… and how different could the pancakes be? Those that wanted to feel the energy of community and scarcity knew just where to find it.
Remember when kids were willing to pay $200 for a Magic card or their parents $200 for an Elmo doll? Being popular can be its own marketing tactic. And no, I don’t think it’s a Catch-22.

But don’t measure THIS,"John Dodds responded to mypostabout measurement. So here’s some more: There’s no doubt that you should measure things that are both important and measurable. When you do, it’s inevitable that what you measure improves.
Caveat #1 isnotto measure things that aren’t important, just because they’re measurable. Business lore is rife with stories about companies that started measuring something… like defects to the last sigma… only to discover that people figured out that the best way to improve the measurement was to not make anything at all. Start measuring how long your operators stay on the phone, for example, and you’ll discover plenty of operators that just hang up on long-winded callers. Measuring the right thing is essential.
But caveat #2 is even more important: the art of business and organization is in realizing that there are important things you can’t measure. These ephemeral, soft things are the ones that often differentiate one organization from another, that lead to one company winning when all the metrics appear to be the same.
True story: I have a gig coming up, one that was planned a month or two ago. I went to book the tickets. First I went to Travelocity. Then, halfway through the process, decided to go straight to American to do it. Not sure why. Finished the reservation. Went to pay. Got a popup: can’t do that because the ticket has already been booked.
Amazing.
I had forgotten I had already booked the ticket (That part isn’t amazing. that happens all the time). No, what was amazing is that six weeks ago, I had gone through the same process, picked the same airline, the same flight times… exactly the same. Because of something you can’t measure, but is important nonetheless. And smart managers know how to invest in that too.",,"measurement, importance, business strategy"

Measure THAT,"One of the secrets of the Yellow Pages was that the phone company would give you a second line when you bought a big ad.
Within days of the book coming out, you’d see and hear the phone ring. And you knew which phone it was. So when the time came to renew your Yellow Pages ad, all the sales rep had to do was glance over at the phone on the wall and the prospect would imagine that phone no longer ringing…
Aaron writes in and asks, why is it so easy for a client to spend a fortune on a brochure and to spend hours agonizing over it, and so hard for them to invest in an end to permission marketing/ideavirus system?
The answer is the same: measure this, measure that.
Once the number is on the wall, in marker, or in phone calls or dollar bills, the investment will follow.
Example: Google adwords. The price of adwords keeps going up because the cost per click pricing model forces clients to measure. As soon as they measure something and see it is working, they want more. Magazine ads don’t have that effect, so companies rarely bid up the price.
Example: Indie musicians atcdbaby.They tour to make a living, and they obsessively track which gigs translate into record sales. As a result, they go back to the places and the types of venues that work, and stop going to the others.
So, my best advice is not to argue with the client about building a big kickass system. Instead, it’s to argue with them about measuring. Once they start measuring, they’ll be begging you for the big system.","April 5, 2006","measuring, advertising, investment"

Q: What sort of bonuses should we pay?,"A. ""It’s not about the money.""
Usually, when people say this, they are lying.
Except, it turns out, at work.
Money, it’s been shown time and time again, is a demotivator. I’m not talking about a fair or even generous salary. Being a cheapskate is no way to find a great employee. But once people have joined your team, incremental money–bonuses and the like–usually demotivate people. They demotivate because sooner or later, people feel as though they’re being treated unfairly.
One guy gets a $10 bonus. The person sitting next to him seethes for weeks, while the bonusee forgets it soon enough.
A sales rep gets into a fight about a commission… and remembers it long after the moment is gone.
People who really and truly love their jobs are in every single industry. And people who do great work because they love their jobs are paid at every salary level. What they have in common is a boss that gives them respect and freedom and responsibility. A boss that listens when they have something to say. Which, not coincidentally, is exactly the way the best companies treat their customers, too.
Cutting your prices doesn’t build customer loyalty, and paying a bonus doesn’t build employee loyalty.
If I had money to spend on a bonus, Mr. question writer, I would invest it in allowing each of my employees to try a small project (Google style) with no strings attached. Giving fairly-paid people your trust and the freedom to grow is worth a lot more than $50.

Marketing pothole (#2 of 3): I’m too busy,"I can count on one hand the number of marketers I know who get to do ""Marketing"" every day. (with a capital M).
Accountants do accounting all the time. Salespeople spent a lot of time selling. But marketers, it seems, have a long list of things they do (budgets, coupons, projections, photo shoots, bizdev meetings, meet and greets, etc.) that is technically marketing–cause I think everything an organization does is marketing–but is hardly in the sweet spot.
Think about the giant marketing successes of our time. From Disney to CAA to Boston Consulting Group… from Ronald Reagan to the Mormon Church to Habitat for Humanity… in every case, these organizations won big time because of a kernel of an idea, a marketing insight that they built upon.
There are more than 50,000 restaurants in New York City. Perhaps 200 of them are marketing success stories. Yet at the other 49,800 restaurants, the owners spend very little time working on their breakout idea, and tons of time doing stuff that feels a lot more important.

What I learned from eye tracking,"The folks atetrewere kind enough to do some eye tracking analysis of Squidoo. You can see the entire tape, unedited (but at slightly lower youtube resolution) here:

This is fascinating stuff. The blue dot shows you where the user is focusing her eyesite… it doesn’t measure peripheral vision, which is crucial. It reminds me of watching some bugs approaching food–or perhaps it’s a trap… The path is very jumpy, impatient, experimenting hither and yon.
You can see that some of the participants are slower, more linear readers, while others are jumping like mad, taking it all in.
I think websurfing is a hunting activity. The eye is looking for anamolies, for things that don’t belong. (That might be why the word anomaly, spelled wrong in the previous sentence, got your focus). Once our peripheral vision confirms that something is familiar, we can ignore it and just worry about the new stuff. Squidoo is stuffed with new stuff (nearly all our visitors are first-time visitors) and so, for example, there’s almost no focus on our Google AdWords. That’s because they’re familiar.
One of the takeaways is that bad web design might actually be a good thing! Slightly bad design isn’t familiar. It’s off. It demands attention. (Very bad design demands the ‘back’ button, of course). One of the reasons that experienced power tool users–like table saws–can still lose a finger is that they don’t pay attention… it’s too easy to turn the thing on and just use it.
The biggest lesson wasn’t news to me, but it might be to your boss: your prospects are not rational and organized and linear. You can’t count on them sitting still and hearing your story from beginning to end. They won’t.
The answer is not to try to change human nature. It’s to embrace the hunting skills that people are bringing online (and to their daily offline media consumption) and to make your media match their needs.",,"eye tracking, web design, user behavior"

Let’s say it’s Friday afternoon in Kansas City and you’re looking for live music… why isn’t there one place that shows it all, in various levels of granularity? Or I want to play in a pick up game of frisbee or maybe soccer somewhere within ten miles of my house…
If each venue published their schedule as an RSS feed, it seems trivial to put this together. I know, I know, you’re already working on it, but I wonder why no one has made the winner yet. This has ‘natural monopoly’ all over it.",,"Calendar aggregation, RSS feeds, event scheduling"
Marketing pothole (#1 of 3): I’ll know it when I see it,"Here is the first of three common pitfalls that wreck your marketing efforts:
Lots of marketers (and most of their bosses) like to say, ""I’ll know it when I see it.""
That’s why they want to see three or five or twenty executions of an ad. Or ten or fifteen mockups of a car or a facade. That’s why marketers put their staff and their freelancers and their agencies through an infinite loop of versioning.
""I’ll know it when I see it.""
Actually, you won’t.
You didn’t know it when you saw the first iPod or the first iteration of Google. You didn’t know it when first exposed to email or JetBlue or the Macarena or Britney Spears. No, in fact, you hardly ever ""know it."" If you did, you’d be a lot smarter than the rest of us, and we’d all be eagerly watching for your next product.
Whatistrue is that we often know success when it smashes us in the face. We didn’t ""know it"" when Google went public at $85 a share (did you buy shares with your house as collateral?) but we sure knew it when it hit $300.
Perhaps Clive Davis knows a hit song when he hears one, and certainly Giorgio Armani has the magic eye. But, just speaking for myself, I don’t have Clive’s ears or Giorgio’s eyes.
Marketing campaigns are frequently crippled by managers who are sure that they know ""it"" when they see it–and this isn’t it. Some of my favorite stories are the ones about all the naysayers who tried to kill the stuff that ends up being great.  They just didn’t know what it was.",,"Marketing pitfalls, decision-making, creative executions"
Just ten minutes,"Gene David writes a note about a simple idea: how being in sync with your market can change everything. He writes:
I am in Santa Elena, CR.  Off the map.  No paved roads by choice.  Few locals and lots of ecotourism (read tourist town which is really hard to get to).   If you like frogs, bugs, toucans, and zip lines through the rain forest, it is a great place.
There is one bus to the coast at 6am each day.  Mostly filled with tourists heading to surf or see the leather back turtles (I will be on it tomorrow).  Right across the street from the bus stop is a panaria (bread and roll shop), which opens at 6am.  Everyday 20 to 50 people who just scrabbled out of bed to make the bus on time.  Opening 10 minutes earlier would mean sales.  Just 10 minutes ealier.  I know I would buy.  I will buy tonight before heading to bed, but many more turistas will not have planned ahead.","May 29, 2006","market synchronization, ecotourism, sales opportunity"

Richard Feynman on marketing,"""Cargo Cult Science"" – by Richard Feynman.
I think the educational and psychological studies I mentioned are examples of what I would like to call cargo cult science. In the South Seas there is a cargo cult of people. During the war they saw airplanes with lots of good materials, and they want the same thing to happen now. So they’ve arranged to make things like runways, to put fires along the sides of the runways, to make a wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head to headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas–he’s the controller–and they wait for the airplanes to land. They’re doing everything right. The form is perfect. It looks exactly the way it looked before. But it doesn’t work. No airplanes land. So I call these things cargo cult science, because they follow all the apparent precepts and forms of scientific investigation, but they’re missing something essential, because the planes don’t land.
So, just because you copy the elements that apparently made something work before doesn’t mean that you’re going to be guaranteed that it will work again. In fact, given that we have no idea why some ideas spread and others don’t, the odds are that copying the headphones and the runways isn’t going to help you much at all.","May 28, 2006","Cargo Cult Science, Richard Feynman, Marketing"
Oopstr,"So, what should Firefox do? Here’s an idea:
Fixing broken urls since 2006
THE FIRST THING:Lots of people type the wrong thing into Firefox. When they do (like typing .con when you meant .com), they see this:
Oopstr can fix that. They can fix it by showing users a page with relevant recommendations and make it easy (with just one click) to find the thing they really wanted in the first place.THE SECOND THING:Lots of websites would like to reach people but are unable to get the right message in front of the right person at the right time. Well, the best time to give someone directions is when they’re lost. Make it easy for an advertiser to buy ads (through Google) or even better, to buy the whole page.
So, instead of seeing that useless error message, the surfer might see something like this:
THE THIRD THING:There’s a phantom net out there, an alternative reality that isn’t built around domain names. Instead, given the power of search and the browser, many organizations are profiting by grabbing traffic that isn’t heading for a specific branded URL. By leveraging the browser, Oopstr expands this opportunity dramatically.
For example, imagine a new virtual TLD like .safe. Type travel.safe and Oopstr takes over and suggests a number of relevant sites, all on a page paid for by a travel site.
The cool thing about this is that it can be organic and user driven. Once people start leaving breadcrumbs behind in Oopstr, other users can follow, seeing what the popular trails are.
THE TECHNOLOGY:Firefox knows what the person using the browser typed in that caused the error in the first place. They hand that information to oopstr, which compares it to a database of what previous lost searchers have typed in to correct themselves. They also use some common-sense algorithms—for example, replacing .con with .com.
Oopstr can quickly present the top seven matches, with the most common one set as the default. The user can click on any of them or type in a correction, which oopstr remembers and adds to the database.
This is the way computers are supposed to work. It’s not a test, after all. It’s a service, and if the computer knows what you want…
THE ADVERTISING:Every page carries Google adsense ads, which ought to have  higher-than-normal clickthrough and revenue numbers. Figure $2 per thousand as an average.
Each page is also for rent on a monthly basis. To rent a page, an advertiser gives oopstr a credit card and bids for the right to own all the ads in that column for a month. They set a minimum for each page based on what their Adsense revenue was in the previous month. Each month, the auction is redone, for each page. So, would you like to own traevl.com?
THE DEFAULT OPTION:Once oopstr demonstrates the technology works, Firefox can add this option to Firefox preferences:
This will enable users to skip the page that oopstr runs with ads by permitting them to give oopstr permission to automatically take them where they want to go in the first place.
The upside to the user is one-click surfing.
The upside to Oopstr is that they can now create useful new TLDs and sell them. Things like .safe and .shop and others can bypass the existing systems.
Hey, it’s an idea. Have a nice weekend.",,"Firefox, Oopstr, URL correction"
Fiddleheads,"Today at the Union Square Market, the maple syrup guy was selling fiddlehead ferns. No doubt they were wild, a special treat you find in the forest for a week or two. They were $6.50 a pound.
Two booths down, there was a farmer, also selling ferns. For a little less, as far as I could tell (his were by the pint). You could guess that each guy was disappointed that the other one existed… obviously, they think, if the other guy wasn’t selling fiddleheads, I’d be doing better.
In fact, that theory applies to every person at the market. Every booth imagines that it would be a lot better if they didn’t have to share the crowds with all the other booths.
Probably the same way at the mall, now that you think about it.
And online too, I guess.
Of course, this reasoning is fallacious. Without all the other booths/stores/websites, there are no crowds!
The power of the mall is that your competition is right next store. The magic of the web is not that you can somehow bait people to your site and entrap them. What’s becoming more clear every day is that the more you send people out, the wider open your door to the mall hallways is, the better you’re going to do.","May 26, 2006","Fiddleheads, competition, market dynamics"
The freeloader problem,"I wonder if there is one.
Here’s a guy at Starbucks who nicely consented to being photographed. You’ll notice that he’s eating a burger and fries and yes, a beverage, all from Mickey D’s. (that coffee cup on his table is a vestige from the last customer).
Except he’s not eating at McDonald’s. He’s eating at a very very busy Starbucks, a place where if the line is too long or there are no tables, people leave.
I asked him why he was eating at Starbucks, and he didn’t hesitate, ""It’s way nicer here.""
Are marketers  training an entire generation that there’s never a limit? That free music and free wifi and free ebooks and free lobby space isn’t just an inducement to pay attention, but is, in fact, a right?

Do apostrophe’s matter?,"You bet they do.
You might not care a bit about an apostrophe that modify’s the word incorrectly, but lot’s of people care. They care because it is an instantaneous method for determining whether the person writing is facile with the language and/or cares about doing things correctly.

Stories and my back,"A slow week for good posts, largely because I put my back into a week of spasms doing yoga (or as Fred would say:Yo! GAH!!.)
Some of you are already writing me mail, pointing out how great yoga is when done properly. You can stop. I know this. Of course, you are right. Of course it is also right that not all yoga is done properly, and that there is plenty within the canon that should probably be deleted.
What’s interesting is that the worldview of ""yoga is good/cool/right/mysterious/worthy/interesting"" is quite powerful. It’s ripe for storytelling, because so many people want to believe the stories. It’s a modern archetype, based on faith in a very old idea.
The easiest way to get a reaction is to tell a story that resonates with (for or against) a cherished idea. Change doesn’t always happen slowly. It tends to happen quickly in areas where people don’t care. In the areas where the worldview is widespread and the stories are durable, change is much more difficult.","May 25, 2006","yoga, storytelling, worldview"

Starbucks in the morning is a habit. So is having your law firm do a trademark search every time you invent a new name. Buying bottled water is a habit, but it didn’t used to be.
Making a habit is a lot easier than breaking one (ask a smoker) and habits often come in surprising ways (ask Jerry, who now has a manicure habit).

Please come June 15,"Not many more opportunities tosign upfor my all day seminar on June 15.
Because mydetail pagedidn’t do a great job of describing the benefits of the event, here you go:
For less than $667 a person (if you bring two friends) we’ll spend the day in New York City going over the new marketing, how it impacts your organization and what you can do about it. The first few hours of the day includes a very fast-paced overview of ideas from Permission Marketing, Unleashing the Ideavirus, Purple Cow, Free Prize Inside and All Marketers are Liars. The focus will be on laying out a framework that is easy to explain to your peers and your boss.
After that, the agenda is driven by the audience. Each person gets a chance to talk about her business or her website or a particular marketing issue. I address each of them, one by one, and the audience quickly gets the hang of a particular approach to problem solving (that would, ahem, bemyapproach). The goal is to get the group to the point where it’s really clear what to do before you even hear my riffs.
In the past, seminar attendees have included everyone from major inkjet printer companies to political candidates to non-profits. We’ve had giant companies from Chicago and one-person operations from South Korea. In just about every case, people leave energized–and send me notes a week or a month or even a year later about how their perspective was changed, and how it’s paying off.
The thrill for me is in assembling a group of people who believe they have little in common… and watching everyone in the room gradually ""get it"", realizing how the new marketing techniques change so many things in their organization. If I can do that, if I can send you home ready and able to grow fast if you want to, then it’s been a good day.
Seats are really limited, so if you want to come, please sign up soon. Not sure when the next one might be. Thanks.","May 23, 2006","Seminar, Marketing, New York City"
In search of better,"Every day, in almost every office of almost every organization, people are going to get together to make something better.
Making things better is a natural impulse, especially if you want to grow.
Unfortunately, better is not always the right strategy. Better is not always superior to different.
When you make something that works a little better, you’re playing the same game, just keeping up with the status quo. When you make something different, on the other hand, you’re trying to change the game.
The next time your engineers or customer service people want to initiate a project to make something better, challenge them to make something different instead.",,"innovation, improvement, strategy"
Overnight success?,"What’s the opposite of that? An Overnight failure?
The idea of an overnight success is relatively new. Joan of Arc, Robin Hood and Sarah Bernhardt were not overnight successes. It took media (the old kind, like TV and movies, and especially the new kind, like Google video) to create the overnight success. My friends Pomme and Kelly are overnight successes. So are some of the characters on American Idol.
Along the way, some people have trained themselves to believe that the only kind of success worth having is overnight success. That if you don’t hit #1 the first week, you’ve failed. That if your interface isn’t perfect out of the box, or if you don’t get 5,000 peoplestanding in lineat the opening of your new store, you’ve failed.
The Times today reports onKathleen McGowan, easily considered an overnight failure. She spent years researching and writing a novel. She went to the annual book convention on her own nickel last year, trying to pitch it. Day after day was spent slogging her way to any person willing to look at it. This year, of course, she’s back with a million dollar plus advance, feted by booksellers, the whole drill.
Squidoois another interesting case. Here’s a look at our daily traffic, courtesy of our Google Analytics package, since January (I removed four weeks in mid-March, mid-April, because of a glitch with search.)  Squidoo has more than 27,000 lenses built by 15,000 people in about five months. No, the chart doesn’t look like MySpace or Flickr. What it does look like is the early days of Google and Wikipedia and other overnight failures.
The challenge for observers, investors and partners (like the publisher who took on Kathleen) is to avoid the temptation of buying the media infatuation with the overnight success story (which rarely happens overnight). The challenge for marketers is to figure out what daily progress looks  like and obsess about that.
The goal, I think, is to be an overnight failure, but one that persists. Keeping costs low, building a foundation that leads to the right kind of story, the right kind of organic growth. Kathleen wrote a book that she believes in, one that was worth investing years of her life into. And then she painstakingly made progress until she became the next big thing.","May 22, 2006","Overnight success, persistence, organic growth"
478 Pete,"""More case studies,"" they say. Okay, here’s one:
Pete was in a business that’s a real commodity. Moving and storage. Mostly local. Anyone with a truck and some strong men can get in. It’s about price, mostly, plus service and ethics, I guess.
The thing is, most people don’t hire a mover very often. And when they do, they do it with fear and loathing, not excitement. The only thing that can happen is something bad.
So what did Pete do? He built aPurple Cow, one with a realstory.
Pete works for Metro North. He sold tickets at the train station in my town. Which means (pre credit card machine) that every single commuter knew him.
Pete got a phone number with a local exchange (478). Only people in town can get that exchange. They’re coveted.
And then he hired some nice guys. Not guys who had to be trained to be nice, but nice guys.
So, you see the trucks. The paint job is neat and clean. The firm’s name(478 PETE)isthe phone numberisthe storyisthe guarantee. Of course Pete’s not going to rip you off. He’d have to quit his great job at Metro-North to hide from you. Of course he’s local, he’s even got the exchange!
Bingo. Pete’s set for life.
Now, what usually happens at this point is that people say one of two things, ""Sure, that was obvious,"" and ""sure, it worked for him… but what about my particular unique one-and-only situation…""
Well, it’s not that obvious. And yes, if Pete can make local moving and storage into a goldmine, odds are you can reinvent your gig as well.

Lessons Learned from Trader Joe’s,"I was talking with a colleague today about the magic of Trader’s. Here’s how they make billions:
1.    they target a consumer that cares a great deal about what they buy at the supermarket. As a result, their customers are more loyal, and more important, are willing to drive farther to get there. This means they can have smaller, lower-rent locations (and fewer of them) which drives up sales per square foot and profits.
2.    These customers are big mouths. They sneeze. When they serve something from Trader’s they brag about, they tell the story of the store. This drives down advertising costs.
3.    Most of what they sell is private label. Now that they have scale, they are able to negotiate great prices from their suppliers, and more important, encourage/force their suppliers to make unique items, or organic foods, or foods of higher quality for the money. All of this is a virtuous cycle. The key mantra is thatTrader’s finds foods for its customers, NOT customers for its foods.
I think these three steps are viable for a wide range of businesses and sectors. One example to stretch your thinking: the TED conference. It’s in a remote location, one that’s probably a bit cheaper than some. People who care are happy to shlep. And they love to talk about it. And because the audience is so focused, the speakers come for free, further enhancing the cycle. If it works for supermarkets and high-end business conferences, where else does it work?","May 19, 2006","Trader Joe's, customer loyalty, private label"
#1 at the Box Office,"So, Tom Cruise devoted the last year of his life to promoting a movie that will be #1 in the US for exactly 14 days.
To be replaced by another movie, even more hyped than Cruise’s, that may just triumph for three weeks instead of two.
Lulu.comjust released a study of bestselling books. It turns out that in the last forty years, the length of stay of a typical bestseller at #1 is down by more than 85%. In other words, bestsellers used to be bestsellers forseven timesas long as they are now.
That’s an awe-inspiring figure.
Why?
Because the base of the pyramid is so much bigger (ten times as many books published every year, at least) you would expect that the winners would win bigger and longer to make it worth the journey. Not so.
And awe-inspiring because the effort necessary to get to #1 is far greater than it used to be. From co-op (bribes) to retailers for shelf-space and advertising to the extensive touring and cross promotion that’s necessary, it’s a lot more work and a lot more risk to get there.
Now, we’re seeing authors building permission assets and timing all their promotion so they can be #1 on Amazon for an hour—an hour! Allen Drury had a #1 bestseller for a year.
Of course, it’s not just movies and books. Just about any style-based business (and what business is no longer style based?) sees the same phenomenon. The lesson I draw is this:
If your marketing strategy requires you to hit #1 in order to succeed, you probably need a new marketing strategy.",,"bestsellers, marketing strategy, box office"

But is it CB Radio?,"If you’re over 40, you need to ask yourself the question, ""did you have a CB radio?""
Millions of Americans did. It was a classic craze disguised as a trend. CB radio made everyone into a broadcaster. CB radio allowed millions of people to communicate with each other–strangers and friends. CB radio changed the social network and the way we connect. CB radio even inspired a movie. And then it went away, right back to the truckers who brought it to us.
Geocities was CB radio. Geocities allowed anyone to build a free website. It grew fast and then boom. Same with online greeting cards.  Email, on the other hand, was not CB radio. Email, on the other hand, really did change (almost) everything.
And what about blogs? Are blogs CB radio or are they email?
Brad Feld has agreat postabout the first 25,000. This is the CB radio audience. Every once in a while, (more on the web than ever before anywhere else) the CB radio guys find something that gets bigger and more permanent. The art is in distinguishing one from the other, and investing early (your time, not just your money) in the platforms that are more likely to reach everyone else.

— Does your booth say anything about where to find the person I’mlooking for? Your publicity people, store events people, sales people,rights people, and executives all the look the same. They dress thesame, and they’re mixed throughout the booth. How hard do I have to workto meet someone I don’t know?
— Just as important, how hard do I have to work in your booth (and withyour takeaways) to discover something other than the obvious about yourlist? Does your booth say anything besides, ""We are a book publisher andthese are some of our big fall titles"" or ""proud publisher of these 37imprints""?
— Once again, just as important, does your booth say anything about whyyou’re at the show, and who you want to meet, and what you want to dowith them?
— Do you have a Wal-mart ""greeter"" to welcome me to your booth andtransmit a message to me before I leave? Do have welcome or exit signsin your aisles that tell me anything?

Three big barriers,"It’s not always the stories that we tell to prospects and consumers that matter. It’s often the stories we tell ourselves.
In talking with companies that are unhappy with the way they are growing, I find two common themes (and one a little less often):
You’ve certainly met people who have all three things taken care of. They approach a marketplace or a consumer with an appropriate amount of humility. They tell a story that is true, that they believe, that they live. And they do it with confidence, knowing that the story they are telling is bound to benefit most of the people who hear it.

And yet almost no one was working on the right stuff–the stuff that ended up working. Take a look at virtually every giant online success (except for Amazon) and none of them were obvious in 1992.

The rush to quality,"I just passed a house for sale. The sign out front was from a mass market realtor, but from their higher end ""estates"" division. A fancier sign, a fancier name.
It wasn’t, however, a fancier house.
In one industry after another, premium brands (Tiffany)are becoming the standard. Why list a house with a regular realtor? Why buy jewelry from a regular store? Why wear regular clothes? As brands learn how profitable it is to go from Class to Mass (Wolfgang Puck and Armani come to mind), consumers are being trained to abhor not the cheap but the middling.

Different kinds of traffic,"So, here’s your choice:You can have a billboard in Times Square (seen by 2 million people a day), or you can be the keynote speaker at the Allen & Co. annual millionaire media mogul retreat, listened to by about 150 people for an hour.
A no brainer? I hope so.
Of course, it’s not just the demographics. I think it’s the quality of the interaction.
Here’s acomparisonbetween two hot properties (MySpace and Facebook) and Amazon.
Should Jeff Bezos be in mourning? After all, MySpace is killing Amazon in traffic.
Of course, this is all irrelevant. Not surprising, but irrelevant. It’s not surprising because it’s just human nature to measure a simple metric, and to want to improve it. It’s human nature to believe that the more people get exposed to your idea, the better you’re going to do. It’s human nature to want to ‘win’, however you define winning.
The problem here is that Amazon users visit to buy stuff, and MySpace users visit to flirt.
Last time I checked, flirting was a fairly unprofitable activity.
There’s a long list of high-traffic sites (beginning with theglobe.com and extending to hotmail and many others) that couldn’t monetize. They were stuck because the bait that got them the traffic had no room for a reasonable hook. You could use a TV like model and interrupt with irrelevant ads, but it doesn’t work so well.
All a long, long way to say something simple:Whatever your website, I think you want better traffic, not more traffic.
You want to figure out why the right people will come, not build a sideshow that attracts exactly the wrong people.
At trade shows, there’s always a few booths with magicians, fire-eaters or bikini-clad models. And post-show, there’s no evidence at all to indicate that the noisy attractions did very much to improve the actual metrics of the booth.
So, maybe it doesn’t matter how your site does compared to a site in a different category. What matters, I think, is how your site does compared to last week or last month, and what’s happening to your conversion.","May 14, 2006","traffic quality, audience engagement, conversion metrics"
Top 1%,"Alex Krupp points us to this neat post from Jackie & Ben:Church of the Customer Blog: The 1% Rule: Charting citizen participation.
The upshot is that for many organizations, the top 1% do 80% more of the contributing. The fascinating Wikipedia example (fascinating for me, anyway) points out that after about three and a half years, Wikipedia had just 15,000 contributors. But 4,000 or so of them did almost all the work.
Often, it’s easy to imagine that big companies like Hallmark and British Airlines and Coke are selling lots and lots to everyone. In fact, a tiny slice may very well be the difference between success and failure.","May 14, 2006","1. Citizen Participation

How (some) people think about money,"Listening to Car Talk over the last few weeks, I’ve heard a similar refrain. Something like, ""my car is paid off so I’m ready to buy a new one."" Today, it was, ""We need to decide which car to sell–my husband’s or mine, because we need a minivan. But mine is paid off and his isn’t.""
Of course,a. when making the decision to buy a new car, it’s irrelevant that your old car is paid off. Just because you’ve finally paid it off doesn’t mean you should automatically go into debt again.b. and debt is fungible, so you can sell either car and pay off whichever debt you need to.

Barry Bonds,"Just got a phone call from someone in the UK. He was in Buffalo, NY, excited to share the news about a meeting he just left. This was the beginning of his breakthrough, he said. 400 stores around the country would be carrying his new product (up from zero). It was (about to be) a home run.
Except it hadn’t happened yet. He hadn’t gotten final approval from some executive that he hadn’t actually met yet.The home runs you almost hit don’t count.The home runs you almost hit don’t add up, they don’t accrue. As marketers, most of what we see are the home runs, the appearances on Oprah or the Facebooks of the world. The giant home runs that change everything.
Except that marketing success stories almost never happen that way. They happen on the back of singles, one after another. That’s how Wal-mart became Wal-mart and Boingboing became Boingboing.
Singles are less thrilling and require way too much work, but they build on each other. Over time, if you grow by 10 or 15% every week or month, you grow, reliably. And that steady growth transforms into every faster growth.
Any marketing plan that is nothing but a series of attempted home runs has a problem. The problem is that the odds don’t get better as you go along.","May 12, 2006","Marketing strategy, incremental growth, home runs vs. singles"

Silos,"Racquetball is a fast game because a ball shot in any direction rebounds and bounces off one wall after another.
Marketers often talk about silos with some disdain, because they represent disconnected thinking and broken communications networks. But silos are also like racquetball courts.
Because your idea is far more likely to bounce around, it’ll spread faster. Everyone inside the silo is going to learn about an important idea faster, precisely because they are inside the silo.

Want to guess what these musical acts have in common?

They each made more than $50 million last year, according to Forbes. They accounted for 40% of the top 10 acts.  The long trail is what happened.
Same with products like Quicken, websites like eBay and chefs like Wolfgang Puck.
We’re so busy celebrating the hit of the moment that we forget that the real profit often comes from the long trail.
It’s easy to persuade yourself to shortchange the design of a product, or your investment in its engineering, or to manipulate the launch to maximize the short-term box office appeal of opening weekend. But the long trail proves you wrong.
The web compounds long trail thinking. A website might spike with short term traffic hits, but a great website builds on its traffic, rises in its search rankings and continues to bring in traffic, year after year.
The long trail explains why so many unprofitable movies turn a profit when the DVD comes out. The Shawshank Redemption got seven Academy Award nominations when it was released, but disappointed at the box office. Now, after more than 1.3 million reviews at NetFlix, it is one of the most enduring DVD hits ever.

A properly run focus group is great. The purpose? To help you focus.
Not to find out if an idea is any good. Not to get the data you need to sell your boss on an idea.
No!
Focus groups are very bad at that. Groupthink is a problem, for one. Second, you’ve got a weird cross section of largely self-selected people, the kind of people willing to sit in a room with bad lighting to make a few bucks.
What focus groups can do for you is give you a visceral, personal, unscientific reaction to little brainstorms. They can help you push something farther and farther to see what grabs people. But the goal isn’t to do a vote or a census. Any time your focus group results include percentages, you’ve wasted an afternoon.","May 8, 2006","focus groups, groupthink, brainstorming"

But I like the sticky floors,"Alex Krupp asks about the McDonald’s redesign.
Sure looks like Starbucks. Will it work?
The other day, I walked into a Dunkin Donuts to buy a friend a muffin. There, in the center of the store, were six or eight seniors, clearly having been there for at least an hour. They were sitting in those classic DD plastic chairs, the kind that don’t move, and they were really enjoying themselves.
They had plenty of options, options that were virtually the same price or possibly even cheaper, but they like it there. Because that’s how it’s always been.
The challenge McDonald’s faces is not to be like Starbucks. Why? Because Starbucks isalreadylike Starbucks. The challenge is to to tell a story to the existing McDonald’s fan, a story that combines fresh and comfortable with the stuff they’ve always liked and trusted (the place is cheap, and it feels cheap, which makes it easier to bring the baseball team…)
The question, and I don’t know the answer, is how does a regular feel when she steps into the new store? Better? Worse? Good enough to bring a friend next time?

Average,"Okay, it’s true. In every category, in every profession, half the people are below average.

Mass marketing works best when it assumes that everybody in the entire chain is just plain average. Or even a little bit less. Sorry to lower your expectations.
Niche marketing, on the other hand, can thrive if it starts with the assumption that average products by average people for average people is just not your thing.

Please go away (angry),"If you’ve got more than one person in your organization, you probably have a policy or two.
And those policies have certainly made someone angry. Now what?
Yesterday, I ran into one of those policies at the cell phone store. Try as I might, I couldn’t get the clerk or his manager to see how ridiculous the policy was, or get them to show any ability to work with me on it.
So, the company gave me the following choices:a. admit that you are wrong and we are right and do business with us on our terms no matter how much it annoys you.
b. decide that compromising your principles or the way you want to do business isn’t worth it, decide that we are pathetic morons and leave angry.
Why would you only give your team these two options when dealing with prospects and customers?
The obvious answer is a lot more flexibility in the front line. But of course, that’s tricky and expensive and sometimes impossible. I think, though, that there’s an easier piece of first aid that every organization ought to install. It costs very little and it gives you another chance.
Give the team one more form. And here are the instructions:
When a customer is really upset about a policy or a procedure or something we did, and the only alternative appears to be telling them to go away angry, pull out this form. Explain (only if it’s true) that you are disappointed that they’re upset. Explain (if it’s true) that you agree that the policy is stupid and doesn’t make sense in their case.
Then, working as a team, write up the situation. Work WITH them, egging them on. Get all the details on this form, let them explain to you and to themselves what the problem is. Get their contact info.
When you’re done, thank them for helping you (it’s true, they are helping you!), then fax the form to the CEOs direct fax number.
No, the person won’t get satisfied that minute. But they won’t leave angry, either.

"So, what’s wrong with small business?","Erik Severin points us toWho Do You Want to Be When You Grow Up?The essence, I think, is that entrepreneurs think big thoughts and do big things, while small business owners settle, working their way through the day to day.
The distinction I’ve always made is that an entrepreneur is trying to make money while she sleeps, and does it with someone else’s money! That she builds a business bigger than herself, that scales for a long time, that is about processes and markets. A small businessperson, on the other hand, is largely a freelancer with support, someone who understands the natural size of her business and wants to enjoy the craft of doing it every day.
The more I see both, the happier it appears that small business people are. They often make more money, take fewer risks, sleep better and build something for the ages, something they believe in and can polish and be proud of.
Growth for growth’s sake makes less sense every day.

"Black, white and grey","When I was growing up, most marketers wore a white hat.
White hat marketers have jingles. They buy TV commercials. They tell the truth about what they sell and how they sell it. They offer a money-back guarantee and honor it. They belong to the better business bureau and to the Lion’s Club. White hat marketers donate money to charity because it’s the right thing to do. They build long-term relationships with people and with organizations. They belong to associations. They go to trade shows and have big booths staffed with struggling models, often in bathing suits. They offer a free bonus–and clearly state what you have to do to earn it. They have a sales force that sticks around.
Lately, there have been a bunch of black hat marketers in our lives. One firm offered to put my new book on the bestseller lists–not by selling more, but by manipulating the system. Many websites manipulate the search engines to rank higher. Companies are organized around spamming people. Firms hire squads of clickers in the developing world to boost their income or to punish their competitors. They say they are giving away something but are really harvesting names. There are rings of people who trade links to influence their Alexa rankings. Squadrons of fraudsters work the eBay universe, just barely staying a step ahead of the system.
It’s a slippery slope. Is it okay to vote for your site a million times in an online poll? What about encouraging your readers to vote for you a million times? Digital systems have so much leverage that sooner or later, a line gets crossed.
I worry that it’s inevitable that black and white are mixing. That brands we trust send out spam, but call it a legitimate use of their privacy policy. That they hide the results of this test or that ruling because the law permits it. I worry that their webteam is under so much pressure to deliver results that just a little black hat SEO feels just fine. It’s easy to shade your accounting and even easier to lie about your online presence.
Online, where a bit is a bit, where no one knows you’re a dog, where a big company looks just like someone in their garage… sometimes the people who succeed the most are the ones acting the way we’d least like them to.

Okay, I thought, I’m a marketer.  I can kind of understand and accept this, even though it absurdly ""required"" that I provide my income level and gave no option to decline.  I completed the survey and……… was taken to a page notifying me that I’d have to pay a $1 ""administrative fee"" to the photo fulfillment company, Foto Fetch.  That would have been a deal breaker but my kids really wanted the photo.  I tracked down my wallet for my credit card, typed in all my personal data and got the photo.
My good feelings toward USA Today after this experience — gone.  Wiped clean.  The quid pro quo that I expected — me receiving a photo from the good folks at USA Today in exchange for possibly having some branding on the photo frame or receiving a special subscription offer — was instead a complete rouse. The file folder in my brain titled ""USA Today"" now has a sticky note on it with a sad face.""  [end of story…]

A lesson learned at the mall,"Retailers that spend on real estate, win.
The most expensive real estate in my county is a mall filled with stores. And those stores are jammed with shoppers. Almost none of them fold, none of them appear to be struggling. Almost all of them are expensive.
Two blocks away, independent stores, stores that cheaped-out on their real estate investment, those guys are struggling.
Well, you’re not in retail, maybe, or you’re virtual, so what difference does this make to you?
Question: what’s your ""real estate""?
For most of us, it’s people.
Expensive people are just like expensive real estate. If you invest in them, you may just find they pay off. Some businesses work as hard as they can to pay people as little as they can (witness the fights over the minimum wage). What sort of growing business wants the minimum wage? If your business is people-based, as opposed to machine-based, why wouldn’t you want people who command more than the minimum?","June 25, 2006","real estate, investment, workforce"
Shiny and deep,"The most successful marketers tell two stories at the same time. A shiny one and a deep one.

ConsiderThe Bob Dylan Encyclopedia.It’s more than 800 pages long. Dylan is shiny (sometimes). His songs get played on the radio or around the campfire. It’s not unusual for a teenager to hear an old Dylan song for the very first time and then add it to her iPod.

Spammers are short-sighted and selfish, and don’t care what they wreck. It’s the enemy of anything open. Once again, just like with email and with comments, the answer is reputation. Get rid of anonymity or at the very least, track reputation over time. When reputable people speak up, it should count for more than when a stranger does. That’s the way it works in the real world, right?

Changing everything (again),"Ederpoints us tothis postabout CPA ads from Google.
Bottom line: in addition to buying clicks from Google, you can now bid onactions. Meaning sales, or sign ups. An action is worth 100 or 1,000 times as much as a click, so this means that a huge amount of the marketing risk is being transferred from the advertiser to Google or the affiliate.
A thoughtful profit-maximizer would buy every single bit of available inventory. Why not?
The challenge is thus on inventory. With such a low production rate (only one in ten thousand or a hundred thousand impressions pay off), the ads are more like lottery tickets for a typical website. The next step will be landing pages that are optimized for these actions. Example: company X does a bad job converting, so they start buying CPA ads. They pay, say, $100 an action. But media company Y figures out an efficient way to convert people. So they build pages that do this for say $50 each. They can scale and make money all day long being in company x’s business… without the pesky overhead.
Should happen pretty quickly.","June 21, 2006","CPA ads, marketing risk, conversion optimization"
Time to quit?,"TheCowenGroup reminds me of this piece I wrote about five years ago:
I just got back from lunch with my friend Doug Jacobs.
Doug just got another promotion. He works for a software company in Indiana, and over the last 14 years, he’s had a wide range of jobs. For the first seven or eight years, Doug was in business development and sales. He handled the Microsoft account for a while, flying to Redmond, Washington, every six weeks or so. It was hard on his family, but he’s really focused — and really good.
Two years ago, Doug got a huge promotion. He was put in charge of his entire division — 150 people, the second-biggest group in the company. Doug attacked the job with relish. In addition to spending even more time on the road, he did a great job of handling internal management issues.
A month ago, for a variety of good reasons, Doug got a sideways promotion. Same level, but a new team of analysts report to him. Now he’s in charge of strategic alliances. He’s well-respected, he’s done just about every job and he makes a lot of money.
So, of course, I told him to quit.
“You’ve been there a long time, my friend.”
Doug wasn’t buying it: “Yes, I’ve been here 14 years, but I’ve had seven jobs. When I got here, we were a startup, but now we’re a division of Cisco. I’ve got new challenges, and the commute is great –”
I interrupted him before he could go on. I couldn’t help myself.
Doug needs to leave for a very simple reason. He’s been branded. Everyone at the company has an expectation of who Doug is and what he can do. Working your way up from the mailroom sounds sexy, but in fact, it’s entirely unlikely. Doug has hit a plateau. He’s not going to be challenged, pushed or promoted to president. Doug, regardless of what he could actually accomplish, has stopped evolving — at least in the eyes of the people who matter.
If he leaves and joins another company, he gets to reinvent himself. No one in the new company will remember young Doug from 10 years ago. No, they’ll treat Doug as the new Doug, the Doug with endless upside and little past.
Let’s look at it from the perspective of evolution: Species that evolve the fastest are the ones that don’t mate for life. By switching mates, swapping genes with someone new, you continually reshuffle the gene pool, making it more likely you’ll create something new and neat and novel and useful.
Our parents and grandparents believed you should stay at a job for five years, 10 years or even your whole life. But in a world where companies come and go — where they grow from nothing to the Fortune 500 and then disappear, all in a few years — that’s just not possible.
Here’s the deal, and here’s what I told Doug: The time to look for a new job is when you don’t need one. The time to switch jobs is before it feels comfortable. Go. Switch. Challenge yourself; get yourself a raise and a promotion. You owe it to your career and your skills.
No word back from Doug yet. How about you?

Googling prospects,"I got a cold call on my cell phone yesterday. Someone was looking for me, trying to sell me something. Typical cost of a call like this (not from a boiler room)–perhaps $100 when you add it all up.
When I explained to the person what I did and where I did it, she realized that I had no interest at all in what she had to sell and politely hung up.
She followed up by email asking for a referral and I asked her why she didn’t Google me before calling. Her answer, (ellipses are hers) ""It depends…  you came recommended by more than one source (confidentially).  If I trust someone I make the call right away…  if someone is interested in talking, then I dig deeper.""
So, it’s okay to waste my time (and by extension, hers) and she’ll do some research after she’s got a warm lead.
Ouch.
Twenty seconds in Google would have saved both of us a lot of time. More important for her, that twenty seconds could have turned a ""no"" call into a decent shot at a referral.",,"Cold calling, prospect research, referrals"
SEO: Passive vs. Active,"A lot of search engine optimization writing passes by my desk, and I don’t think I’ve ever seen a simple distinction made.
PASSIVE SEO is the idea that you can do things to your site (metatags, phrases, even the articles you choose to write) that will be warmly received by the search engines. As we all know, the best passive strategy is to make great stuff, but beyond that it’s pretty clear that architecting your site properly is smart. There are peoplefar betterat this than I am.
ACTIVE SEO is the act of going outside of your site to build other sites (blogs, Squidoo lenses, delicious tags) or influence other sites (links and directories) to point to you. Not justyoudoing it, of course, but your readers and fans and employees as well. I wrote an ebook about part of this  (download for free:flippingpro.pdf).
There’s no doubt that these two activities need to be closely coordinated. But I’m not sure they should be done by the same person. Sometimes, dividing a task increases your ability to get it done…
[updated]Peter Bellwrites in to amplify:
In the SEO industry, it’s often referred to as ""on page"" vs. ""link building"".
Not only should on page and link building be done by different people, on page should also be divided between technical and content.
A technical person should follow best coding practices to optimize site tags (including proper use of CSS and headers) for SEO (and accessibility). It’s about 2-8 hours of work to redesign most site templates and then whatever it takes to load that into your content management system.
A writer and/or subject domain expert should create the great content to drive traffic.
A top SEO guru should ADVISE you on how to do the link building with the latest hints and tips (2 hrs at $300/hr – high rate, low hours).
Someone between your sales/marketing team, an intern and a college kid in Vilnius should then actually implement the various recommendations depending upon the skills required for each.",,"Passive SEO, Active SEO, Link building"

And no, it doesn’t matter if the swordfish is ""Atlantic"" or ""Pacific"". Yet another clever modifier. My current favorite is ""Ahi"" tuna, a cool word that describes a less desirable kind of tuna!

The spreading paradox of Broadway,"It costs many millions of dollars to open a Broadway show. If it doesn’t run for months or years, investors get creamed.
Yet one or two bad reviews can crush a show, impacting attendance so seriously that it never recovers.
The obvious answer is to make a show review proof. You do this by intentionally scheduling a short run and stocking the play with big stars.
Big stars, though, likely require you to modify the show so that it’s not so good–at least not so good by Broadway standards. (Julia Roberts is a star, her show was not well respected). Result: You sell a lot of tickets (in fact, The Odd Couple sold out before it opened). You are review-proof. And you train the audiences who attend that Broadway shows aren’t so great.
The new Superman movie will cost more than a fifth of abilliondollars to make. Perhaps the same strategy will cross their mind?

The death of the sales call?,"I wonder if the sales call has a lot of life left in it.
Before you faint, let me get my terms straight: I think a sales call is a meeting (in person or on the phone) when a salesperson endeavors to sell something to a prospect, and where the prospect is doing the salesperson some sort of service by being there.
Today, though, with streamlined organizations, there are plenty of people who no longer have the time to politely listen to a sales call in order to not offend a b2b salesperson.
And with so many shopping options available, I’m not sure many consumers have the time or desire either.
Instead, I think we’re seeing the rise of thebuyingcall.
I have a problem. I’m willing to talk to a buyperson (okay, bad neologism) to help me solve it.
My factory needs to be more efficient. I want to buy a solution. I call a salesperson.
My publishing company needs to grow. I’m eager to have a meeting with an author who will show me a new book that will help me do that.
What changes more than the words is the posture. If you ever find yourself in a meeting, arms folded, barely paying attention, waiting for the salesperson to leave, the right question to ask yourself is, ""Why did you bother wasting your time by going?"" If you’re going to go to a meeting with a salesperson, the new expectation is that you’ll come armed with questions, eager to learn what you need, ready to buy the moment you find the right solution.
An unprepared salesperson should be shown the door. What about an unprepared or unmotivated buyer?

Welcome to the lightning round,"It was always the best part of the game show. No buzzers, no banter, just as many questions as you can answer in a minute. Quick.Quick.Quick.
Well, now that we’ve got a billion-channel universe (with more than 300 hits on the ‘top ten’ hit list:popurls.com | popular urls to the latest web buzz) it’salwaysthe lightning round. There are hundreds of the most important posts of the day, and the list changes constantly.
Which means that subtlety may seem dead.
You get judged by your headline or your layout, or the first line of your press release or the first beats of your riff. If the smartmob can’t figure out your story in two seconds, they ignore it or they make up their own.
If you want to please everyone, it helps to be clear, obvious and direct. And safe and predictable as well.
Of course, if you try to make it clear to everyone, the chances of having your story spread in the long run go down. Because direct is often not so interesting, especially to sneezers. And doesn’t always involve the joy of discovery.
So perhaps, the best strategy is to be a bit less obvious, a bit indirect, telling a story you can live with because it’s true, but a story that might take more than a minute to understand.
I actually think there’s room in this big world for both approaches. They rarely meet (Google’s did, I think–the simple search story was right there for everyone to see, while the more subtle elements unfolded over time) so if you try to do both at the same time, you’ve got your work cut out for you.
A lot of internal marketing conflict comes from camps that don’t have the words to describe which path they’re choosing. Being clear with your peers in what you hope to accomplish will help you roll it out. Of course, being subtle…",,"lightning round, storytelling, marketing strategy"
This one I don’t get,"Seen on a truck in Elmsford, NY.
Does the sign mean:
Is this a big problem for this particular truck or for all trucks?
The whole thing feels almost existential.Truckers, feel free tolet me know.
[So, here’s what people think: Trucks are more likely than some vehicles to throw back items they run over (one reader was almost killed by a shovel). This driver works for a company that would rather fight than settle. So, the sign is a double warning–don’t drive close (to all trucks, not just this one) AND if you ignore the sign, don’t bother calling us. Oh. Actually, this isn’t true. See below.]

The thing about coupons,"Coupons are a surprisingly subtle invention. Now that anyone can offer them (because now anyone can have a store), it’s worth a second to think about what they’re for.
First benefit to the marketer is that coupons allow you to offer different prices to different people.
There’s a reason that most coupons are not trivially easy to find or redeem. By trading effort for a discount, the marketer says, ""if you care about price, I’ll sell it to you cheaper, but you have to prove it."" Hence the original idea behind Priceline. It was intentionally awkward to use so that the airlines could be confident that only the fare-obsessed would use it.
""Outlet"" malls are just coupons in disguise. There’s a reason that Armani doesn’t have an outlet store on Fifth Ave. in NY. The drive is your way of proving you’re serious about price.
The second benefit is that they provide the shopper with a totem. Paper coupons are best, but even digital codes work. With something tangible in hand, the shopper feels as though they have the power to go make an exchange. It’s not just about trading money for the object or service. It’s about trading in this thing I have in my hand (or pasted onto my clipboard). If I don’t buy the thing, I’ve just lost the value of my totem. Now the purchase isn’t just about spending money… it’s about realizing the value of a thing I possess–or losing it forever.
Which leads to the third benefit: a coupon can meannow.Give me a coupon and I am forced to make a decision. Will I buy the service or product before the coupon expires or gets lost, or should I forfeit this thing of value?
Three benefits from one tool–and two caveats.
The first: don’t do a coupon unless you can execute properly. It needs to be big enough matter. It needs to avoid alienating the middleman (retailer) if that’s not you. And it can’t destroy the product and what it stands for. No coupons for high-end plastic surgeons, please. Why? Because those that don’t want to use the coupon might see it, and its very existence means the surgeon is no longer who you thought they were. No coupons for Tiffany’s either.
The second: if you make the use of the coupon a hassle, you’ve blown it. Barbeques Galore lured me in with a 10% off coupon. Yes, I’m a cheapskate, but it was the totem that got me to go do something I’d been meaning to do anyway. It took me two minutes to find the item I was replacing. I handed them the coupon, picked out some overpriced accessories and stood as they wrote up the whole thing.
The clerk handed me the receipt, and I asked, ""Where’s the discount? It seems to be missing."" The manager walked over and said that the coupon wasn’t valid because the grill was on sale.
Well, sure, that’s their privilege, but:They didn’t tell me, I had to askThe coupon said no such thingThey didn’t even apply the coupon to the non-on-sale other stuff.
No budging on their part, I finished my transaction and went home.
So, the smart marketer used the coupon properly. The short-term minded sales ops team decided that they could boost profits by alienating the very people the marketer lured in. One more reason that the marketer needs to be responsible for the whole chain.
The best thing about coupons in the post-newspaper insert era is that they are trivially easy to test and practically free to distribute.
PS Bryan Murley points out the other key benefit of coupons… they make it easy to track the media. That’s why newspapers embraced them early on. Proof! Now, of course, they make it easy for you to see what’s working and what’s not. Thanks, Bryan.",,"coupons, marketing, consumer behavior"

Why I don’t have comments,"Judging from the response to my last post, some of my readers are itching to find a comment field on my posts from now on. I can’t do that for you, alas, and I thought I’d tell you why.
I think comments are terrific, and they are the key attraction for some blogs and some bloggers. Not for me, though. First, I feel compelled to clarify or to answer every objection or to point out every flaw in reasoning. Second, it takes way too much of my time to even think about them, never mind curate them. And finally, and most important for you, it permanently changes the way I write. Instead of writing for everyone, I find myself writing in anticipation of the commenters. I’m already itching to rewrite my traffic post below. So, given a choice between a blog with comments or no blog at all, I think I’d have to choose the latter.

Marketing pothole (#3 of 3): What will the boss think,"This is the biggest one, and the reason for the whole series.
I now believe that almost all marketing decisions are first and foremost made without the marketplace in mind.
That’s a pretty bold statement, but here goes.
I think that most marketers, most of the time, make their marketing decisions based on whatthey thinkthe committee, or their boss, or their family or their friends or the blog readers with email will say.
When I speak to groups, the folks who are stuck, or who are not finding the growth they are hoping for, rarely say, ""we don’t know how to get the market to respond."" Instead, they say, ""my boss or the factory or the committee or the design folks or the CFO won’t…""
Now, of course most of this is whining. Most of this is nonsense. It’s not everyone else’s fault. But that’s not my point. My point is that if you market intending to please those people, you only have yourself to blame.
Great marketing pleases everyone on the team, sooner or later. But at the beginning, great marketing pleases almost no one. At the beginning, great marketing is counter-intuitive, non-obvious, challenging and apparently risky. Of course your friends, shareholders, stakeholders and bosses won’t like it. But they’re not doing the marketing, you are.","June 2, 2006","Marketing, Decision-making, Leadership"
Tabasco,"I’m a little obsessed with the Tabasco story.
First thing: people have a bottle of Tabasco in their house and in their restaurant. It solves their ""hot sauce problem"". If someone asks for it, you’ve got some. This is a very good thing for the Tabasco people.
Second thing: people only buy more Tabasco when they run out of it. Which doesn’t happen so often, at least in most blue states. Replenishment only is not as good as people buying something because they like buying it.
And the third thing, the biggest change, is that there are now thousands of brands of hot sauce, many of which are far better than Tabasco, and millions of people are buying not one flavor, but several. And they buy more varieties because they want to, not because they have to.","June 2, 2006","Tabasco, hot sauce, brand variety"
Being brave with names,"Mark Ramsey is usually right. This time he’s wrong, twice.""Podcasting"" has a bad name.
Mark says ""podcasting"" is a bad name, and that something understandable, like ""audiomag"" would be better, because more people would know what it is.
I guess TV should have been called ""pictureradio"".
Not only is podcasting one of the great names of our generation, but it could have been even braver, not less brave. If you’ve going to invent a new product that is more than just an incremental improvement, then that new product requires a new slot in the mind, a new way of thinking. Giving it a name that permanently links it to old thinking doesn’t help. ""Sneakers"" is better than ""athletic shoe"".
Sometimes, you’re able to come up with a name that manages to be incremental to a tiny, very influential portion of the population and just strange to the rest of us. So, in this case, ""pod"" referred to iPod–but just to the 5% of online techies that were instrumental in spreading the word in 2004 (two very long years ago). In other words, the architecture of the name perfectly matched the vector the word needed to travel to make it. Compare that to the brave but foolish ""RSS."" (Really Stupid Slogan).
Sure, ""email"" couldn’t be anything but email, and that was a pretty chicken name. But in general, if you need people to think differently, it helps to be brave when you name something new.","June 1, 2006","podcasting, naming, innovation"
Dreams,"Ramit asked:What’s easier now than later?
Dreaming was easier.
First, it was easier to sleep, but that’s an entirely different story.
I meant real dreams. Visions. Ideas of what was around the corner. I still do it, I push myself to do it, I work at it and it pays off. But in my 20s, it just happened. And I wrote em down. Writing your dreams down is a great idea.","July 31, 2006","dreams, visions, writing"
"Yes, but how do you search for that?","Over the last four years, search has changed the way we interact with the world. Just like you can’t remember what life was like before email, you’re probably having trouble remembering what you did before Google became a verb.
It’s easy to believe that search is mature, and the next big thing is going to be somewhere else. Actually, we’re about 5% done.
Example: What if I want to find a place to take 6 friends for a midweek retreat, near a lake, within an hour of my house. I knowwhenI want to do it, I know about how much I want to spend, but I don’t know where. I don’t know if I want a private house for rent, or a condo or a hotel. I don’t know if it’s in Massachussets or New Jersey.
This is actually the way many people plan a trip like this one. If I do perhaps 75 online searches, I’ll start getting close to what I want.
Or what if I want to have a business meeting in Los Angeles in September. I know how many people, and approximately where the venue needs to be, but that’s it. It doesn’t matter a lot if it’s a private loft, a hotel or a restaurant. Gigs like this get planned all the time.
Or what if I need a new CRM system for my office…
If you’re a seller of that sort of accomodation, you’d love to know about me, no doubt.
So, how do we find each other?
No website is going to be able to aggregate all of the providers if it requires either a payment or incremental effort–it’s just unreasonable to expect that you’ll get the entire universe in any category to affirmatively sign up for something. It needs to be more passive than that. But it also needs to be incredibly intelligent to sort the junk from the good stuff.
So far, the most ubiquitous solution is Craig’s List, and while it’s a miracle, it’s not the answer.

Better than they deserve,"At eight o’clock tonight, the best restaurant in Grand Cayman was deserted. Just two diners, chowing down on an astonishing whole red snapper, caught several hours before by a local fisherman.
Jindi, the owner of the Thai Restaurant in Georgetown, explained to me that they’ve been there for fifteen years and lunch pays the rent. ""Every day, lunch is very busy… it’s the cruise ships,"" she explained.
Imagining a stream of classic cruise ship turistas invading her restaurant every day made me shudder. The restaurant does well at lunch because it has the perfect location for cruise ships (three blocks from the dock–exactly far enough way to seem exotic). Then I looked over the restaurant and realized that for more than a decade, Jindi has refused to compromise her standards. There are dozens of dishes that would disappear if she was only catering to the lunch crowd. Do the bulk of her customers care about her home-grown thai basil and lime leaves? There are preparations and ingredients that cost her a fortune, and it’s clear why she’s doing it. Not for the bulk of her customers, but for herself, for her staff and for the chowhounds she encounters at random.
Jindi’s refusal to compromise is yet another reason she’s doing so well at lunch, actually. Because taste is starting to catch up with her. People are now ordering the items she would have deleted ten years ago.
And in a connected world, it’s much easier for the chowhounds to leave a digital trail of breadcrumbs to her door.
Letting your customers set your standards is a dangerous game, because the race to the bottom is pretty easy to win. Setting your own standards–and living up to them–is a better way to profit.

Marketers and money,"Money is the enemy of most entrepreneurs and marketers. Actually, that’s not true. The search for money, the need for money and the desire to spend the money you have are the enemy.
From movies (Superman vs. Syriana or WordPlay) to coffee (Maxwell House vs. Starbucks) to technology (Microsoft vs. a kid in a room in Germany) we see it over and over again.
First rule: great product development and marketing almost always comes from organizations that don’t have enough money. Having less money keeps you from trying to buy your way out of trouble.
Second rule: learning to live with less money means you will develop skills and resources instead of buying them. And it means that when you have less money (again), you’ll be prepared.
Third rule: When you need money for something specific, go get it. But just for that. With good terms. As soon as you spend money to protect your money or leverage your money or account for your money or send a message about your money, the money is not only wasted, it hurts you.","July 27, 2006","money, marketing, entrepreneurship"
The intuition vs. analysis conundrum,"Let’s say you’ve got a really good idea. And you’ve had good ideas before.
You show it to your colleagues. They analyze it. They tell you why it’snota good idea.
Hmmm.
Do you go with your instinct? Is your gut reaction to be trusted? After all, you’ve been right before. After all, you’ve been wrong before.
The analysis, based on past events, certainly seems sound. But your instincts are the only way you’re going to do somethingunsound.
And unsound things become hits. Sound ones never do.
Who Moved My Cheese was unsound. So was publishing a book two years after you started blogging every chapter. So was an expensive, unfitted, almost untailored suit from Milan. So was running against Joe Lieberman.
The challenge is not to somehow persuade those in search of soundness to change their minds. The challenge is to do enough of a gut check to decide whether you should defend your instinct. And then do it.","July 26, 2006","intuition, analysis, decision-making"

Marketing matters,"Yes, marketing works. The Saturday Journal writes about Michelle Nimmons, who runs the Denmark-Olar Teen Life Center in Denmark, SC. She and her staff (using nothing but marketing techniques like billboards, classroom sessions, free dinners and condom distribution) have cut the teen pregnancy rate by more than 60%. It’s now, by far, the lowest in the state, a fraction of the rate in the next county.
Most marketing problems aren’t intractable. They are solved with persistence, consistency and attention to detail. When marketing doesn’t work, it’s usually because the product is lousy. But the second reason is that the organization picks too big a marketplace in comparison to the resources they have available. I have no doubt that if Michelle tried to do her work in the entire state (with the same staff), she’d fail.

Factor L,"Another re-run, this one from 2004:
Why do some products and services succeed while others fail? Why dosome ideas go viral, rocketing across the marketplace, while otherswither and die in obscurity?
It’s not the quality of the ideas. Go take a look at X1 (www.x1.com).Here’s a really cool utility that can instantly search all your email(I have more than 150,000 on file from the past six years) to find anyword. This Google for your hard drive works pretty well, and it’scheap. The Web site is really well done, too. The reviews are good. Thetrial is free. But do you have it installed? Probably not. Most of the162 million Internet users in this country don’t. I wonder why.
On the other hand, consider ""Baby Boy,"" the top-10 hit by Beyonce.She certainly has talent, but is this the very best song from the verybest album by the very best singer in the world? It’s been a hit forweeks. I wonder why.
What, precisely, is going on here? I have no idea. You don’t, either.
We’d all love to know the series of steps to follow, the calculus weneed to run, the hoops we need to go through in order to launch aproduct or service that is guaranteed to succeed. It would save us alot of angst and disappointment if we could put our hearts and soulsinto something with a reasonable expectation of success.
It used to be that way, of course. If you had a very good productand a fairly sophisticated ad campaign (and enough money to keep bothof them going), you could buy attention and turn it into market share.Creating new products was largely about having the will (and the means)to get your market to sit up and notice.
Today, it feels like more of a crapshoot.
What is it about Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, for example, that suddenlyturned them into a profitable fad–and then a phenomenon? Sure, they’regood, but are they that much better than Dunkin’ Donuts? Friendster,the online social networking service, is the latest viral rage. Itrecently turned down a chance to be acquired by Google for $30 million.Just a few years ago, though, SixDegrees.com was offering almostprecisely the same service, and it’s no longer on the radar.
MoveOn.org has more than 1 million subscribers, while otherpolitical sites struggle. Some politicians catch fire; others (witharguably better records) never gain traction.
It’s easy to call the game after it’s over. It’s easy to explainwhat the market liked about product X. The hard part, of course, isdoing it in advance. I don’t think we can. I don’t think you shouldeven try.
Sure, you should work hard to maximize your chances of capturing theimagination of your market. But all you can do is all you can do. Afteryou’ve done that, you should stop tweaking.
The L factor is about luck. And as any gambler will tell you, youget to keep playing until your money runs out. After that, you don’tget any more chances to win.
As our marketplaces have changed, our approaches haven’t. We stilloverinvest to ensure success. We still make sure we have just a feweggs, in just one basket, and then we watch that basket really closely.Big mistake.
We live in a world of fashion, not rational computation. A worldwhere everything from brake linings and ball bearings to clothes andairlines is chosen for unpredictable reasons.
The way to grow in the future is to acknowledge how important luckis and to diversify your risk. Do that with lots of products, not justone or two. Cut your overhead so you have plenty of chips, ready foranother spin of the roulette wheel.
Take the case of Levi Strauss & Co. This company was lucky,plain and simple. It makes a garment that was the clothing of choicefor a generation of free-spending consumers. But instead of recognizingthe luck, Levi imagined it was smart branding, or its employmentpolicies or even its ad agency that had somehow enabled it to grow.Once the luck ran out (and it always does) Levi shrank fast. In justsix years, sales dropped more than 30%, and every U.S. factory wasclosed.
Every time you launch a product or service, every time you apply fora job or start a nonprofit, you’re either going to hit or not. If youget lucky, you’re entitled to deny that luck had anything to do withit. But if you fail–and you probably will–understanding the role ofthe L factor will keep you sane. And if you’ve planned for it, it willkeep you solvent as well. Solvent enough to try again and again, untilyou make it (and take all the credit).","July 24, 2006","success, luck, market dynamics"
How to give feedback,"Golden oldies week on the blog. All fromSmall is the New Big.Blog readers are far more likely to be askedfor their input than the average employee. You’re frequently requiredto approve, improve, and adjust things that are about to become real.And yet, if you’re like most people, you’re pretty bad at it.
In the interest of promoting your career, making your day at workmore fun, improving the work life of your colleagues, and generallymaking my life a whole lot better, I’d like to give you some feedbackon giving feedback. As usual, the ideas are simple–it’s doing themthat’s tricky.
The first rule of great feedback is this: No one cares about your opinion.
I don’t want to know how you feel, nor do I care if you would buyit, recommend it, or use it. You are not my market. You are not myfocus group.
What I want instead of your opinion is your analysis. It does me nogood to hear you say, ""I’d never pick that box up."" You can add a greatdeal of value, though, if you say, ""The last three products thatsucceeded were priced under $30. Is there a reason you want to pricethis at $31?"" Or, ""We analyzed this market last year, and we don’tbelieve there’s enough room for us to compete. Take a look at thisspreadsheet."" Or even, ""That font seems hard to read. Is there a way todo a quick test to see if a different font works better for ouraudience?""
Analysis is a lot harder than opinion because everyone is entitledto his or her own taste (regardless of how skewed it might be). Afaulty analysis, however, is easy to dismantle. But even though it’sscary to contribute your analysis to a colleague’s proposal, it’s stillabsolutely necessary.
The second rule? Say the right thing at the right time.
If you’re asked to comment on a first-draft proposal that willeventually wind its way to the chairman’s office, this is not the timeto point out that ""alot"" is two words, not one. Copyediting thedocument is best done just once, at the end, by a professional. Whileit may feel as if you’re contributing something by making commentsabout currently trivial details, you’re not. Instead, try to figure outwhat sort of feedback will have the most positive effect on the finaloutcome, and contribute it now.
Far worse, of course, than the prematurely picky comment is theway-too-late deal-breaker remark. If I’ve built a detailed plan for anew factory in Hoboken, New Jersey (and negotiated all the variancesand integrated the existing landscaping), the time to tell me you werethinking of relocating the plant to Secaucus was six months ago, notthe night before the groundbreaking.
The third rule? If you have something nice to say, please say it.
I’ve been working with someone for about a year, and in that entiretime, he’s never once prefaced his feedback with, ""This was a reallyterrific piece of work,"" or ""Wow! This is one of the best ideas I’veheard in a while."" Pointing out the parts you liked best is much morethan sugarcoating. Doing so serves several purposes. First, it puts youon the same side of the table as me, making it more likely that yourconstructive criticism will actually be implemented. If you can startby seeing the project through my eyes, you’re more likely to analyze(there’s that word again) the situation in a way that helps me reach mygoals. ""I think it’s great that you want to get our quality ratings up.Let’s see whether the added people you say this initiative requires arereally necessary, and whether beginning your report with staffing needsis the best way to get this past senior management.""
Second, it makes it so much more likely that I will come to you forfeedback in the future. It’s easy to interpret the absence of positivefeedback as the absence of any sort of approval or enthusiasm. Finally,being nice to people is fun.
If I haven’t intimidated you with my other rules, here’s the last one: Give me feedback, no matter what.
It doesn’t matter if I ignored your feedback last time (maybe that’sbecause you gave me your opinion, not an analysis). It doesn’t matterif you’re afraid your analysis might ultimately be a little shaky. Itdoesn’t matter if you’re the least powerful person in the room. Whatmatters is that you’re smart; you understand something about theorganization, the industry, and the market; and your analysis (at thevery least) could be the kernel of an idea that starts me down atotally different path.","July 22, 2006","Feedback, Analysis, Constructive criticism"
No stoplights,"Even the libertarians among us aren’t opposed to stop lights.

Stop lights are essential in almost all marketplaces.
While individuals might moan about how they were treated, we all realize that without some sort of central allocation of scarce resources (like a piece of tarmac or a booth at a trade show), chaos ensues. And the chaos hurts everyone.
Too often, the central authority tries to exert too much of a tax, tries to profit from a market rather than make one.

What I found interesting is that more than half of all bloggers are doing it for themselves. (Always a good reason to do something). In other words, it’s not for commercial gain or to find a large audience of strangers. Instead, it’s a form of self-expression, a chance to be creative or share some ideas.

Careful Consideration and Analysis,"Most organizations view business development opportunities as a threat.
A threat because a mistake could upset the status quo, could cost money or time, or even get someone in trouble.
After an initial screening, the typical bizdev proposal is given Careful Consideration and Analysis. Which means that lawyers work hard to make sure (among a hundred other things) that the trademark licensing deal is accurate and appropriate (SM instead of TM, please) and that they’ve done their job and that nothing bad can happen.
The problem, as you’ve already guessed, is that fashion is unpredictable. So, if the very point of the bizdev deal is to engage in a search for a hit, to do something new and inexpensive that may or may not work, then Careful Consideration and Analysis is probably completely inappropriate. Careful Consideration and Analysis leads to high overhead, slow turnaround and plenty of ""no"".
The alternative might be, What’s the Worst That Could Happen? Look at a deal. Decide if there’s enough upside possibility. Do the What’s the Worst That Could Happen test. Figure out how to avoid the most egregious outcomes. Then do it.
Repeat.
My guess is that Starbucks’ digital music efforts didn’t pass the Careful Consideration and Analysis test. But they did it anyway. And it failed. No big deal. Why? Because What’s the Worst That Could Happen was pretty low.","July 19, 2006","Business Development, Risk Assessment, Innovation"

If the receptionist greets just 100 people a day, that’s 20,000 people a year. Is it worth a dollar per interaction to transform all of those interactions into something spectacular?

"Newspaper fraud, tv ratings","Two interesting ideas at the same time this week.
First, after a bazillion years, Nielsen announces that they will start to rate the viewership of commercials. The obvious question, ""why wait so long?"" The answer is that the networks are a critical client of Nielsen, and the last thing in the universe they want is to rate commercials. The surprising thing is that many advertisers don’t want the ratings either. Why? Because as soon as you measure, you need to admit you failed. So you need to tell your boss you wasted a few million dollars…
Second, Doug Karr writes in to take newspapers and the Audit Bureau of Circulation to task for the changing standards in newspaper ratings. The numbers are a lot less strict… and a lot softer… than they were a decade or two ago, he reports.
Measurement is always tricky, because people believe what they want to believe and find the numbers to back it up. In both cases, we’re seeing how advertisers and media companies are complicit at weaving a story that doesn’t really hold up. How many ""hits"" did your web page get last week?

Fear of a small enemy,"Most big organizations operate out of fear as much as they do out of a desire for growth. And a new fear is spreading through the marketing department: fear of the little guy.
Forever and ever, the masses were king. People were disconnected, so annoying three or six or even 10% of your audience wasn’t such a big deal.
Now, though, that lone disgruntled customer can make an awful lot of noise on her blog.
While some organizations are trying to flip the funnel and give a megaphone to their happiest customers (leveraging their positive word of mouth) more are obsessed with silencing the dissenters.
Just as asymmetrical warfare has turned our geopolitical system upside down, the same thing is happening in the marketing world. While it’s tempting to spend all your time stamping out the little enemies, the architecture of the system favors a strategy of embracing and leveraging your happy constituents instead.

What should Digg do?,"I’ve been thinking a lot aboutDigg and the othersocial news services.Start here:they have far more readers than writers.
I don’t have access to the data, but I’m betting ten or twenty times as many people read the Digg list as post to it.
Which is just fine.
Second:there’s no way they will ever make a profit from their readers. That’s becausea. more and more will find the hotlists in places other than their siteandb. people reading the hotlist are unlikely to be swayed by an ad.
Think about reading the Billboard charts or the Amazon bestseller list. That’s a very goal-directed activity, and the goal isn’t necessarily to find something that’s NOT a bestseller. People skip the ads on the bestseller page, but read the ads in the classified section.
But that’s just fine too.
The reason?
Third:the Diggers, the posters, the surfers… these are very highly-leveraged people. Call them the Legion of Super Surfers. Okay, bad acronym, maybe not. Call them the league of the leading edge.
The leading edge has always been important. Now, though, since they have a megaphone, since Digg and the others are amplifying their movements, they are far, far more important than ever before.
And that’s Digg’s asset.They have aggregated the league.
So what now?
Get permission.
Get permission to fead the League tidbits about the future. The reason they are Diggers is that they like being first, they like discovering cool stuff and then sharing it. So organize that process and monetize it.
Here’s what I would do (two alternatives)
1. Say to every Digger: here’s our FirstLook RSS feed (or sign up by email). Every two days, we send you a link to an article, a new product, a political idea–whatever topic you tell us you love.
Then, go to the teeming masses of marketers out there and invite them to nominate their new ideas, their new posts, their new sites to your editor. The editor picks the ones that are good enough, that make the cut. Figure three or ten or a hundred a day, depending on the demand. Once demand goes up, charge $20 just to submit one, so the editor can hire a squadron of assistants.
Alert the marketers that have something worth of distribution. Let the others down easy. Now, let the ones that qualify bid against each other. High bidder gets first billing, top five bidders make the list.
Alert the 500 or the 5,000 or the 50,000 Diggers that signed up. They see a list of things that might be tomorrow’s big news. Theydiggthe ones they love. Marketers save millions and months. Digg makes a fair profit and becomes a key powerbroker in the launch of the new. Diggers who choose to get to see a commercial glimpse of tomorrow (the same way reporters choose to look at press releases from the right media outlets).
2. The other alternative could happen tomorrow. Build a Squidoo lens or a blog for Legion members. Figure out how to assemble a thousand or even 200 like-minded diggers. Have them sign up and give you their email address. Use the RSS feed of the lens to keep your members up to date. Now, instead of finding readers for your ""ads"", you find ads for your readers. Every day or two, your post goes out to your members. Every day or two, you make a hundred or a thousand or ten thousand dollars from someone who had a story worthy of being distributed.
Obviously, neither approach works if you sell out. Neither approach works the minute you stop representing the interests of the League. Take a lot from Zenith or Quasar to push some lame device and you fail.

The trend to “best available”,"Most customers choose between ""good enough"" and ""best available""
My guess is that before the consumer culture took hold, good enough was the order of the day. Without a lot of lists, rankings, options and varieties, good enough would have to do.
Good enough was the core of a lot of markets… from accounting firms to flour and sugar.
Between human nature and spoiled baby boomers, best available appears to be taking over.
Zales jewelry stores misunderstood this. They saw the growth of Tiffany’s as an indication that consumers wanted to spend a lot for jewelry, so they relentlessly upgraded pricing and selection. They failed in their attempt to grow market share and profits, fired the CEO and retrenched. Why? Because expensive Zales jewelry is neither good enough nor the best available. It was in a horrible middle ground.
Customers who seek out good enough can be satisfied, which is good, but rarely upgrade, which, for the marketer, is not so good. Marketers who try to be best available have an ongoing competition problem, though, because best available is a hard position to sustain.
Which now, in our era of the $12,000 cell phone, leads us to a new position: ""best available (within reason)."" What never ceases to amaze me is how extravagant consumers are willing to be when they define ""within reason."" Maybe a $300 nylon messenger bag is within reason. Maybe a $400 million CEO paycheck is within reason. We keep redefining reasonable all the way to the bank.","July 9, 2006","best available, consumer behavior, market positioning"

In our permission marketing world, sometimes it’s easy to forget how important selling is. Not because people are so stupid that they need to be sold something. Not because selling is obsolete because you can just search for what you want and then buy it. No, because selling overcomes fear. Fear of closing, fear of commitment, fear of blanching or sauteeing or just plain fear of buying something.

"104 years later, the most important invention","Well, maybe the car is the most important (in terms of impact), but air conditioning comes close, and for much more subtle reasons.
You may have noticed that July is a little slow where you are. Same here. Web traffic goes down, productivity goes down, people work less, move slower, the whole bit. In Europe, I’ve heard, entire countries shut down in August.
How come?
The heat.
There’s a reason that New York City isn’t in Belize.
For centuries, modern man in the Northern Hemisphere has adapted to a ""don’t work so hard it’s hot"" mindset. In places where it’s hot all the time, this is a huge hit on the economy, as you can imagine.
So what’s the big deal with air conditioning?
Well, in addition to leveling off the year (you can work just as comfortably in July in New York as you can in November now), air conditioning levels off theworld.Air conditioning permits knowledge workers to thrive in India or Cancun. Air conditioning creates year-round demand for all sorts of items that would have been seasonal otherwise (from nice restaurants to shoes…)
And air conditioning has plenty of unintended (side) effects. As the less-industrialized world realizes that air conditioning pays for itself with huge increases in productivity, they buy more (air conditioning has only been popular worldwide for forty years… it’s still catching on). As people buy more, they use more energy, create more greenhouse gases, make the world hotter. Price of energy goes up… etc.
And as a marketer, air conditioning changes your world. You grew up not needing to worry about Ecuador, because it wasn’t a competitor and it wasn’t a market. Now it’s both.

Raising the bar,"Tim Manners does a great summary of Gamal Aziz’s work at MGM:reveries magazine: Working Backward.

In a nutshell, regardless of how well a product or service is performing, Aziz starts with the potential that product has (when it hits 11 on the dial, or is completely sold out), then he subtracts what it’s doing and records the rest as a loss.
A loss!
That means that every book that doesn’t sell at least as well as theDaVinci Codeis at some level, a failure.

Who sets your agenda?,"In the States, today is one of those weird pre-holiday days.
Many people aren’t working. Some are half working. For most people, their work agenda for today was set by the calendar or their boss.
Weekends are stressful for a lot of people who love their work, because the agenda gets reset, reset by family, not by an internal to-do list or a boss.
And at work, where does your list come from? Do you answer emails by date received, by urgency, by sender? Who decides that? Which blogs do you read, which tasks do you do?
It’s fascinating to watch someone who has made a shift from a big company to solo work, or the other way around. The biggest challenge, by far, is one of agenda.What do I do now? What do I do next?

Should NBC invest money in free online YouTube content or another show for the 9 pm Thursday slot? That’s an agenda question first and foremost. Should you go on another sales call or improve the materials you’ve got so the next call will go better? Back to agenda.

What should Starbucks do?,"Markwrites in to share this picture.
At first, I felt badly for them, because there’s along historyof fake Starbucks coupons. Then I read the real scoop from theAP.
Here’s the thing: if you deal with consumers, you’re going to find that some of them are very eager to take advantage of you. And if taking advantage of you means aggressively distributing a coupon, they’re going to do it.
Rule #1: don’t expect that anything on the Internet won’t get out of hand. If you don’t want it to get out of hand, it probably will.
Rule #2: if something gets out of hand, and you made a promise, better figure out a way to keep it. This sign is an ineffective response.  If it were my call, I’d take advantage of the ""one coupon per customer"" presumption and put a little tick on the buyer’s driver’s license or similar… just enough to slow down the particularly egregious scammers (who in this case aren’t really scammers. Starbucks asked for it).
Rule #3: have a policy (I know, I hate policies) about internet coupons before someone invents a fake one. You ought to respect the person who traveled to do business with you without doing something that’s going to bankrupt you. ""Davis Burritos never ever accepts coupons distributed online. If you’ve got one, it’s a fake. But, since you came all this way, feel free to exchange your fake coupon for a free drink with any biggie meal.""

PS When I was in business school, we did the McDonald’s case. Part of our preparation was to go to the nearby McDonald’s with a stopwatch and clipboard. We walked in the door and stood just long enough to get noticed. Boy did those guys hop to attention. Then we went to another McDonald’s and performed the following experiment (please, please do not try this at home, just take my word for it). We ordered a milkshake and a Big Mac. Ate half the Big Mac. Drank half the milkshake. We put the Big Mac remainder into the milkshake cup and went to the counter, ""I’m sorry, I can’t drink this shake, there’s a Big Mac in it."" They gave us a new one.
Why?

Marketing Morality,"Is that an oxymoron? Is it possible to hold a marketer morally responsible?
Let’s start at the beginning:
Marketing works.
Marketing (the use of time and money to create a story and spread it) works. Human beings don’t make rational decisions, they make emotional ones, and we’ve seen time and again that those decisions are influenced by the time and money spent by marketers.
So, assuming you’ve got no argument with that (and if you’re a marketer who doesn’t believe marketing works, we need to have a longer discussion…) then we get to the next part of the argument:
Your marketing changes the way people act.
Not completely. Of course not. You can’t get babies to start smoking cigars and you can’t turn Oklahoma into a blue state. But on the margins, especially if your product or service has some sort of archetypal connection to your customers, you can change what people do.
Now it gets tricky. It gets tricky because you can no longer use the argument, ""We’re just giving intelligent adults the ability to make a free choice."" No, actually you’re not. You’re marketing something so that your product will have an edge over the alternative.
Everyone knows about milk. The milk people don’t need to spend $60 million a year advertising milk in order to be sure we all get a free choice about whether to buy milk or not. No, they do it because it makes milk sales go up.
What a huge responsibility.
If you’re a good marketer (or even worse, a great marketer), it means that you’re responsible for what you sell. When you choose to sell it, more of it gets sold.
I have no standing to sit here and tell you that it’s wrong for you to market cigarettes or SUVs, vodka or other habit-forming drugs. What we do need to realize, though, is that it’s our choice and our responsibility. As marketers, we have the power to change things, and the way we use that power is our responsibility–not the market’s, not our boss’s. Ours.
The morality of marketing is this: you need to be able to stand up and acknowledge that you’re doing what you’re doing. ""By marketing this product in this beautiful packaging, I’m causing a landfill to get filled a lot faster, but that’s okay with me."" Marketers can’t say, ""Hey, the market spoke. It’s not my decision.""
The phone rang yesterday. The recording said, ""We’re sorry to disturb you. This call was meant for an answering machine."" Then it hung up. Actually, the marketer wasn’t sorry. The marketer was using his market power to violate the do not call registry and to interrupt my day (on my machine or otherwise) so he could selfishly try to sell me something. While it may or may not be legal to do this, it’s irrelevant. What’s relevant is that the marketer decided that the ends justified the means, and he needs to acknowledge that on his way to work today.
The same way the marketer at Malboro needs to acknowledge that by being a good marketer, she’s putting her kids through college at the same time she’s killing thousands of people. It’s a choice–her choice.
We’re responsible for what we sell and how we sell it. We’re responsible for the effects (and the side effects) of our actions.
It is our decision. Whatever the decision is, you need to own it. If you can’t look that decision in the mirror, market something else.",,"Marketing ethics, responsibility, consumer influence"
Why care about Pluto?,"Is it just because this is a slow news cycle?
Pluto is custom-made ideavirus material. Why?
It’s interesting to note that you couldn’t (and shouldn’t) try to make any money from this. Once again, there’s a difference between getting people’s attention (the cover of Newsweek, for example) and getting their money.
People for Pluto
My humble contribution: instead of demoting Pluto, they ought to promote a whole bunch of smaller planettes. And they shouldsell the naming rightsto various marketers (Goofy being the first easy sale) and use the millions they would earn to fund actual science education on a planet desperately in need of it. If it’s okay to sponsor the US Open, why isn’t it okay to sponsor UB313? I’m also selling the naming rights to my car.
UPDATE: Jay Porter bought the naming rights to my Prius in exchange for a donation to his favorite charity. Thanks, Jay. The Jay Porter Prius is now averaging 48 mpg, fyi. No word yet on what’s going on with UB313.","August 29, 2006","Pluto, naming rights, science education"
When bureaucracies become single minded,"One of the most powerful things you can do is focus your entire organization on a single goal, a single idea, a single way of doing things.
We’ve seen this used successfully in organizations like Federal Express (which spent its first decade obsessed with being on time) and Southwest Airlines (which wants to be nice).
Be careful what you wish for. Two true stories from last week:
Standing in the airport security line. The guy behind me hadn’t got the memo, apparently. He’s busy dumping toothpaste and shaving cream in the garbage. Then he grabs an aftershave product and says, quite loudly, ""I think I can bring this… it’s a balm."" I’m not making that up.
The woman didn’t bat an eye. She said, ""fine.""
Then, traveling through Newark, I grabbed a bottle of water after getting off the plane. The counter person (not a trained security agent, mind you), says, ""you need to leave the cap here."" This got my attention. It turns out that the policy at Newark (not other places I visited recently, just Newark) is that you can’t buy a bottled water post-security and keep the cap.
It’s a bring your own cap sort of situation I guess. (Are you allowed to bring your own cap?)
I will leave the analysis of the logic to you.
By energizing and focusing a huge organization of people on the eradication of liquids of all kinds (but not balms), the government tells a story. It’s a story to the passengers, and a story to their employees as well. Yes, it’s all marketing, this too.",,"bureaucracy, focus, airport security"
Palinode,"Peter points us to today’sA.Word.A.Day
""palinode (PAL-uh-noad) noun
A poem in which the author retracts something said in an earlier poem.
[The illustrator and humorist Gelett Burgess (1866-1951) once wrote apoem called The Purple Cow:
I never saw a purple cow,I never hope to see one;But I can tell you, anyhow,I’d rather see than be one.
The poem became so popular and he became so closely linked with this singlequatrain he later wrote a palinode:
Confession: and a Portrait, Too,Upon a Background that I Rue!
Oh, yes, I wrote ‘The Purple Cow,’I’m sorry now I wrote it!But I can tell you anyhow,I’ll kill you if you quote it.
[It was the same Burgess who coined the wordblurb.]
I think there’s a lot to be said for retractions. Retractions let your marketing (and your entire organization) move forward even after you’ve made a mistake. We’re too slow to admit that we were wrong sometimes.
PS, feel free to quote myPurple Cowif you like. No harm done.",,"palinode, retraction, poetry"
Patagonia’s choice,"The best stereo speakers don’t sell very well at retail. That’s because making a speaker that sounds good in the store (and is easy to sell) isn’t the same thing as making one that’s great to live with for years.
Same thing is true with restaurant food, chinos, vegetables (orange oranges are easier to sell than greenish ones), cars and even workman’s comp policies. There’s a difference between shelf appeal and the long run.
Patagoniahas changed the line up of clothes they make (fewer models, changed less often) and the materials they use (organic cotton, costs more) so that they are sacrificing shelf appeal for a story and for long-term performance. It doesn’t always work, but it’s always a choice you face.

What’s expected,"It’s expected that you’ll tip the masseuse (masseur) at the spa. But not the acupuncturist down the street.
It’s expected that the CEO of a public company will hire a hotshot consultant to help her do her job. The CFO gets to do that too. But not the receptionist.
It’s expected that coffee in a fancy restaurant will cost  more than it does at a cafe.
It’s expected that wifi in a business hotel ought to be free. But it didn’t used to be that way.
It’s expected that the TV in the gym will be on, always. It’s expected, though, that you’ll wear headphones to listen to Marley.
It’s expected that you take a family vacation to Florida. It’s not expected, though, to take the kids to Topeka.
It’s expected that a child-care facility will run ads with lots of rainbows. A Freudian psychiatrist, on the other hand, is expected not to advertise at all.
Faced with expectations, you’ve got three really big options:
1.Embraceexpectations and build a product or service that fits what people are looking for. No change of behavior necessary. Be in the right place at the right time with the right thing priced appropriately and hope the competition doesn’t show up.
2.Changethe expectations. No one expected to be able to buy digital music for 99 cents a song and have it show up on their iPod. Now, that’s the default expectation in some communities. Changing an expectation builds a huge barrier to those that might follow. Change is time consuming, expensive and rarely happens on schedule.
3.Defythe expectations. Do the unexpected. This is tempting but often leads to nothing but noise.

The thing about the wind,"I just had some great windsurfinglessons(no, that’s not me–the only thing I had in common with this guy is that we were both upside down). I can tell you that windsurfing is very easy… except for the wind.
The wind makes it tricky, of course. It’s not particularly difficult to find and rent great equipment, and the techniques are fairly straightforward. What messes the whole plan up is the fact that the wind is unpredictable. It’ll change exactly when you don’t want it to.
Just the other day I read a riff that reminded me that the same thing is true about customer service (it would be a lot easier if it weren’t for the customers). Then I realized that every single function of an organization has a wind problem.
Accounting would be easy if every incoming report was accurate and on time. Sales would be easy if it weren’t for the prospects not buying from you all the time. Marketing would be easy if every prospect and customer thought the way you do…
Here’s the good news: the fact that it’s difficult and unpredictable is the best thing that’s happened to you all day. Because if it were any other way, there’d be no profit in it. The reason people bother to go windsurfing is that the challenge makes it interesting. The driving force that gets people to pay a specialist is because their disease is unpredictable or hard to diagnose.The reason we’re here is to solve the hard problems.

What happens to radio?,"I did aninterviewwith Mark Ramsey about the future of radio. Here’s a little squib about the four ways I think the medium might go:
Scenario A:Everyone has Wi-Fi or WiMAX in their car. Once that happens, we’re not talking about 200 XM radio stations, we’re talking about 2 million, and all bets are off.
Scenario B:The aftermarket people get very focused on putting hard drives and iPod docks in cars. If that happens, again, radio is in trouble, because people are gonna bring their own pre- recorded content with them.
Scenario C:We end up in the satellite world, they figure out how to get a little bit more content through those pipes and we end up with 300 or 400 channels in the car. I had XM radio for a year to check it out. What’s interesting is it doesn’t matter how many stations there are, sooner or later you end up with four. And so the thing is, what do you have to do to be one of the four, and how do you live in a world where you’ve got hundreds of competitors a click away, but if you spend all your time not offending anybody, you’ll never get anybody.

Scenario D: A hybrid of what we’ve got now: Traditional analog radio combined with HD combined with satellite. This scenario will, I think, not make anybody particularly happy, because the advertisers are going to be faced with an increasingly splintered audience that’s hard to address, and as a result, it will be hard for that local car dealership or that politician to do a sensible radio buy.

Thinking about snakes on a plane,"The Mainstream Media was enthralled by the Snakes on a Plane story. Here, at last, was proof positive that the internet changes everything… hey, it even changes movies!
Hollywood was scared, of course, but they usually are. They understand, finally, how to use TV, and now, all of a sudden, something new to worry about.
So the glee from all sides when SOAP took a hit (only $15 mm for a b movie in late August at the box office) was palpable. People were puzzled. One pundit said it teaches Hollywood just that the Net is a good place to run ads.
I fear that people are missing a fundamental truth: just because people know who you are doesn’t mean they’re going to buy what you sell.
There’s a difference between infamy (or celebrity) and the consumer’s desire to buy.
I knew all about SOAP and had no desire whatsoever to go. I’m just not ready to sit in a theatre with a bunch of people afraid of airplanes.

Welcome to Shuffleworld,"College dorm 1979, every kid had three dozen albums. You picked the oneyou wanted to listen to while you did your calculus homework (you knewthem all by heart), took it out of the sleeve and played it. (small aside: every single woman I knew had: James Taylor, Billy Joel, Fleetwood Mac, Carly Simon and perhaps one other. Not sure why this is relevant, but there you go.)
Driving the car yesterday, I realized that I haven’t listened to any of my Elvis Costello records in a while. The reason, it turns out, is that they hadn’t been picked out for me by the magic of shuffle. I’ve got enough music on my hard disk that some of it has become invisible.
The same thing is true, times a million, with websites. Every blog, every site is invisible… until it comes up on shuffle. The shuffle ofredditordiggor a cross-reference in someone else’s rss feed.
Thepagethat Ron and I did was #1 on Digg and Delicious yesterday, at least for a little bit. And the traffic was huge. It really is like winning the attention lottery.
And that’s what has happened to all of us. The local newspaper never had to worry about an attention lottery–everyone in town read the paper. Today, because it’s become molecuralized, our attention flits around, shuffled by one automated (or handbuilt) editor or another.
Which brings us back to subscription. The only win I see in the long run is for the winner of today’s attention lottery to earn a subscription (an RSS feed or an email sign up or a podcast subscription) that gives them a chance to be noticed tomorrow as well.

"…in the middle, Starting","When a director makes a movie, she can be pretty confident that the audience will see it from the beginning straight through to the end.
When I write a book, I have the same luxury. That’s usually the case when I give a speech as well. It’s awfully frustrating to be giving a talk to a dozen people and then have the head guy walk in ten minutes late… now what do I do? Do I start over and bore the people kind enough to be on time (though possibly succeed in my argument to the head guy) or do I press on? If the beginning wasn’t important, I wouldn’t have wasted all that time on it!
Major advertisers have the expectation that they don’t need to keep reintroducing themselves. People know who Coke and Nike are. The new ads can pick up in the middle without explaining exactly what “Mountain Dew” is.
Unlike books and movies and speeches and sales pitches, it’s pretty obvious that blogs and websites don’t work that way. The traffic for almost all blogs is growing, in some cases quite quickly. Some websites double in traffic every month or two. My blogometer tells me that about half of the people who read my blog each week have never been here before.
Hence the dilemma.
Blog writing is different than almost any other sort of exposition. Some people have been with you for years. They understand your conventions, your shorthands and your biases. They know you’ve written a few books, appeared as a child actor in Star Trek or have a deep and abiding hatred for cats. You can drop a few hints and they get it.
The rest of your readers are left clueless.
Which leads to the squeaky wheel problem. Among your newbies are several people who won’t hesitate to send you an email, post a comment or leave in a huff. They don’t get it and they want you to know they don’t get it.
Your inclination, if you’re at all like me, is to have that person’s voice in the back of your head every time you post an entry or design a page. “But what about Fred, who just got here?” If you’re working in an organization, the voice will be even louder. Your peers will remind you of the Freds of the world every time they hear from them.
Resist!
Starbucks doesn’t start over every time someone walks in, and neither does your church. Great websites don’t explain every little icon in big type–they give newbies a chance to figure it out and they let the regulars use a tool they enjoy.
Some of the most popular blogs and websites on the web are hard to understand the first time you get there. Not hard for hard’s sake, but hard because there’s a lot of power in a little space and explaining it all would actually make it work worse.
If I was always trying to catch people up, I’d end every post by pointing to my lens. But I won’t, because then you’d stop reading, wouldn’t you?

I found John’s seven rules in a searchcache.Here’s a summary of what doesn’t work:
1. Asking a question with no query
Examples: ""Your neighbors don’t like you."" ""Some people think you killed your wife.""
2. Double-barrelled questions
Like: ""Is this your first business? How did you get started?"" You’re unlikely to get answers to both. One question at a time.
3. Overloading
Ask: short, simple questions. ""What is it like to be accused of murder?""
4. Adding your own remarks
Again, this is not the time or place to say that you hate Chryslers… You’re not being interviewed.
5. Trigger words
One famous example of this was when TV reporter John Stossell asked a pro wrestler about the ""sport” by volunteering this about the fighting: ""I think it’s fake."" The pro wrestler hit him–twice. ""Was that fake?"" he demanded…
6. Hyperbole by the questioner
Overstatement typically causes the interview subject to counterbalance by understating…
7. Closed query (Yes or No question)
If the question begins with a verb, its most likely a closed question — and will generate a one word answer.

B&Nis doing a big promotion, and I want to repay the favor by sending afew dozen heavy hitters to the store to buy copies for their teams. Ifyou don’t liveneara store, call one and they’ll ship em.
I wrote this book as a way for my blog readers to share some of myideas with their non-blog-reading colleagues. This promotion is sort ofa way to jumpstart that.
Justemailme if you’reinterested in buying the books and coming and I’ll send you my faxnumber. First 31 people to fax over a receipt get a seat. If I get moreresponse, I’ll do a second session a week later.
[UPDATE: some readers have explained that the whole BN retail process is too logistically difficult. My goal in this promotion was to do something fun, not painful. So, if you find yourself stuck, feel free to us thislinkinstead. Thanks to everyone for all that driving around…]",,"Q&A session, book promotion, call-in"
The triumph of the banal,"It’s true: the vast majority of successful products are hardly remarkable.
As I walked to the Union Square market today, carrying two thermAsnap™ cooler bags, I thought about the bags. This company appears to be doing exceptionally well. They have a huge profit margin, very strong distribution in fish and ice cream stores and supermarkets, and they keep growing (hey, theirwebsiteeven has videos).
But the product is poorly designed. The thermAsnaps come UNsnapped all the time. The graphics are abysmal. The copy includes the helpful reminder that you shouldn’t put hot and cold items together in the same bag.
It doesn’t matter. Not one bit. They’re still doing great.
The lesson? I think that there are two. The first is that setting out to win in an overlooked market by sewing up distribution and eliminating reasons for your distributors to switch is a fine plan when it works. And the second is that there are plenty of markets where competition is thin and becoming a slave to fashion not only isn’t necessary, it’s not even a good idea. You don’t always have to show up on the ""what’s hot"" list to be successful.
Remember, too, not to put your hot and cold items in the same bag at the same time, please.",,"successful products, distribution strategy, overlooked markets"
Lotions and Potions,"What’s worth more, a daily skin tightening cream that makes a patient feel firm and supple and thin, or a tummy tuck that actually makes a patient thin?
What’s more more, a KPMG study, performed by 30 analysts, that demonstrates a plant must be closed, or an organizational pscyhologist spending time with the management team so that they gain enough confidence and communication skills that they actually grow the business?
What’s worth more, a divorce lawyer (who creates something permanent) or a mediator, who sometimes saves a relationship?
Are placebos worth more than surgery? Is an inspirational management book worth more than a Wall Street banker?
I was talking with a plastic surgeon over dinner, and the chasm couldn’t have been more clear. Western medicine is arranged around the permanent, the measurable, the knife. Yet people, many of them anyway, would rather spend money on the potion or the lotion that somehow promises a more magical solution.

Why are we discussing this now?,"So, I started my morning with a dozen ears of local corn from the farmer’s market, waiting to be cooked.
I did agoogle searchand was delighted (okay, stunned) to find thislensas the fourth site listed. A quick look led me tothis post, all about sustainable vegan cooking in Las Vegas. The post was perhaps the fifth piece of media I’d seen in the last week that referenced just how far food travels to get to us. The average food item goes about 1,500 miles from where it’s grown to where it’s consumed.
This has probably been true for decades or more, but now it’s on the radar. Now people are writing about it, blogging about it, challenging grocery stores about it. It’s on our list, at least for now.
Why not a year ago or five years ago?
One mistake marketers make is a little like the goldfish that never notices the water in his tank. Our environment is changing. Always. Incrementally. Too slowly to notice, sometimes. But it changes.

Airport parking and Ross Perot,"There is no friction at a free PR press release site (PR Leap). It doesn’t matter who you know or how many phone calls you can afford to make… all press releases here are listed for free… though the paid ones move up.
The friction issue reminded me of an article about getting a parking spot at certain Metro North train stations. In order to be ""fair"", the railroad requires people to wait in line once a year (first come first served) to get a permit. The thing is, getting to a decent spot in line requires camping out all night. While this is fair in the sense that money is not an issue, the idea that everyone values their time the same seems sort of backwards.","August 12, 2006","Airport parking, press release, fairness"
Another brick in the wall,"Most of the changes you make in your product are designed to grow your market share… to get you new customers (by having them switch from the competition) or to grow the market (by having people enter your market) or to keep people from leaving in a churning market.
So, how do you get them to make the switch?
I think it might be useful to think of two kinds of innovations.
Call the first kind, ""another brick in the wall."" I was listening to two guys online (sorry, can’t remember where) discussing PDF printing. The first was talking about various shareware and freeware ways to get Windows to create PDF files. The second pointed out that it was built in already to the Mac.
First guy said, ""Yeah, I’m going to give up all of my hardware and software and switch just so I don’t have to install a piece of freeware…""
That ability on the Mac is another brick. Build enough bricks and soon enough, it is enough to switch.
The second kind we can call, ""game changers."" These are the remarkable innovations that make not switching painful. The sort offree prize insidethat reminds the unswitched that not having switched yet is painful. It doesn’t have to be a totally recasting of all that a product stands for. Interesting for me to note thatTime Machinemight be Apple’s latest game changer. It promises to relieve so much pain and anxiety in a certain class of user that for an informed chooser (and that’s not as big a category as any marketer wishes it was) it might just mean a whole new decision.
The other lesson here is this: game changers are rare. If you are swinging for the fences all the time, looking for one, you might end up striking out a lot. Bricks, on the other hand, are the way most industries are won.","August 11, 2006","innovation, market share, game changers"

Changing the air travel story,"Over the last five years, security measures have gradually erodedthe way people feelabout commercial air travel. Today’s events (“imminent” mid-air bomb plot disrupted)and the government’s reaction to them will, in my opinion, mark the tipping point for an enormous amount of business travel by commercial air.
I’m delighted that the talented and brave investigators foiled this plot, and I’m saddened that we live in a world where something like this could even happen… the fact remains, though, that a key element of our lives has been changed, perhaps forever.
When you need an additional 90 minutes, can’t bring your laptop (or even a book on some routes) and can’t have a bottle of water, the calculus for most trips is fundamentally changed. Years ago, Tom Peters argued hard and long for the value of showing up, of being there in person, of establishing a face to face relationship with the person on the other side.

Our man in Havana,"The other day on the radio, I heard an interview with the Chicago Tribune’s Havana bureau chief.
Wow. Think of all the newspapers. Think of all the cities that are as important as Havana. That’s a lot of people.
Is it even remotely conceivable that ten years from now, the Chicago Tribune is going to have a bureau chief in London or Beijing, never mind Havana?
I just read the reports on Joe and his primary from a paper inAustralia…
Now that media has been completely atomized, blown to bits and rearranged, how do they pay for their man in Havana? They don’t, I bet.
Just as we’ve seen video take a huge downturn in quality (think American Idol vs. M*A*S*H) as the quantity has soared, it’s inevitable that news is going to go down the same path. The good news is that, just as video is rebounding as the voices find their footing, news will too. It won’t be ""our"" man in Havana. It’ll be a number of individuals representing themselves and building a following–with a filter to be named later.
The most useful thing you can do with this piece of data is exactly what William Randolph Hearst and others did several generations ago–realize that there are a passel of slots available. Go fill one (or more) and grow it. No, it’s not worth a lot now, but we’re already seeing that once a blog fills a niche well, it becomes a cash cow (and a center of influence)… far faster than a newspaper ever did.",,"Havana, media evolution, blogging"

Lesson learned at the movie theatre,"Years ago, when my wife and I used to go to the movies in Yonkers, we noticed that most of the teenage girls dressed alike. Big blond hair, high heels, you get the idea.
What I couldn’t understand was–who was their hero? Who did they look to to decide what was right and what wasn’t right? It’s easy to see kids that are trying to emulate a particular rapper, say, or career women trying to be Audrey Hepburn. But who was their role model?
After a few years, I figured it out… Barbie. As in the doll.
All a long way of pointing out that while great websites are fairly different (compare Google with Yahoo), most bad websites are sort of the same. And I have no idea what the role model is, but there are plenty ofplacesyou can go to get all the building blocks you need.

21 years later,"In 1985, I was already a Mac addict. I had beta tested the original Mac and had one of the very first desktop published newsletters (an internal rag at Spinnaker Software, where I worked). I once got into real trouble when the owner of a nearby restaurant called and yelled at me after I trashed his place in a review (I had a circulation of 45…)
One day, a buzz went through the office. We had a lot of cool visitors at Spinnaker (I think the Governor of Mass. came once) but this time it was a louder buzz. I heard from a fellow brand manager that Guy Kawasaki was in the office. Even then, probaby in his twenties, Guy had an aura around him. Not only that, but he had a check with him (we needed the cash).
When Guy’s blog came out a few months ago, it was an overnight success. Overnight? Hey, it took Guy, like it took me, twenty years of figuring it out.

Do you need a boss?,"You don’t realize how much you need a boss until you don’t have one. Bosses don’t always do the following, especially when they’re not very good bosses, but here’s what we know about good bosses:
Bosses organize your time for you.Bosses decide what’s urgent.Bosses give you cover when you work on something stupid (""she told me to!"")Bosses pay you even when the client doesn’t honor the invoice.Bosses can be sued.Bosses create deadlines, and stick with them.Bosses make sure you show up in the morning.Bosses pay for the Postits.Bosses give you someone to complain about.Bosses carve up the work and give you just that piece you signed up to do.Bosses give you a role model. (Sometimes one to work against, but that’s a different story).
The main thing a boss does, though, is give you the momentum you need to get through the stuff that takes perseverance. The main thing that ends the career of a Free Agent is the lack of a hand pushing on the back, someone handing out assignments and waiting for the deliverables.

Reflexology,"Ask Anna Wintour what makes a good article for Vogue, and she’ll answer you in a heartbeat. She won’t think about it or consider the question carefully… she just knows, by reflex.
A few years ago, Cubby Broccoli figured out the formula for how to make a James Bond movie. Once he confirmed he had something that worked, the formula became a reflex for him and his team.
Of course, it’s not just media reflexes. Ask a scientist a question and her reflex is to give you an answer that relies on her area of specialty. Sort of that, ""if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail…"" thing.
One web designer I know loves rollovers. Another abhors them. By reflex, when solving a design problem, they go with their strength. Every time.
There are macro-reflexes, like the temptation to spend money to build a new brand. And there are micro-reflexes, like the desire to scrawl notes on a legal pad whenever you’re at a seminar.
Consumers have reflexes, too. The reflex to just hang up on a telemarketer. The reflex to believe an ad if it looks official enough. The reflex to ignore whatever we hear on the radio.
Reflexology is critically important in living our lives and doing our jobs. Without a reflex answer, an innate instinct of what to do, you’d have to spend all your time starting over. We’d never get to read another Parker novel. And being a cop or a fireman would be essentially impossible.
You already know where I’m going with this, because as a reader of my blog you’ve developed a reflex that kicks in about this far in a post. The reflex, of course, has a downside.
The downside is that your reflex, the one that often gets you out of a jam, is exactly the same reflex that makes you stale. It’s exactly the same reflex that keeps you from seeing the obvious solution that you didn’t notice.
One reason newbies succeed so often in fast-changing markets is that they don’thavea reflex! They don’t get the benefits of the reflex, but they also are able to see what you can’t.

Where is the websheet?,"I need this, which means you might need it as well.
I need a web-based spreadsheet (likegoogle spreadsheet) or a plug in to Excel that makes it easy to do the following:
Calculate the contents of a field based on info from the web.
For example, let’s say you have a list of 20 brand names. This ‘websheet’ could automatically go to Google and return the URL of the first match of each search in a field right next to the name. Or return the number of Google matches. Or return the RSS feed of the nearest match of a blog on technorati.
Or it could go to Yahoo Finance and automatically look up the current stock price of a ticker symbol.
Or it could take a list of book titles and return the cover art from Amazon.
Once the infrastructure is there, building the particular routines would be a lot of fun for the hackers who are way smarter than me.
If the web is going to be as pervasive as we’ve all been describing it, it needs to get out of the browser and fast. I have no doubt that someone with talent and time could find the pieces necessary to do this, but I wonder why Google didn’t do it already or why someone hasn’t disrupted the spreadsheet market once and for all by offering it as a simple (and possibly free) product.

You don’t run a museum,"I don’t run one either.
Which makes this correspondence worth reading, I think.
I got a note from James Chung, who coordinated a session at something called the Museum Institute at the Sagamore. He asked me for my thoughts about museums and marketing, something to go along with a book or two that would be read by participants at the seminars.
I wrote,
Hi James,
My mom, before she passed away, was treasurer of the Museum Store Association, which was very important to her.
We’re members of the Museum of Natural History, used to go frequently to the Liberty Science Center, have been to the Hudson River Museum, the Cropsey Foundation, the Tenement Museum, the Cooper Union, The Guggenheim, The Whitney, etc. [I left out the big museums, which we go to every month or so]
I think in every single case, what keeps museums from being remarkable:
a. the curators think the item on display is the whole thing. As a result, they slack off and do less than they should in creating an overall story
b. they assume that visitors are focused, interested and smart. They are rarely any of the three. As a result, the visit tends to be a glossed over one, not a deep one or a transcendent one
c. science museums in particular almost beg people NOT to think.
I can’t remember the last time a museum visit made my cry, made me sad or made me angry (except at the fact that they don’t try hard enough).James was nice enough to write back with a summary from one of the people at the seminar:
The book discussion started off with my asking if they were surprised we had selected these books.  The consensus was no, not really, but about a third of the readers clearly hated the books.  Not for what they said so much, but they felt that he was not speaking about museums, his stuff did not apply to museums, or that it was all obvious anyway.
Well, that got the conversation going because then the people who liked the books acknowledged that overall, he was right.  And that yes, it is obvious stuff, but they (museum professionals) get so wrapped up in museum work that this is exactly the stuff they miss.  I asked if it was a case of missing the forest for the trees and they said yes.  They went around in circles a bit, and then I shared Seth’s comments on museums specifically.  Oh, they had a field day with that.
They asked how long it had been since he had been to a museum.  But the group that liked his books spoke up pretty quickly, and first acknowledged that he was trying to needle them, but then said – wait, he is part of our audience, and clearly he has thought this.  And if we are not listening to our audiences, then we may not be doing our jobs well at all.  This was bounced around for a while.  At the end I pulled it back towards Godin’s books and asked what, if anything, they got from the books, felt like they could take back to their museums and use, or share with their bosses.  Even a couple of the Godin-haters mentioned things they got from them.  After the book club, back at the cabin we were staying in, there was a lot of talking around the fireplace about branding and stories, so it was clear the books, and the discussion, made them think.
While I’m not thrilled that there are Godin-haters out there, I guess that goes with the territory. The takeaway for me is that in fact the issues of storytelling and remarkability and respect are universal, whether you’re a non-profit or a job-seeker. It’s all people, all the time.","September 28, 2006","museums, storytelling, marketing"

Your pasta problem,"Erik asks aboutPasta Express
The Pasta Express tube cooker is the fastest, easiest way to cook pasta, vegetables and more. You’ll enjoy delicious pasta cooked to perfection every time…no pots, no stove, no mess. The Pasta Express is great for all kinds of pasta, vegetables and even hot dogs.

Actually, the Pasta Express is a plastic tube with a perforated top. You put boiling water into it (probably a tricky act), add some pasta and watch it turn into a gloppy mass as the water cools. Not only doesn’t it solve your pasta problem (what, you didn’t have a pasta problem?) but it makes bad pasta.
So, how does it sell?

When culture gets stuck,"Classical music wasn’t always ‘classical’.
Geeks spend a lot of time worrying about the cutting edge, focusing on creating digg bait, reaching the early adopters, making something cool enough and fresh enough to capture attention and to spread.
We spend very little time thinking about the other end of the curve.
That’s where culture gets stuck.
Once something makes its way to the mass market, the mass market doesn’t want it to change. And once it moves from that big hump in the middle of the market to become a classic, the market doesn’t just want it to not change, they insist.
So classical music gets stuck because the new stuff isn’t like the regular kind, the classics. French food got stuck, because no restaurant could risk its 3 stars to try something new. A convention can’t change cities or formats. Schools can’t start their curriculum over… the culture gets stuck because the masses want it be stuck.
That’s because the late adopters and the laggards have plenty of money and influence–while the early adopters have a short attention span and rank low in persistence.
Inside most fields, we see pitched battles between a few people who want serious change to reinvigorate the genre they love–and the masses, who won’t tolerate change of any kind. Hey, there are still people arguing vehemently about whether Mass should be in Latin or not.
History has shown us that the answer is crystal clear: if you want change, you’ve got to leave. Change comes, almost always, from the outside. The people who reinvented music, food, technology and politics have always gone outside the existing dominant channels to create something new and vital and important.","September 23, 2006","culture, change, innovation"

Politics and the New Marketing,"Well, fall is here, so it’s time for a quick roundup of the good and the ineffective in political marketing:
Thisbookby Richard Viguerie lays out, far better than any traditional marketing book, the step by step approach that patient politicians can take to outlast and outpromote competing ideas. Emergencies rarely work in campaign strategy.
Thissitetakes a totally different tack. No direct response here, just a virus in the making.
Pastor John Hagee spreads hisideasby making deliberately provocative statements (‘Katrina was God’s way of punishing gay sinners in New Orleans’) that he knows will upset and outrage many people.
Thisgrouphas 51 members (after a few days) and is started by an ordinary non-politican person. For free. What happens when it has 51,000 members? 500,000? It’s unlikely that this particular cause and this particular site is the one, but have no doubt that it’s happening. There will be a woot or a digg or adaily candyfor every political point of view.
And finally, Senator Barack Obama blows part of his hard-earned credibility by spamming people looking for $50 donations for the DSCC (hint: if it starts with ""Dear SETH,"" it’s probably not personally written by the Senator.)
Your political goals (right, left or center) don’t really change the reality that marketing in politics is changing forever. The idea of a spend-and-burn candidacy is fading (how much more than a billion dollars per cycle can we spend?) and it’s being replaced by a person-by-person, viral approach that relies more than ever on authentic storytelling andworldviews.
Is it a good thing? It might be. It doesn’t really matter whether politicians like it or not, though, it’s happening. Behind the scenes, outside the Beltway, there are new assemblies of people coming together, people who are giving permission to hear focused messages, and people who are eager to spread the word, person to person.
Given the choice between a great TV director and an amazingly talented permission-marketing/viral specialist, I’d pick the specialist every time. The future of our world (if the future is determined by politicians… a scary thought) belongs to those that earn, build and protect a permission asset.",,"Political marketing, viral strategy, authentic storytelling"
It’s difficult to “hard work” your way to success,"Mac fans are crowing about Apple’s current success–that they have a market cap 20% higher than Dell’s. The lesson, other than the fact that pundits and the media are wrong 11times out of every 9 predictions, is that Apple didn’t succeed bydigging in, working all night and doing more of what they’d been doing.They succeeded because they willfully changed the game. And then changed it again.
Here’s a great list from David Pogue:Pogue’s Posts.
* Fortune, 2/19/1996: “By the time you read this story, the quirkycult company…will end its wild ride as an independent enterprise.”
* Time Magazine, 2/5/96: “One day Apple was a major technologycompany with assets to make any self respecting techno-conglomeratesalivate. The next day Apple was a chaotic mess without a strategicvision and certainly no future.”
* BusinessWeek, 10/16/95: “Having underforecast demand, the companyhas a $1 billion-plus order backlog….The only alternative: to mergewith a company with the marketing and financial clout to help Applesurvive the switch to a software-based company. The most likelycandidate, many think, is IBM Corp.”
* A Forrester Research analyst, 1/25/96 (quoted in, of all places,The New York Times): “Whether they stand alone or are acquired, Appleas we know it is cooked. It’s so classic. It’s so sad.”
* Nathan Myhrvold (Microsoft’s chief technology officer, 6/97: “TheNeXT purchase is too little too late. Apple is already dead.”
* Wired, “101 Ways to Save Apple,” 6/97: “1. Admit it. You’re out of the hardware game.”
* BusinessWeek, 2/5/96: “There was so much magic in Apple Computerin the early ’80s that it is hard to believe that it may fade away.Apple went from hip to has-been in just 19 years.”
* Fortune, 2/19/1996: “Apple’s erratic performance has given it thereputation on Wall Street of a stock a long-term investor wouldprobably avoid.”
* The Economist, 2/23/95: “Apple could hang on for years, gamelytrying to slow the decline, but few expect it to make such a mistake.Instead it seems to have two options. The first is to break itself up,selling the hardware side. The second is to sell the company outright.”
* The Financial Times, 7/11/97: “Apple no longer plays a leadingrole in the $200 billion personal computer industry. ‘The idea thatthey’re going to go back to the past to hit a big home run…isdelusional,’ says Dave Winer, a software developer.”","September 21, 2006","Apple, success, transformation"

Successful?,"Are you successful? Is your brand or your organization?
How do you know?
It’s a serious question. How do you know when you’re successful–when you have enough market share or profit or respect or money? How do you decide what success is?
This matters, because ""never enough"" is the wrong answer to anyone who wants to set realistic budgets or expectations or just plain enjoy the ride.
Too often, we let someone else define success. Critics, for example, want a movie to be only modestly popular and modestly approachable. Geeks want your brand to be new and edgy. Alexa-watchers want you to be bigger than MySpace. Stock analysts want you to beat the numbers that they told you they wanted you to meet. Your boss wants you to show up a lot and work late, regardless of what you actually do for her…
A lot of organizational conflict comes from mismatched expecations of success. A lot of kids live unhappy lives because of unrealistic benchmarking from parents (as popular asthatkid, as attractive asthisone, as smart as the other one…).

More on Tweaking,"My previous post got more mail than just about anything I’ve ever posted before.
As a writer, I’m used to working with editors. A copy editor is a freelancer who fixes my missspellings, my commas and my grammar. A line editor is someone who makes more aggressive changes, adjusting sentences or paragraphs without substantially altering their meaning. And every once in a while, a real editor, who tells me the truth about my writing and encourages me to discard whole chapters or change the rhythm of what I’m working on.
What I found fascinating about the email I got is that a large number of web people are still hung up on the technology side, on getting the code just right and, to use the analogy, the typesetting, not the words. The reason for this is simple: there’s a lot of horrible web coding going on. There are huge gains to be found by overhauling a site and getting the invisible stuff right.
But that’s not the opportunity I was talking about. Instead, I’m talking about turning an arrogant checkout into a useful one by turning off the button that automatically resets to opt in to the spam list every single time I return to the checkout. Or changing the size of the product photo from 144 pixels wide to 500, because making the product the star can triple clickthrough.
This is stuff tweakers know because they do it every day. Because they test and they measure. This is high return on investment knowledge, because it can take hours, not weeks to implement and test.
For example, a small businessperson named Dave writes in and says,
""our website is ok for an electronic sign . . . but its a “factory model” . . . as we maneuver through the curves any business experiences I want to accelerate through those turns because of the edge tweaking provides but I don’t want to get into a complete over-haul to do it … my idea of a “tweaker” is the person who takes us beyond the “factory model” to continue your car and garage analogy . . . someone who says  STOP using this its not working and here’s why START using this it does work and here’s why CONTINUE using this and here’s why. . .""
Tom says, ""My wife and I hired a designer who was a “tweaker.”  She didn’t come in the way most decorators do, with a whole design scheme and lots of new furniture.  She took what we already had, pointed out a few targets of opportunity, moved things around and added a few key elements, and for almost no money gave our house a whole new feel.  It took a couple of days instead of weeks.""
I got plenty of people pointing out that they can’t make a living selling to people like Dave and Tom. That Dave is too hard to reach, too cheap, too uncertain about what he wants… that Tom needs too much handholding.
My response is that it’s not just Tom or Dave. There’s no way Amazon or Eddie Bauer or someone running for the Senate is going to overhaul their site. Certainly no way they’re going to do it every four weeks. It’s too scary. Too disruptive. Too time consuming. Does every site need tweaking? NO, most need an overhaul. But hey, there’s still a lot of sites left that need a tweak, not construction.
The opportunity, as the web becomes more sophisiticated and CSS gets implemented more often, is to figure out how to tweak a page while it’s running and get 2% better response from that page. 2% isn’t a lot–until you multiply it by a million page views.
My original point of the post was that I was looking for a tweaker for a specific page that we haven’t yet launched at Squidoo. The mail I got, though, made it clear that I wasn’t the only one.
I think this market problem isn’t going to solved by a bunch of hungry tweakers making sales calls. Instead, I think those that need tweaking will go out and find the tweakers. So, that said, I’ve starteda lens on tweakers(it’s a unvetted collection of people I heard from) and even better, a Squidoogroup on tweakersthat will allow anyone who wants tweaker business to build a lens and tell the world about what they do. Now, instead of sending me mail about your tweaking services (stop, please!) you can build a lens and reach a lot of people who are looking for you. In the meantime, I’ve got a ton of really cool people to contact about our future stuff. Thanks.",,"tweaking, web optimization, user experience"
Where are the tweakers?,"If I want my car to go a bit faster, there’s a garage in town that will tweak it for me.
If I want my stereo to sound a little better, there’s a guy who will install cables and such and upgrade it.
There are more than a billion websites. Where are the tweakers?
Where are the talented individuals and small firms that want a closed-end engagement… not to completely redesign a site that’s working, not to do any coding, but just to mess with the html and css a bit.
To take their learning from many clients and figure out thatthisworks better thanthat.
To change the look and the feel but not the bones… plastic surgery for websites. Not a lot of meetings, not a lot of belief required. Instead, take the new one, take the old one, do a split test and see which one converts better.

Look me in the eye,"I bought some spinach at the farmer’s market yesterday. The fact that the woman who grew it is the same person as the woman who sold it to me made the transaction fundamentally different than buying the same spinach in a bag at the A&P.

Today, as I was riding my bike along Rt. 9 outside of New York, a teenager in a cream-colored Cadillac Escalade (yes, I got the license plate) threw a bottle at my head. Only a couple inches from serious injury. I’m pretty confident he wouldn’t have done it if he had been required to stand in front of me and look me in the eye when he did.
This is the giant advantage of thesmall.Small organizations have the privilege of looking their customers in the eye. Small doesn’t necessarily mean small in numbers. It’s an attitude. Does your organization require a form to get something done, or does one human choose to interact with another? Does bad news come in the form of memos that obfuscate the truth, or is it delivered face to face?

A little bit of Ford,"Yes, I’m kicking them when they’re down, but it’s important.
A couple of decades ago, Ford had everything. Cash, brand, distribution, political influence, a trained workforce…
Then, through nothing but management hubris and arrogance, they destroyed the company. Making cars is not an unprofitable undertaking, unless you insist on making it one. At just about every turn the company ignored the market, alienated their workforce, distanced themselves from their distribution network, vilified their customers and chose short-term expediency ahead of long-term change. They lobbied to keep gas mileage standards high (doing the opposite would have increased the market for cars). They lobbied to keep SUVs unregulated (and got addicted to a short-term high-profit alternative to cars) and they bought remarkable brands and made them average.
There were hard things they could have chosen to do, things that would have meant change. There were short-term hardships they could have endured to fix their dealer network or reinvent the way they designed and built cars. Instead, they stayed inside the Detroit beltway, played the car game, managed the stock price and paid themselves a fortune.
Monday, when you sit down with your organization to plan the next decade, perhaps you could ask, ""what would the top people at Ford do?"" and then do precisely the opposite.","September 16, 2006","Ford, management failure, long-term strategy"
How to Deal with an Angry Customer,"Every business encounters angry people. Not disappointed or confused, but actually angry. Here are a few steps you might want to try:
[It’s important to note that so far I haven’t asked you to give them anything or to actually agree with their point of view. Just to understand it and recognize it. You cannot negotiate with an angry person. Doesn’t work.]
Bingo. You’ve changed the dynamic. You’ve made it clear which side of the discussion you’re on. You haven’t set any expectations, but you’ve built a connection.
At this point, you have two options. You can describe what you CAN do, right now, in an attempt to make it up to the person. Or you can ask for time and promise to get back to the person after you’ve checked in with the higher-ups.
It’s entirely possible that the steps above won’t work. It’s entirely possible that Sue is so angry she’ll never ever return to your hotel again. That’s okay.

Gotta love those 17th Century Monks,"Estelle Havva points us toBaltasar Gracián y Morales:
""Know how to sell your wares, Intrinsic quality isn’t enough.  Not everyone bites at substance or looks for inner value.  People like to follow the crowd; they go someplace because they  see other people do so.  It takes much skill to explain something’s value.  You can use praise, for  praise arouses desire.  At other times you can give things a good name (but be sure to flee from affectation).  Another trick is to offer something only to those in the know, for everyone believes himself an expert, and the person who isn’t will want to be one.  Never praise things for being easy or common:  you’ll make them seem vulgar and facile.  Everybody goes for something unique.  Uniqueness appeals both to the taste and to the  intellect.""","September 12, 2006","17th Century, Marketing Strategy, Uniqueness"
One Shot Design,"Most design gets a chance to evolve. If you don’t like this can opener, you can buy that one. If you are unfamiliar with how this widget works, you can learn. If an ad doesn’t get response, it can be redesigned and the advertiser can try again.
But some design only gets to be used once. And if it fails, there’s a significant cost. Fire extinguishers, for example, pretty much need to work right away, and the user doesn’t have a lot of selection.
You would think that after the ballot design debacle of 2000 in Florida, ballot designers would have learned this lesson. Today, though, the primary ballot in my precinct in New York looked a little like this (sorry, didn’t have my camera):

This is just wrong.It’s wrong because you expect the jobs to be in the left column and the parties to be across the top. That way, you can find a job (like Senator) and scan along, left to right, the way you are used to, and find the person for that job.Instead, you find the party, scan along and have to find a candidate you recognize, then go up with your eye and try to find the job that sort of matches it. Except the jobs across the top take more than one column (Attorney General took four or five) and it’s really hard to grok the thing. Why is “Tasini” next to “Green”? Unrelated items should not be in the same row.
This is basic stuff, folks. Clearly, ‘ballot designer’ is not a particularly well-trained position. Or difficult to get, either.
My suggestion: I think if it’s important to certify engineers (who build bridges) or pilots (who fly planes), perhaps there should be a certification process for designers who design things that we only get to use once–and that matter.","September 12, 2006","One Shot Design, ballot design, certification"
What’s a trackback?,"Peter writes in with a question that should have a very simple answer.
There at the bottom of every one of my posts (and at the bottom of many other blog’s posts) you’ll see the word ‘trackback’.
Click on it and you’ll see a list of other blogs that have commented on the posting. It’s an effective way to encourage non-anonymous communication between blogs. It’s also a good way to let someone find your blog… by posting your thoughts about blog posts that someone else is already reading… trackbacking your post to the original.
Unfortunately, it’s not that obvious to use. You can see the wikipedia riffhere.
First, if you’ve got blogger, you’re out of luck. Most other kinds of blogging software permit it. Some do an autodetection, so once you start to do a post, it will enable you to just drag down and choose the post you want to track (details here:movabletype.org : TrackBack Explanation.) Others require you to hit the trackback button, copy the trackback URL you see right there, and then paste it into your post (in the field that says ‘trackback field’.)
In Typepad, you’ll find that field if you hit ‘customize’ on your post page. This is needlessly complex, but hey, it’s not my fault.

Doing it for free,"I was reading John Hammond’s biography entry, (John discovered Bob Dylan, Aretha Franklin, Bruce Springsteen and yes, Count Basie) and I noticed that he was independently wealthy.
Woz wasn’t looking to make a lot of money when he invented the Apple computer, and Nolan Bushnell certainly didn’t imagine he was creating the video game industry when he invented Pong. Cory and the rest of theboingboingteam had no revenue for years, and Digg and Yahoo! and dozens of other key websites were started without an eye on profit, never mind revenue. The same thing is true for Julia Child and Gene Roddenberry and Dean Kamen.
In fact, the more I think about it, the more it seems that pioneers are almost never in it for the money. The smart ones figure out how to take a remarkable innovation and turn it into a living (or a bigger than big payout) but not the other way around. I think the reason is pretty obvious: when you try to make a profit from your innovation, you stop innovating too soon. You take the short payout because it’s too hard to stick around for the later one.
Irony #1 is that business journalists always ask pioneers about the money. And then they are incredulous when they hear the answer. They make up bogus numbers or just assume the pioneer is lying. They don’t see the trend.
The second irony is that people who want to join the pioneers are often focused on a steady paycheck and juicy options… they would probably be better off seeking the edgiest thing they can find, run by the most devoted visionary.","September 10, 2006","pioneers, innovation, profit"

This works for Harley-Davidson (and certainly the Hells Angels). It works for the latest teenage trends. It works for some politicians. It even works for some computer operating systems and languages.
According to theTimes,the Zoroastrians are fading away because they believe being good is just about enough and didn’t build enough of the elements of an ideavirus into their culture. As they traveled the world, their attitude and hard work rewarded them with success and the ability to mix with other cultures. As a result, they were successful as a people but a failure as a long-term growing religion. It’s a fascinating choice, isn’t it?","September 6, 2006","Zoroastrians, ideaviruses, religion"

The end of the job interview,"Let’s assert that there are two kinds of jobs you need to fill:
The first kind of job is a cog job. A job where you need someone to perform a measurable task and to follow instructions. This can range from stuffing envelopes to performing blood tests. It’s a profitable task if the person is productive, and you need to find a reliable, skilled person to do what you need.
The second kind of job requires insight and creativity. This job relies on someone doing something you could never imagine in advance, producing outcomes better than you had hoped for. This might include a sales job, or someone rearranging the factory floor to increase productivity. It could also include a skilled craftsperson or even a particularly skilled receptionist.
If you’re hiring for the first kind of job, exactly why are you sitting a nervous candidate down in your office and asking her to put on some sort of demonstration in her ability to interact with strangers under pressure? Why do you care what his suit looks like or whether or not he can look you in the eye?
Years ago, in order to keep the ethnic balance at Harvard the way some trustees felt was correct, the school created interviews and essays as a not-so-subtle way to weed out the undesirables. This spread to just about every college in the country, and persists to this day, even though it’s a largely discredited way to determine anything. Your company is probably doing exactly the same thing. If someone can do the cog job, what other information are you looking for? Why?
And if you’re hiring for the second kind of job, the question becomes even more interesting. Would you marry someone based on a one hour interview in a singles bar? And how does repeating the forced awkwardness of an interview across your entire team help you choose which people are going to dothe extraordinary work you’re banking on?
I’ve been to thousands of job interviews (thankfully as an interviewer mostly) and I have come to the conclusion that the entire effort is a waste of time.
At least half the interview finds the interviewer giving an unplanned and not very good overview of what the applicant should expect from this job. Unlike most of the marketing communications the organization does, this spiel is unvetted, unnatural and unmeasured. No one has ever sat down and said, “when we say X, is it likely the applicant understands what we mean? Are we putting our best foot forward? Does it make it more likely that the right people will want to work here, for the right reasons?” [tell the truth, do you test your job interview spiel the same way you test your web results or even your direct mail?]
The other half is dedicated to figuring out whether the applicant is good at job interviews or not.
I should have learned this lesson in 1981, when my partner and I (and three of our managers) hired Susan, who was perhaps the best interviewer I have ever met. And one of the worst employees we ever hired. Too bad we didn’t have a division that sold interviews.
Let me be clear about what I’m recommending: the next time someone asks you to “sit in” on an interview, just say no. Don’t do it. Don’t waste your time or theirs.
So, what should you do instead?
Glad you asked!
First, none of this will work if you’re not offering a great job at a great company for fair pay. These techniques will not succeed if you are the employer of last resort. Assuming that’s not the case, how about his:
Every applicant gets a guided tour of your story. Maybe from a website or lens or DVD. Maybe from one person in your organization who is really good at this. It might mean a plant tour or watching an interview with the CEO. It might involve spending an hour sitting in one of your stores or following one of your doctors around on her rounds. But it’s a measurable event, something you can evaluate after the process is over. If you’re hiring more than a few people a week, clearly it’s worth having a full-time person to do this task and do it well.
There are noone-on-one-sit-in-my-office-and-let’s-talkinterviews. Boom, you just saved 7 hours per interview. Instead, spend those seven hours actually doing the work. Put the person on a team and have a brainstorming session, or design a widget or make some espressos together. If you want to hire a copywriter, do some copywriting. Send back some edits and see how they’re received.
If the person is really great, hire them. For a weekend. Pay them to spend another 20 hours pushing their way through something. Get them involved with the people they’ll actually be working with and find out how it goes. Not just the outcomes, but the process. Does their behavior and insight change the game for the better? If they want to be in sales, go on a sales call with them. Not a trial run, but a real one. If they want to be a rabbi, have them give a sermon or visit a hospital.
Yes, people change after you hire them. They always do. But do they change more after an unrealistic office interview or after you’ve actually watched them get in the cage and tame a lion?","September 4, 2006","job interviews, hiring process, assessment techniques"

Compromise: How to make breakfast,"A creature of habit, I have just about exactly the same thing for breakfast every day, especially when I’m on the road.
Here it is. An egg white omelet, made in a cast-iron skillet with fresh herbs and a whole wheat tortilla. Sometimes I add some peppers from the farmer’s market or whatever looks good. It takes me less than six minutes, start to finish, including clean up, to make breakfast.
If you run a hotel (the sort of hotel that charges $15 for breakfast) you might have a few questions. Here we go:
Can we use a standard restaurant skillet? The cast iron is too hard to clean.Of course you can. If you do, you’ll end up with eggs that have no real color and are a little flaccid, but it’ll work.
Can we use a portable propane burner instead of a real stove? It’s easier for us.Of course you can. If you do, though, you won’t have a lot of heat and it’ll take a long time and not taste as good.
Do we have to use fresh herbs? That’ll add more than $3 a day to our costs.Of course you don’t have to use fresh herbs. The eggs won’t taste as good, naturally.
Whole wheat tortilla? Most of our guests are satisfied with toasted Wonder bread, which is a lotcheaper and comes in a big loaf.Sure, you can use that, but I’m not going to eat it.
I notice your omelet is sort of big… our policy is to only use three eggs, so if you want an egg-whiteomelet, it’s going to be pretty tiny. It’s not fair to give you more eggs, because it’s the same price as the regular omelet. Is that okay?Well, since eggs cost you 8 cents each, I can understand your desire to standardize and keep your costs really low. So, sure, go ahead.
You used fresh veggies as a garnish. Even though you ordered a healthy protein, we’re going to give you hash browns as a garnish, because that’s what everyone gets. Okay?Sure, whatever.
You mentioned the farmer’s market. We get a delivery every day from Sysco, and if it’s not on thetruck, we can’t serve it… it takes too much time to go to a farmer’s market. You understand, right?Yep.
Please come again to our expensive restaurant! It’s a purple cow! It’s remarkable! Because we said so.
Once you start compromising, when do you stop?
If your goal is to be remarkable, please understand that the easiest way to do that is to compromise less, not more. And no, this wasn’t a post about breakfast.","September 1, 2006","compromise, breakfast, restaurant"

Too important to be left to professionals,"Robert DeNiro called me today. Or as his friends call him, Bobby.
Of course, I don’t call him Bobby because I’m not his friend. We’ve never met. He was calling to promote a politician. And it wasn’t really him, it was a tape. And I don’t know which politician because I hung up.
I’ve gotten dozens of phone calls over the last few weeks, including one just now from an eager fundraiser named Barbara. She explained that she’d even read my books, includingPermission Marketing. ""Even the part about spam?"" I asked. I don’t think she got the point.
The point, folks, is that with all these strangers calling me, interrupting my day, giving me unanticipated, impersonal, irrelevant come-ons, not one person I know personally has called me. And not one of the callers has tried to enlist me to call my friends.
One call from a friend is worth 100 calls from an Academy-Award winner on tape.
The mistake politicians, like most marketers, make is that they think that what they are doing is way too important. Too important to leave to citizens. Too important to leave to ordinary people who happen to be big fans with organic, authentic networks of trusted friends. Too important to respect social boundaries.

Yes Substitutions,"This, of course, is the opposite of ""no substitutions"".
I had lunch at the Pump in NY today. The Pump is about 350 square feet (total) and it’s a money factory.

Or no pita, double egg whites, double hot sauce and brown rice.
People who care about what they eat go somewhere on purpose. People who don’t care, go close or cheap.
There’s a line out the door of the Pump every day at lunch. Why? Because people who love substitutions (the picky ones) go blocks out of their way to eat here. Is there anyone clamoring to get into the ""no substitutions"" place?",,"Substitutions, Healthy Eating, Consumer Behavior"
"Ponzi, Pyramids, MLM, Ads and WOM…","There’s been a lot of angry mail about my mention of mmmzr the other day. ""It’s aponzi scheme!"" several people say.
Actually, no, it’s not. It’s a pyramid scheme. They’re different, and it’s part of a spectrum, one worth understanding.
A Ponzi scheme is a simple scam in which a bankrolled, charismatic individual persuades some people to invest money in a financial instrument. The investors do nothing but wait for a return. Soon, they get paid off! The buzz is incredible. New investors come in. The scammer now uses the new money to give more returns to the original money. This increasing return further increases buzz, which leads to ever more money coming in, which he uses to pay off newer investors, and so on, until finally there’s a lot of money coming in and the scammer leaves town.
Everyone hates a Ponzi scheme. The only people who fall for it are the ones who don’t know what’s actually happening.
A pyramid scheme is different. That’s a scheme where the investors actually have to do something. There was a classic pyramid scheme floating around twenty years ago. You started as a ‘passenger’ and invested $1,000. Your job was to find five new passengers, which made you a ‘flight attendant’ and then a ‘co pilot’ and finally a ‘pilot’. I forget the specifics, but I think pilots ended up with $100,000 or so. Obviously, this can’t last forever, but if you can recruit diligent passengers, you can make it work (for a while).
Most people shy away from pyramid schemes. They seem too calculated and unfair and risky.
The next kind of pyramid scheme is certain kinds of MLM (vitamins, often) and yes, mmmzr. In this case, in addition to having the attributes of a pyramid scheme (the investors have to work), there’s also an attractive side benefit. You get the energy bars or the web traffic or the perfume or the herbs. The product often hides the underlying structure of the business, but in particularly loud versions, it’s pretty clear it’s just a pyramid scheme.
Once again, most people don’t like this. You cringe when your sister-in-law brings it up. You hide in the conference room when your co-worker takes out his sample case. It feels wrong, and it largely is. It is because the motivation of the seller is primarily selfish.
Selfish because she’s trying to build her downline. Selfish because the entire focus of the enterprise is to make the enterprise bigger.
I contrast this to more subtle projects like Tupperware or Avon, or various religions or things like Digg (when it’s used right). In those cases, the ‘side benefits’ are actually the real benefits. The commissions are just a side light. The word of mouth feels a lot more real, because the person you’re working with is obviously impassioned for the right reason.
Great real estate brokers already have enough money to retire. They’re not selling you a house just to make a few percentage points. They’re doing it because it actually gives them joy to get you into a better house.
Human kindness has always been in short supply. For millenia, you needed to worry when someone offered to do something nice for you. You needed to wonder what the ulterior motive was, what’s in it for them. As a result, we’re innately suspicious whenever we get sold something.
I had an interesting dilemma before I posted on mmmzr. I had a hunch it would work, especially if I pointed to it on my blog. Should I buy a bunch of boxes for some charities I support? After all, it would generate traffic for the charity, and probably pay off with money I could turn around and donate. But if I did, if I did that, then my newer readers would say, ""hey, I knew it! You pointed that out because there was something in it for you…"" So I didn’t.
Word of Mouth is a really fragile entity. Someone asked me at a recent engagement what I thought about various agencies that are paying people to shill for their products. I said something like, ""Well, for a long time the oldest profession has taken money for what other people do for free. How do you feel about the difference between the two transactions? Which kind of person did you marry?""
At some level, at a very major level in fact, the way we feel about a transaction is more important than the transaction itself. Some people like a sporting event more if they got the ticket from a scalper, other if they got the ticket for free from their boss. Some people need to feel like they’ve taken the system (whatever the system is) for everything it’s worth. Others need to pay retail (especially on a wedding dress, cemetery plot or flu shot).
Marketers are working hard to corrupt the way we feel about our friends and the people we respect. I think, in the end, it’s not going to work. We’re hardwired to respect real authenticity, and at some level, that means trusting the motives of the person we’re listening to.
Bottom line: just because the net makes it much easier to measure things, share things, create downlines and hierarchies and yes, scams, doesn’t mean its the best way to make something that lasts.","October 29, 2006","Ponzi scheme, pyramid scheme, MLM"

Is this spam? Of course it is. Targeted spam, but still spam. I wrote back to Talia… her email bounced. Is there really a Tania?
Then I found a blog that had hit high onDiggtoday. It was a rant about flooding YouTube with spam. The thing is, the rant was sort of dumb and ill-thought through, and the blogger had more than 20 comments, with more than 95% pointing out what a yutz he was. Yet he had hundreds of Diggs. How? He had manipulated the system, pushed himself up to the top of the chart in a successful attempt to get a bunch of traffic to his site (and probably to promote the very videos he was ranting about).
If you only need to influence 500 people (or 10 people pretending to be 50 different people each) in order to show up on the screens of tens of thousands people… that’s too tempting for most capitalists to ignore (politicians are next, for sure).
Every day, there are literally hundreds of ad agencies working hard, trying to figure out how to slip corporate ideas into the system under the guise of it being homemade and real. They don’t have remarkable products or services, they don’t have clients willing to reconsider what it is they actually produce, so they’re busy trying to break the community systems online to help them (selfishly) succeed.
When a kid in New Jersey does theNuma Numasong, it’s poignant and funny and yes, remarkable. When an ad agency creates 100 variations of a gimmicky video hoping to hit the Digg jackpot, it just feels wrong.
As the ‘bestseller’ lists on YouTube andRedditand other places become more and more important, they’re also going to become less useful. Less useful because the manipulators are way more focused and earnest than the typical consumer, and they’ll figure out a way to get under whatever radar gets installed.
At some point, it’s going to come down to who we trust. We didn’t trust Beechnut after we find out they put water in the apple juice. We didn’t trustAudifor a decade, even though there wasn’t anything actually wrong with their car. And we won’t trust Enron, Worldcom or Adelphia with our money for a long time to come.
It’s not just that this sort of deception is morally wrong. It’s also stupid. It’s stupid because it poisons the water supply for everyone, including the marketers who are busy doing it. Instead of realizing that they have an incredible playground in which to launch things that are truly innovative, they’d rather kill it by bending (or breaking) the rules.
It’s too bad, really.
And the upside? The upside is that individuals (and organizations) that don’t stoop, that manage to figure out how to have influence without trying to profit from it, those brands are the ones that will last, that will thrive and that will bring the rarest commodity–trust–to the table.",,"manipulation, marketing, trust"
The 249% solution,"Usama Fayyad is a genuine rocket scientist. He now runs the Strategic Data Solutions (which includes data mining) division of Yahoo, and he shared some astounding numbers with me today.
There’s one big insight that ought to change everything for anyone who buys clicks online. Here goes:If you run banner ads, one study for Harris Direct shows that you can increase your brand awareness about 7% after a reasonable buy of banner ads. That’s just fine, though I’m on the record as saying that most banner campaigns are a waste of money. The kicker? In the study, Harris did the banner buy and watched the number of clicks to their contextual ad (you know, the text ads) go up by 249% over the next week.
Pow.
This means that someone answering the ‘brand awareness’ survey says, “no, I never heard of them,” but then, two days later, is more than twice as likely to click on their text ad.

Where did it all go?,"According to a recent report, more than two-thirds of recent immigrants to the USA send money home regularly. The worst-paid, poorest people in the country manage to save enough to send some back to the old country.The US Ambassador from El Salvador says that the two million Salvadorians in the U.S. sent enough money home to account for 13 percentof the GDP of his country.
At the same time, nearly two-thirds of American households are in debt. Many of them in serious debt.

The two things that kill marketing creativity,"The first is fear.
The fear that you’ll have to implement whatever you dream up.The fear that you will fail.The fear that you will do something stupid and be ridiculed by your peers for decades.The fear that you’ll get fired.The fear that there will be an unanticipated backlash associated with your idea.The fear of change.The fear of missing out on the thing you won’t be able to do if you do this.
The second is a lack of imagination.
I believe that every single person I’ve met in this profession is capable of astounding creativity. That you, and everyone else for that matter, is able to dream up something radical and viral and yes, remarkable. So why doesn’t it happen more often? Sure, fear is a big part, but it’s also a lack of imagination.
Basically, most people don’t believe something better can occur. They believe that the status quo is also the best they can do. So they don’t look. They don’t push. They don’t ask, ""what else?"" and ""what now?"" They settle.
Fear is an emotion and it’s impossible to counter an emotion with logic. So you need to mount emotional arguments for why your fear of the new is the thing you truly need to fear.

The silver-grey Japanese car syndrome,"I found myself on the Jersey side of the Hudson, riding past a row of new townhouses overlooking New York City. Each townhouse had a single carport facing the road.
As I rode past, I noticed that every single carport, more than forty in all, had a similar car parked in it. Either grey or silver or a mix of the two. Either a lower-model Mercedes or more likely, a Toyota or a Honda.Every single one.It wasn’t until the 40th unit that I saw a red car, and a few later that I saw a pickup truck.
This is the power of demographics. This is the power of data mining.
Your choice of car shouldn’t tell us anything about what sort of neighborhood you’d like to live in, or who you will vote for in the next election. The kind of clothing you wear should have no influence at all on the kind of wine you prefer. But it does.
I don’t know which came first, the car or the townhouse, but the co-incidence of the two is unmistakeable.
This matters. It matters because the marketers at the townhouse ought to seriously consider a co-promotion with certain car dealers, and it matters because it opens a window for marketers. If people who buy novels also buy red wine, marketing your red wine in a bookstore might not be so dumb.
If you’re marketing a product or service in a cluttered marketplace, it may cost too much or be too difficult to reach the right person at the right time. Marketing red wine in a bar is intellectually compelling, but awfully expensive. But if you understand the data mining implications of the other habits of your typical prospect, you can reach those people somewhere else or sometime else.
For example, when I do a search on ""grey toyota new york"", there is plenty of unsold Google inventory, which means you can buy clicks here really cheap. So why not run an ad that says,LOOKING FOR A GREAT PLACE TO LIVE?
This violates some of the precepts ofpermission marketing. It’s not anticipated. But it is likely to be personal and relevant, and even better, you don’t pay unless someone clicks.
Will this work for you? I have no idea. The chances that you’ll find the perfect match are unlikely. But if you do, the pay off can be significant.",,"demographics, marketing, data mining"

Top 10 Secrets of the Marketing Process,"If myprevious postconfused you, it’s because of the difference between tactics and innovation. Try these 10 ideas to get you started down the path of scientific marketing tactics:
1. Don’t run out of money.It always takes longer and costs more than you expect to spread your idea. You can budget for it or you can fail.2. You won’t get it right the first time.Your campaign will need to be reinvented, adjusted or scrapped. Count on it.
3. Convenient choices are not often the best choices.Just because an agency, an asset or a bizdev deal are easy to do doesn’t mean that they are your best choice.4. Irrational, strongly held beliefs of close advisors should be ignored.It doesn’t matter if they don’t like your logo.5. If it makes you nervous, it’s probably a good idea.If you’re sure you’re right, you probably aren’t.
6. Focusing obsessivelyon one niche, one feature and one market is almost always a better idea than trying to satisfy everyone.
7. At some point, you’re either going to have to stick to your convictions or do what the market tells you.It’s hard to do both.8. Compromise in marketing is almost always a bad idea.Extreme A could work. Extreme B could work. The average of A and B will almost never work.
9. Test, measure and optimize.Figure out what’s working and do it more.10. Read and learn.There are a million clues, case studies, books and proven tactics out there. You can’t profitably ignore them until you know them, and you don’t have the time or the money to make the same mistake someone else made last week. It’s cheaper and faster to read about it than it is to do it.","October 20, 2006","Marketing, Tactics, Optimization"
Nobody Knows Anything,"There are two kinds of marketing analysis, both pretty useless.
The first kind is done before the fact. This is when you and your team (and your advisors and your mother in law) weigh in about whether your ad, your product, your uniforms and your logo are any good. Call it ‘analyzing tomorrow’.
Analyzing tomorrow is a sort of analysis is filled with superstition, unsupported opinion, half-truths and most of all, fear. Fear of being wrong, fear of challenging the status quo, fear of going out on a limb. Fear of wasting money, fear of criticism and fear of the market.
Analyzing tomorrow is the province of consultants and pundits. People who predict what will work and what won’t, and are eager to tell you what you must do (and not do).
The other kind, of course, is called ‘analyzing yesterday.’ Analyzing yesterday is 20/20 hindsight. It involves finding threads of ‘tomorrow’ analysis and hooking them up to things that appear to have worked. Using yesterday analysis, I can easily explain the success of Starbucks and Apple and Nike and Google, and of course make it really clear why Friendster didn’t become Myspace.
Except, of course, I’d be lying.
The great thing about science, about proven fields like physics and evolution and chemistry, is that science works. A physicist is never going to be wrong about her prediction of what a spaceship on the other side of the moon is going to do. And when ten chemists analyze why a formula failed, all of them will give you the same (correct) answer.
Marketing, then, is not science.
Sure, there are principles. Trends, even. That’s why reading my stuff isn’t a total waste of time (I hope). The idea, though, that you can accurately analyze tomorrow just because some marketer did a good of describing yesterday is nonsense.
A nice side effect of the gurucomplex is that sometimes reading a marketing tract can give you the confidence to do what you knew was the right thing anyway. And sometimes listening to a marketing pundit can spark an idea that leads to a real breakthrough.
Here’s the really good news: in addition to analysis, marketing today offers something that actually works: a process.
The successful marketing process will always get you better results than the alternatives. The successful marketing process is not dependent on an historical analysis of what your competition did that worked, but is a truly powerful way to figure out what to do next. I think most marketing breakthroughs come down, sooner or later, to luck. But just as a gambler in Vegas can improve his luck, so can you.",,"Marketing analysis, Analyzing tomorrow, Successful marketing process"

Lazy people in a hurry…,"I just had an interesting email exchange with John, and we concluded that this is often the target market.
You’re busy trying to sell a service or a product or an idea to lazy people in a hurry.
Lazy, as in not willing to do the work to create long term benefits. Lazy as in not willing to read the instructions, follow the manual, do all the steps, invest the time in the research. Lazy as in willing to buy the first choice that’s ‘good enough’ as opposed to finding the best choice. These are people who will spend five minutes to find a parking space one minute closer to the mall.

In a hurry because they jump to conclusions, don’t read to the end, and most of all, most of the time, search for a shortcut.

The accidental marketer,"Marketers and designers will be quick to tell you that marketing and design are critical to the success of any venture.
That’s why it’s so sad/disturbing/surprising/wonderful to discover that so many successful ventures were created by amateurs. Yes, they were professionals at something (coding, perhaps, or raising money or managing or even selling) but the marketing and design was not created by a ‘professional’.
The list is long, and runs from the Boy Scouts to Google, from Nike to the New York Yankees.
One possible lesson is that marketing is easy.
The other, more likely lesson is that marketing is way too important to be left to professionals. Every person is a marketer, and anyone crazy enough and passionate enough to start something isdefinitelya marketer.

Why do people look like their dogs?,"It’s more than just a fewsilly pictures. It’s a big insight that helps you understand why people (and businesses) buy what they buy.
They do it because it validates them.
Corporations prefer to buy from other organizations that make them feel safe and secure and important. That means a big bank has an advantage writing a loan to a company that thinks of itself as big. It means that a fashionable laptop is easier to sell to someone who sees herself as fashionable.
""Duh,"" you say.
Sure, it’s obvious, but it’s not easy. It’s not easy because more often than not, marketers are busy marketing things thattheywould want to buy, not that their customers would prefer. Simple dog example: animal shelters are run by volunteers who hate the idea of dog shelters and having to kill strays. So that’s the way they market. ""Adopt this dog or it might get killed! It might happen Monday! Hurry!""
But dog buyers aren’t always motivated that way. They like the idea of cute puppies and warm, comforting, fashionable environments. When the North Shore Animal League tells someone that this pupply is a ""golden retreiver mix"", they are breaking the typical shelter marketing mantra and instead telling that dog buyer exactly what they want to hear.

Here’s what I think: Cheaper is the last refuge of the person who’s not a very good marketer. Cheaper is easy and cheaper is fast and cheaper is linear and cheaper is easy to do properly, at least at first. But cheaper doesn’t spread the word (unless you are much cheaper, but to be much cheaper, you need to be organized from the ground up, like Walmart or JetBlue, to be cheaper). They are, you’re not.
Cheaper is a short term hit, not a long term advantage. Cheaper doesn’t create loyalty, because the other guy can always figure out how to be cheaper still, at least in the short run.
Even free isn’t cheap enough to win in the long run. Not if other people can figure out how to match what you’ve got.
So, if you can’t be cheaper, be better.","October 9, 2006","Cheaper, Marketing, Value"

Lessons learned from Columbus,"Cristóbal Colón, marketer.Columbus failed early and often.He failed when he joined in the attempt to conqure the Kingdom of Naples. Later, he was captured by Portuguese ships as he escorted an armed convoy. He was wounded. And he never did get to India. The fact that he didn’t give up and become a shopkeeper after this rough start was critical to his success.
Columbus was a thief.He didn’t invent the idea that the world was round. In fact, Ertosthenes, Aristotle and Ptolemy pretty much made it an established fact among educated people long before Columbus was born. Just because he didn’t invent the idea doesn’t mean he couldn’t use it.
Columbus didn’t do his research carefully, reinforcing his optimism.He thought that calculations of the size of the Earth were in Italian miles, not in the longer Arabic miles. The correct calculations would have ‘proven’ he should never have left.
Columbus took advantage of human nature.The rulers of Spain were desperate to find an edge and Columbus offered them a quest that could address their state of emergency.
Columbus was persistent.It took him seven years at court in order to get funding.No one really believed that Columbus would change everything. His contract with the king included huge bonuses for success, largely because they were pretty sure that he would fail.
Columbus didn’t consider side affects until it was too late.In order to help repay his investors, Columbus took slaves (the first person to do so in the New World) and in one notorious case, arranged to cut the hands off of each Haitian adult male who failed to bring a minimum amount of gold to his ships.
Ultimately, in death,Columbus became a brand,a story bigger than his own facts. Buried in Spain, moved to Santo Domingo, then to Havana and then back to Spain. Namesake of the Knights of Columbus. Honored by statues and streets and even cities. In many ways considered the ""first American,"" demonstrating vision, persistence, insight, brilliance, bravery and world changing paradigm shifting… almost none of it true, of course.
I think the lesson of Columbus Day is a marketing lesson.Successfulmarketers allow people to tell themselves a story they want to hear. Columbus did that his entire life, and especially in death.Greatmarketers then do work that they’re proud of, using their leverage to create things that people might not want in the short run, but are delighted in later on. I think Columbus was certainly successful. I wonder what would have happened if he had been great.","October 8, 2006","Columbus, marketing, persistence"

50:1,"Every month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks “mass layoffs.” That’s the term for more than 50 people losing their jobs at once. In August of this year, the total number of people hit by a mass layoff was 127,944. The number has been more than 100,000 every month except for one in the last decade.
And that doesn’t count small companies, smaller lay offs, non-profits and other ventures that don’t show up on the radar. The actual number has to be at least ten times as big–at least a million a month is my guess .
Compare that to the tiny number of people who get fired for attempting to do something great.
Sure, the CEO got fired. But thousands at the company got laid off. She lost her job for challenging the status quo. They got canned for embracing it.
Sure, that crazy copywriter on the 11th floor got fired for attempting a viral blog-based campaign that backfired, but it’s nothing compared to the entire department that lost their jobs because there just wasn’t enough business.
At least once a day, I get mail from people worrying that if they are too remarkable, too edgy, too willing to cause change and growth… they’re risking getting fired. I almost never get mail from people who figure that if they keep doing the same boring thing day in and day out at their fading company that they’re going to lose their jobs in a layoff.

Outsiders and the group,"Political activistPaul Weyrichon NPR yesterday:It has been known for many years that Congressman Foleywas a homosexual. Homosexuals tend to be preoccupied with sex – theidea that he should be continued, or should have been continued aschairman on the Committee for Missing and Exploited Children, given their knowledge of that is just outrageous.
What’s the point of such outrageous homophobia? Even if he believes what he’s saying, why say it? Why go out of your way to demonize 10% of the population?
Not just in politics but in other forms of marketing, there’s a frequent need to identify and demonize the outsider. If there are outsiders, after all, then you’re an insider. Apple Computer worked hard to make IBM PC users into outsiders.
At the same time, there’s a similar but opposite impulse: to do what everyone else is doing. That’s part of the reason the iPod is so successful… because it’s so successful. The Times reported on Wednesday about teenagers who are buying other, lesser MP3 players just so they can avoid being part of the masses.
Playing insider/outsider games is dangerous indeed. But it’s been part of marketing for thousands of years–tribes and religions have used it forever.

Listen to this…,"What’s the point of talking to a group?
I’m serious. We spend a lot of time in presentations, or at the United Nations, or sending our kids to school. We have orientation sessions and keynote speeches and long-winded oratory on the floor the Senate. Why?
One reason: to incite. To share emotion. To sell. And that’s never going to go out of fashion, as far as I can tell.
But most of the speeches I’m talking about don’t incite. I heard an excerpt on the radio the other day… someone at the EU going on at length about admitting Romania and Bulgaria to the EU. There was even a mention of food safety issues. Thousands of people listening to one person drone on about food safety. This wasn’t an emotional speech designed to sell us on an idea. Instead, it was designed to teach us.
To teach us the way a schoolteacher I heard recently teaches: by reading a text. She stands up at the front of the room, and along with a few web images, reads a text to the class.
Here’s my point: In our scan and skip world, in a world where technology makes it obvious that we can treat different people differently, how can we possibly justify teaching via a speech?
Speech is both linear and unpaceable. You can’t skip around and you can’t speed it up. When the speaker covers something you know, you are bored. When he quickly covers something you don’t understand, you are lost.
If marketing is the art of spreading ideas, then teaching is a kind of marketing. And teaching to groups verbally is broken, perhaps beyond repair. Consumers of information won’t stand for it. We’re learning less every time we are confronted with this technique, because we’ve been spoiled by the remote control and the web.
If you teach–teach anything–I think you need to start by acknowledging that there’s a need to sell your ideas emotionally. So you need to use whatever tools are available to you–an evocative powerpoint image, say, or a truly impassioned speech.
Then, and this is the hard part, if you’re teaching to a group of more than three people, you need to find a way to engage that is non-linear. Q&A doesn’t work for a large group, because only the questioner is engaged at any given moment (if you’re lucky, the questioner represents more than a few, but she rarely represents all).
If it’s worth teaching, it’s worth teaching well. If it’s worth investing the time of 30 or 230 or 3330 people, then it’s worth investing the effort to actually figure out how to get the message across. School is broken. Legislative politics are broken. Linear is broken. YouTube and Bloglines, on the other hand, are new platforms, platforms that enable the education of millions of people every day, quickly and for free.","October 1, 2006","presentation, teaching, engagement"

Warts and all,"She doesn’t really look like this. Especially in the morning or after a long plane flight. And yet we’re bombarded by photos of one perfect celebrity after another… enough to buy into the fantasy that they’re allperfect.
Businesses are the same way. If you read enough stories, it’s easy to believe that Starbucks and Apple and the rest of the all-star list somehow manage to effortlessly create remarkable products and happy customers.
One thread that has become clear to me from reading my email is that there are no perfect companies, no ideal places to work, no marketers who always manage to please their customers.
The danger in celebrity worship is that it can persuade you not to bother trying. After all, the thinking goes, our organization is so thoroughly screwed up that we’ve never got a chance to be like them, so why bother? In fact, organizations like Apple struggled for years, and continue to struggle… it’s just that the facade matches our need to believe, so we ignore that part.

How to get referrals,"There’s been thousands of pages written about this topic, but still, no luck. It’s too hard.
Yes, we know that referrals are the very best way to grow your business.
And we know that asking for a referral is both scary but apparently the most effective technique.
And we know that excellent service is a great place to start.
But still, not enough referrals. How come?
First, marketers often forget to look at this from the consumer’s point of view. Why on earth should I give you a referral? Yes, I know it’s important to you, but why is it important to me?
And second, I have a lot to lose if I refer a friend to you. You might screw up, in which case she’ll hate me. Or you might somehow do something that, through no fault of your own, disappoints. If I recommend a greek restaurant and my friend goes and they don’t have skordalia, and she loves skordalia… oops.
And third, the act of recommending you isn’t easy. It’s not easy to recommend a tailor to make your co-worker look a little less shabby. It’s not easy to bring up the fact that you have a great psychiatrist or even a particularly wonderful (but very expensive) shoe store.

No Cake!,"Every organizationtells a story, want to or not.
Two ways of thinking about flying yesterday.
Thousands of people descend on JetBlue. The JetBlue team decides to tell a story about confidence and empathy, about competence and kindness. They staff the security line with talented people, they plan a route through the terminal, they figure out what the TSA is going to want.
End result: fast lines, happy employees, loyal customers.
Just on the other side of the line are the bureaucrats at the TSA. They tell a story too, but it couldn’t be intentional.
""No Cake!"" the screener yells. ""No pie either!"" and they make the person traveling to her family throw out her home-baked cake.
We got up to the line. I had an ounce of gel left in a five ounce bottle. They made me throw it out because the label said 5 ounces (though it was clearly more than half empty).
The story?
No Cake!
Is this the sort of government we want? We deserve? We should pay for?
The easy thing for me to do is say nothing. It makes me seem like a whiner, after all. But to stand by while all of us spend billions of dollars a year chasing the wrong thing, doing it poorly and telling exactly the wrong story is far worse than that.
There are 583 ways to hurt yourself and your fellow passengers onboard an airplane. Gel (and cake) are exactly two of them. How many more are we going to protect ourselves against? If the best our bureaucracy can do is scare us with cries of ""No Cake!"" and ""too much gel,"" then I think we need a new bureaucracy.
More important from a safety point of view, we need a new story. One that simulateously scares the bad guys without crippling the rest of us. Yes, the TSA’s failure is a marketing failure. If you work there, drop me a line and I’ll send you a book.",,"TSA, bureaucracy, storytelling"

Just down the highway, there’s a line in front of Pearl’s restaurant every night before it opens.

Isn’t making what everyone needs the best way to succeed?
It’s easy to fall into the trap of trying to satisfy a large need for a large group of people. The problem is that this leaves out the other half of the equation. Who’s looking?
The reason for almost all marketing successes is the overlap between the media (whether it’s a tv show, a commercial, YouTube or one high school kid talking to another) and the product. Selling beer during TV football, for example, is a successful matchup.
It’s not an accident that YouTube is filled with scatalogical humor. The people most likely to make YouTube videos like that sort of thing. Flu shots, on the other hand, are hard to market to the audience that needs them because that market (over 50, recently ill, small children) isn’t choosing to pay attention to the media that is talking about the shots.
Before you embrace your wonderful solution to the marketplace’s problem, first decide how many of consumers are choosing to listen to messages like yours. Are they listening in a medium you can afford?",,"marketing, audience, product"
The success of Wii,"A long time ago, Ipostedabout Nintendo’s choice of a name for the Wii.
Others have noted that there’s far less of a frenzy about the Wii than the new PlayStation. Sony is losing hundreds of dollars on every one they sell, supply is limited and, straight out ofJennifer Government, people are getting shot in the frenzy to buy the game.
And yet Nintendo hums along, with great reviews, plenty of supply and a long-term hit on their hands.
What’s up?
All marketers make choices. And those choices need to be consistent. Nintendo is not trying to reach hard core gamers, and so they’re consistently building a process that will lead to long-term success. Just as the Gameboy was disrespected for its technical shortcomings (but sold and sold and sold for a decade) the Wii is following a similar path. Just because it’s not a product for the loudest, most devout fans of gaming doesn’t mean it’s not a brilliant product.

A friend in need,"Rick writes:
Yesterday on her way to work, my wife had a flat tire at the post office. She coaxed her car to the nearest tire shop to see if they could fix the tire, we’d already ruined the spare, Wal-Mart couldn’t repair it when IT went flat a couple of weeks ago. (Funny how there’s never time to fix a spare tire!)
Our little tire shop repaired her tire and had her on her way in a few minutes. Now, we’ve just moved to this small Texas town, and though we’ve lived in Texas for years, what happened next still took me a bit by surprise. My wife inquired about payment, and they wouldn’t hear of it- she needed help and they gave it to her. Well, she decided it was time for some new tires and told them she’d be back in the morning for two.
I went with her this morning for the new tires, and what do you know- on a banner in the front window they proudly proclaimed- ""Voted best tire store in Central Texas 2004"". Wouldn’t you know it. And the total bill for the two tires was about $20 less than Sam’s, took less time, and we had a fun chatting with the employees. Yeppers, small IS the new big.
The funny thing is that I had a blowout this week as well. And I hadpreciselythe same experience.

Alright, I am gonna dote on my company for a few minutes. As most everyone on here is probably familiar with, last night was a nightmare for people travelling to and from the Northeast. We currently have 5 flights a day from CMH, 4 to/from JFK and 1 to/from BOS. Last night, out of CMH alone, Delta cancelled 3 flights, American cancelled 2, and Continental cancelled 1 and those are just flights that I know of. After we found out that our flight was delayed until 2223, the captain and the rest of us station employees decided to pool our money and we purchased pizza for all passengers on board our aircraft. Since the pizza place wouldn’t deliver to the airport, one of our crewmembers volunteered to go pick it up. Once the pizza was brought back, the passengers were boarded, our live tv and xm were turned on and the pizza was served by ALL the crew, not just the flight attendants. The Captain, FO and other airport crewmembers went above and beyond. Granted I may be a little biased, but I was glad to be here last night. The feeling of seeing that plane take off and those people get to where they are going, even if they were late was pretty darn good.

Of course, the question every entrepreneur asks is not how do I get a Zune, but, ""How do we get an article like that one?""
The problem with most PR strategies is that they are actually publicity strategies, and the number of really good publicity spots available is tiny. And companies like Microsoft get a big share of them, because they’re not reserved for the good, they are reserved for the big. The Zune was panned by theTimesand many other reviewers just last week, and yet here’s a piece that’s practically written by their PR firm. What’s up with that?
The answer is surprisingly transparent. The Times considers this news, news worthy of two photos and a front of the biz section placement because, ""…after committing hundreds of millions of dollars, Microsoft is scheduled to release that device, Zune.""
In other words, if you spend 9 figures on a tech device or a movie, you can count on publicity like this.

The quick background is thatchicken and eggis a cliche for a (false) conundrum: which came first? [it’s false because the egg came first… the only thing a chicken can come out of is a chicken egg, while something that’s not quite a chicken yet could lay a real chicken egg… sorry to digress].

There are countless innovations that would make our world a better place (and would make you a wealthy marketer). The problem with almost all of them is that getting from here to there is almost impossible. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try, but it does mean you should count on failing. Sure, every once in a while an eBay happens. But for every business that solves the chicken/egg problem, there are thousands that fail (insert dead chicken/broken egg joke here).
In almost every case I can think of, the problem isn’t solved by fixing a big industry. It’s just too hard to get all the big players to change at once.

Full,"I’ve been thinking about frequency.I’ve been thinking about frequency.I’ve been thinking about frequency.
Clearly, you didn’t need the repetition in order to get the point of that first sentence. In fact, the repetition probably made it less likely you read it.
So why does frequency work so well in marketing? Why did candidates spend more than two billion dollars on the last election… that’s about $10 a voter. Clearly, the information could have been transmitted a lot more cheaply than that.
It starts with the fact that ten percent (!) of voters polled acknowledged that they decided who to vote for on the day they voted. Wow. Why wait that long? Surely the voter had some sort of inkling long before that.
I think people are full. They have too much to do, too much on their plates, no room for new ideas, new tasks and new challenges (or at least they think they’re full). So when all those ads are hurled at them, they ignore them. They ignore them because they can, and because they don’t perceive that they have a problem that the ad will help them solve.
And then suddenly, election day arrives (or you run out of flour or need to hire a consultant or fly on a plane to Singapore or whatever). And now you have a problem. You don’t know how to choose. So you let some ideas in. You’re momentarily unfull, and then, when you’re full again, you go back to ignoring the world.
But who do you let in? Which ideas get a shot?
You’ve probably guessed already. It’s the ideas that were in line, patiently waiting. The ideas that earned their place in line because of those ads you say you ignored. You don’t consciously remember them, of course, but they were there all along, laying the groundwork, just waiting until you were unfull.
So, all marketing analyses that ignore time are wrong. There’s a big difference between a message that arrives when I’m full and when I’m unfull. And there is a big difference between a first impression and tenth one. Even if I can’t remember the first nine.","November 8, 2006","frequency, marketing, decision-making"

Warez,"A few more riffs on trademarks:
a. a word in a foreign language makes a poor trademark in terms of defense (seeHalushka noodle). So do superlatives. Ridiculous attempts totrademark ordinary language, as Uri points us to, are silly as well. The best trademarks have nothing at all to do with what you’re attempting to describe.
b. a neologism (a brand-new word that describes something that always needed a word to describe it) is a great trademark, in the short run anyway, and it comes with a lot of google juice. Words like ‘warez’ and ‘ideavirus’ are worth a great deal once they spread. Though you may have trouble defending it later (‘Xerox’).
c. remember, there are no official trademark police. A trademark is a license to sue, not a license to win. It all depends on how you want to spend your time and money.",,"trademarks, neologism, intellectual property"
"Change the brand, change the band","Tomorrow is election day in the USA, andRhode Island’s Lincoln Chafeeis quite likely to lose in his run for the Senate. Not because his constituency doesn’t like him–they do. No, he’s likely to lose because they don’t like his brand. They don’t like the accessories he comes with. They’ve changed their mind, and they don’t understand why he hasn’t. He’s busy running away from something instead of toward it.
Fleetwood Mac (what a segue) was one of the hottest selling blues bands in Europe in the late 1960s. Then they lost their lead guitarist (Peter Green) and wandered aimlessly for more than five years until they added two lead singers and became a very different sounding group. The result was Rumours, one of the best selling albums in the history of music.
The distinction is really interesting (at least to me). If Chafee had swallowed his pride and switched parties (brands), he would have won in a landslide. Same candidate, different trappings. Fleetwood Mac kept the name, changed the sound and reinvented themselves for a different decade.
It’s easy to fall in love with every aspect of your brand and your story, even when your future customers wish you were something else. While it’s often better to ‘stay the course’, it’s never a good idea to do so just because you can’t consider the alternatives.
There’s almost no writing out there about changing your brand. About giving up on some things thatyouthink are important that your constituents hate. Probably because it’s a rare occurence indeed.  A dramatic shift in the way you  tell your story is almost certainly more effective than little changes around the edges.

Godin on Trademark*,"*What every entrepreneur, geek, brand manager and marketer needs to know about trademarks…
If you Google “generic trademarks”, you’ll find a list on Wikipedia that includes, “aspirin, bikini, brassiere, cola, crock pot, dry ice, escalator, granola, heroin, hula hoop, jungle gym, kiwi fruit, pilates exercise system, trampoline, videotape, Webster’s dictionary, yo-yo, and zipper”. Each of these trademarks was worth many millions of dollars, and then, poof, it belonged to everyone.
Some people are worried about this.Jeroensend me a note and asked me to riff about it… it even has a name:genericide.
In 1999, I invented a trademark and wrote abookabout it. Yahoo still owns the trademark in Permission Marketing®, but aquick searchwill show you more than a million matches for the expression. What’s going on?
I had to make a decision. I could have pushed the world to call the ideas I wrote about, “Permission-based Marketing”. Or, I could have been really flexible and encouraged people to call the approach the same thing I did. I figured it was better to be the coiner of a phrase used by millions than to have a little corner of the world all to myself.
And that’s part of the paradox of a trademark.
The purpose of a trademark is to help consumers by allowing them to be certain of the source of a good or service. When you go to the store and buy some Mentos, you know you’re getting real Mentos, the kind that fizz really well with Coke, not some sort of inferior of kind mento with a small ‘m’. The trademark doesn’t just help the Perfetti Van Melle company in Kentucky, it helps you too.
If everyone knows your trademark, it means that your idea has spread. It means that people are interested in what you sell and may very well decide to buy it from you.
In order to make it a trademark, most lawyers agree you need to follow a few superstitions (superstitions because there’s no official manual with definitive answers). The first is that you ought to make it clear to the world that you know it’s a trademark, that it indicates your product comes from a specific source. So, putting ™ after your mark helps… and once per page/interaction is generally considered to be enough. So you don’t have to repeat the ™ over and over and over again in your copy or brochure. It’s tacky.
Adding (c) after your name is just dumb. It doesn’t mean a thing.
You can trademark just about any word or phrase, but that doesn’t mean it will hold up. The best trademarks are ‘fanciful’, words like Yahoo! or Verizon. Next down the list are words that are a bit descriptive, like Whoopie Cushion, Wikipedia or JetBlue. The worst kind of trademark words are descriptive. Yes, you can trademark the brand American Motors, but don’t expect it to be particularly valuable or long-lasting.
Some lawyers will get all excited and encourage (demand!) that you register your trademark. This involves paying a bunch of money, filing a bunch of forms and earning an ® after your name instead of the ™. While the ® does give you some benefits by the time you get to court, it doesn’t actually increase the value of your trademark. And you can wait. So, when you come up with a great name, just ™ it.
One thing that has changed dramatically about trademarks is the world of domains. If you own heroin.com, the brand becoming generic doesn’t hurt you so much, because you’re the only one who gets the traffic from the domain.
But now we get to the juicy part. Let’s say you’ve invented a trademark and you fear it will become generic. What now?
My first advice is not to worry. By the time aspirin became generic, the guys who developed it were super rich. If actively protecting your trademark is going to get in the way of making your idea spread, the choice is obvious–spread the idea.
Every trademark that turns generic does so for the same reason: because it’s the easiest way to describe something. People didn’t say, “That’s a sexy Bikini® brand bathing suit.” Because the idea itself was bigger (or smaller) than a bathing suit, the new thing needed a name. And the name we picked was bikini.
An iPod is an iPod, not an iPod brand mp3 player. This is a long-term problem for Apple, andsuingpeople who use the word ‘pod’ to describe other devices isn’t really going to help them. The challenge they have is that they invented a brand name for an item that needed a word. Of course, it’s not just a problem, it’s a huge advantage.
If you had the chance to work at Apple five years ago, knowing what you know now, what would you do? Pick a name like “The Deluxe Apple Brand MP3 player?” Would you hassle the folks who coined the term “podcast”? Not me. Yes, it’s a great idea to think big, to ensure that you don’t make mistakes early on that haunt you later. But no, I don’t think you should spend a lot of time imagining the bad things that will happen if you succeed and your idea and your name become intertwined.
You canDiggthis articleif you click here. Notice that Digg is a verb, because there’s really no easy way to say, “You can recommend this article in a branded social news service like Digg™ by clicking here.” So Digg gets the power of spreading their idea. Nobody says, “Reddit this article byclicking here.”
[previous paragraph is officially outdated, 2023 reports]
Back to the paradox. Would you rather be Digg or Reddit? Is it better to have Google’s problem (notice I used “Google” as a verb in the second paragraph?) or to be ask.com and never get talked about?
The best thing you can invent, as far as I can tell, is an idea that needs a name. When they invented the Jeep®, there was no such thing as the SUV. The Jeep became the name for that idea. The lawyers at Chrysler worked superhard to keep the brand from becoming generic. When the engineers cooked up the Xerox®, they had the same problem. Now, people are happy to call it a copier.
You can recover from impending genericide. What you can’t recover from is a clumsy name, or hindering your idea so it doesn’t spread or coming up with a slightly better idea for something that already has a quite good enough name and idea.

Average Ads for Average People,"Actually, it should be ""Above Average Ads"".
Robert Dow wonders aboutSpotRunner.The idea is pretty simple. With the explosion of cable and other local media, there is a huge inventory of local ads, which means that they’re cheap. So businesses that might not never have run TV ads (local real estate brokers, or IT geek squads) are buying local TV.
Just because it’s local doesn’t mean it has to be bad.
SpotRunner has a slew of beautifully-filmed innocuous ads on file. Find one, they personalize it at the end and you’re in business. Suddenly, you’ve got tree frogs in your apartment finder ads, while your competition is running homemade stuff.
The good news here is that:a. it becomes astonishingly easy to test local TV. And if you’re local, you should (you must!)b. it raises the game for the quality of media in every market.
The bad news is that these are, by definition, standardized, sort of average ads. Ads that don’t spread, ads that get you part of the way, but not all the way to what a great ad can do.
Houses used to be designed one at a time, by architects. Clothing used to be tailored, one at a time, by tailors. Dinner used to be cooked, one plate at a time, by chefs. Mass markets reject handmade, one-off craftsmanship. It’s inevitable that ads were next.","November 3, 2006","Local advertising, SpotRunner, standardized ads"
Getting from here to there,"So, a few times a day, I hear from a reader who wants my advice on how to be Google. Or Reddit. Or Scoble.

If I could only get to there, people sigh, then everything would be fine.
Check out this chart of the traffic offotolog.com.They’re now 33 in the world. What’s neat is that the progression from one place to another was pretty linear. No miracles, no interventions, no tipping point or inflections.

The mistake bloggers often make (actually, all marketers make sooner or later) is the believe that being popular is its own reward. That once every one does their line dance or visits their restaurant or wears their fashion or reads their blog, then it will be popular for being popular.

Coloring inside the lines,"People who want to do a good job are more likely to follow instructions that they know they can successfully accomplish, while they’ll often ignore the ‘softer’ tasks if they can.
If you’re marketing a product or an idea to a group of people and you juxtapose two ideas–one obvious and simple while the other is challenging and subtle, you can bet the mass of people will grab the first one (if they don’t ignore you altogether).
Example: it’s easy to get people to wake up early on the day after Thanksgiving if you offer them a TV at a discount, the way Wal-Mart does every year. It’s a lot trickier to challenge consumers to figure out which one of the eighteen refrigerators you offer is likely to offer the best price/performance ratio.
The first task requires nothing much but effort and that effort is likely to be rewarded. The second task takes judgment, and the opportunity for failure is much higher.
If you’re a teacher and you give your third graders instructions for an essay, the motivated ones will listen. If you ask them for vivid, creative writing, and also let them know it must be five sentences long, in blue ink and with not one word outside that little red line that marks the margin, guess what sort of work you’ll get back? Writing in your format is easy. Being vivid is hard. It’s easy to focus on the achievable, the measurable and the simple.
I thought of this as I braved the insanity of JFK for a quick JetBlue flight. The instructions to the TSA folks probably fill several looseleaf notebooks, but I imagine that they can be summarized as follows:Volume 1: Identify suspicious people and be on thelookoutfor bad people and new and unimagined threats.Volume 2: Stop anyone with liquid in their bag.
Guess which volume got read?
The guy in front of me got busted (aggressively) for having a 4 ounce can of shaving cream. Isn’t it OBVIOUS that the limit is 3 ounces? I could hear the TSA thinking, What’s going on here!! At the same time that scores of expensive, trained teams of inspectors were focusing on interdicting the forbidden liquids, no one cared very much about ID or travel history or what that item on the x-ray actually was.

When someone who isn’t a real computer user sits down to use one, they stick out their chin.
You’ve seen this when your grandpa does it, or when some celebrity or politician does it at a photo op. Maybeyoudo it.
The Chin is a posture and an attitude.
In my experience, people with the Chin don’t use a computer the way others do. They surf defensively. Not only does getting anything out of the computer take a little longer, but people with the Chin look for less and don’t push as hard in their search for right answers or in their use of the tools available.
While there is a clearly a generational shift going on (watch out, here come a bunch of Chinless kids) it’s also being driven by economics and social status and profession. Fortunately, it doesn’t appear to be permanent.

What waiters can teach marketers,"Waiters (either gender) interact with paying customers in a more freeform way, more often, than most service professionals. Here’s one thing the good ones know:
If a customer tells you something, there’s probably a reason.

Now, while some people like to talk just to hear their own voice, there’s probably a bigger reason the person said, ""with no ice please."" If you’re going to be a great waiter, you realize that every single time a customer says something, you need to listen.

Zlist update,"I’ve been amazed, then delighted and then disturbed by the response to thezlist plexoI posted.
My original intent was to make it easy for people who weren’t on the list to be on the list. I knew after I posted the list I found that I’d hear from a bunch of bloggers asking to be added. Alas, I don’t have the time or the energy (or even the skill) to figure out which ones to add, so I decided to make it an open list.
You may have heard the expression, ""everything in moderation."" I wonder if it needs to be, ""everything needs a moderator.""
The open list doesn’t seem to work in porous, anonymous communities where there is a lot of self-interest involved. The potential for bad actors to spoil it for everyone else is quite large. (The lists that have been posted on other lenses that are focused onegolesstopics are attracting fewer visitors but get more thoughtful votes).
Several bloggers worked hard to game the list I posted, instructing folks to vote other (worthy) blogs down. That’s sad.
Several bloggers added their blogs even though they were clearly irrelevant to the point of the list.
And many bloggers got their feelings hurt because if there’s a list, and you’re competitive, then being near the bottom of the list is a bad thing.
No good deed goes unpunished, I guess.
My intent from the beginning was not to game technorati nor to create a competitive environment for bloggers. It was simple: to provide a platform with traffic that would make it easy for good blogs on marketing and similar topics to get read. I still believe that we need that. I’m hopeful that with a moderator (and some changes to the plexo algorithm, which we’re instituting over the next week or two) we can accomplish that.

A note for John Harrobin,"To: John HarrobinVP Marketing—Verizon WirelessVerizon Communications Inc.140 West StreetNew York,NY 10007
Happy new year, John.
We’ve never met, and getting through to an individual at Verizon is (ironically for a communications company) pretty difficult, so I’m going to post my short note to you here, in the hopes that one or more of my readers can get it to you.
According totoday’s Times, you’re leading efforts at Verizon to get banner ads and other advertisements on cell phone screens. The reason? Because advertisers want to buy those ads.
This is not a good reason. In fact, it’s a bad one.
A typical cell phone user spends more than $2,000 a year on telecommunications, and the number is going up. For a product with a marginal cost of zero, this is an astoundingly high figure. Why would you risk your market share and what little customer satisfaction remains by selling off screen space to advertisers?
Sure, some folks with more time than judgment will click on these ads, and sure, your advertisers will smile, but do you really want to alienate millions of users by giving us something we don’t need and don’t want?
Here are the two questions I hope you’ll ask yourself:a. what does the money we make from this effort do to the long-term profitability of our relationship with customers andb. is this something consumers want? How many calls a day does Verizon get asking for more spam/advertising on their cell phones?
The relentless march of capitalism probably means that this is yet another medium about to go down the tubes in the name of short term profit. I hope not.

How to be a millionaire,"First step, make a million dollars.
Is purple necessary? Shariq wonders why so many big, successful, profitable companies (Dell, Wal-Mart, Accenture) are boring. Doesn’t it contradict so many of the pundits who say we need to be remarkable, small, excellent, etc?
It’s pretty compelling logic–look at superbig, superprofitable companies, do what they do and boom, you’ll be successful.
There are two problems. The first is that they already did what you are setting out to do. So copying them doesn’t give anyone a reason to switch. Filling a filled niche is incredibly difficult and doing it without something to give you a significant edge doesn’t work.
The second problem is that long ago, every one of these companies you’d like to emulatewasremarkable. Dell, for example, wasn’t boring when they invented so many of the tactics that remade the industry. Wal-Mart faced down skeptics for decades.

1. Unless you’re working in a coal mine, an emergency ward, or theirequivalent, spare us the sad stories about your tough job. The biggestrisk most of us face in the course of a day is a paper cut.
4. Although your title may be the same, the job that you were hired todo three years ago is probably not the job you have now. When you arejust coasting and not thinking several steps ahead of yourresponsibilities, you are in dinosaur territory and a meteor is coming.
6. Your technical skills may impress the other geeks, but if you can’tget along with your co-workers, you’re a litigation breeder. Don’t besurprised if management regards you as an expensive risk.
8. Don’t believe what the organization says it does. Its practices areits real policies. Study what is rewarded and what is punished andyou’ll have a better clue as to what’s going on.
10.If you plan on showing them what you’re capable of only after you get promoted, you need to reverse your thinking.","December 20, 2006","Career development, workplace dynamics, professionalism"

Top Two Best Times to Invest in Good Copy,"Time 1: When you’re going to spend more than $100,000 on a newspaper ad, it’s probably worth spending a few hundred bucks to write a good one.

Here comes the Long Tail of Reddit (and Digg…),"It had to happen, and it’s happening all at once.
Several sites (a few links at end of the post) are launching very focused, very verticalDigg-likefeatures. My favorite is probably Squidoo (of course) because we’ve been working on it for a few months and I think you’ll like some of the features.
As you know, making the front page ofRedditis worth three bucketfulls of clicks. The thing is, there’s only one front page. Even as these sites split into multiple front pages (Digg now has seven front pages), there’s never going to be enough front pages to satisfy everyone. The irony is thatChris Anderson(author of theLong Tail) is at Wired, new owner of Reddit…
Digg and Reddit are groundbreaking and they are not going away. The power of the audience they aggregate is huge–putting all those seekers in one place makes it irresistible.
Now, though, instead of aggregating to one much seen page, Squidoo now permits you to build your ownlist(and syndicate it), on whatever topic you can imagine.
Examples I built by using some lists I found around the web:Fred Wilson’s Top 10 Albums of 2006Which Broadway Show?Doc Searls’ Top BlogsSeth Godin’s List of Books About Spreading Ideas
Here are some that are better than mine:
Videogames for toddlers,John Williams soundtracks,sci-fi moviesandessentials.So what’s missing? Stuff that’s focused on current affairs within a field. The best posts on architecture, for example.
Like Digg and Reddit, you can add your own entries to (some of) the lists, and the lists change in real time. You can also syndicate them, posting the sharable ones on your blog or your website.
What this means is that there’s a new group of sites coming along, sites that reward people for being curators.
Addressing one of the issues I had been fretting about, each list has a human editor and each list has a doorman–if the person building a list desires, she can screen what’s posted to maintain list quality.
PlugIMis doing something Reddit-like with news about web marketing.
Stumbleuponjust did it with videos (sort of)

Embracing the naive prospect,"Many businesses cater to individuals and corporations that are making a once in a lifetime purchase. Whether it’s a DJ for your kids sweet 16 or a company that pours tar on the roof of your factory, it’s unlikely you’re an expert when you go to buy the product or service.
So, unlike a purchase from an educated consumer (shoes, for example, or a car or workman’s comp insurance) this purchase has very different rules. Jargon, for one, is missing, so it’s hard to communicate crisply. Education matters, because without the confidence to decide, the prospect will stall, or evade, or just move on. And trust is essential, because there’s so much fear on the line.
I think there are a few valid tactics to consider:
EDUCATE–not a little, but a lot. Run a school. A real honest to goodness school, online or off, by phone or by plane. If it’s important enough to me, I’ll attend.
BE TRANSPARENT–tell me all about your competitors. Sure, I might buy from you if you’re the only one I can think of, but I’m way more likely to buy from you if you have the confidence to give me a list of questions and a list of competitors.
A GUARANTEE might be worth less than you think. It certainly won’t help replace my ruined bar mitzvah!
REALIZE that your reputation might not precede you. In other words, it’s entirely possible that I have no clue who you are or what you’ve done before.
COMMUNITY–put me in a room with ten other people facing the same quandary. As we talk with each other, we’ll gain trust in you.
Most of all, I think it’s essential to acknowledge internally that your job is to turn naive, fearful new prospects into confident spreaders of word of mouth.

The Whole Wheat Test,"It appears that the typical Whole Foods Market employee has a heart.
For a variety of reasons, the company attracts employees who care about what they’re doing. Which makes this test relevant to you (because you care) and poignant, too.
I asked at the Whole Foods bakery for a loaf of ""whole wheat bread"" that looked quite tasty. As the clerk was bagging it, I asked, ""Is it 100% whole wheat?"" It turns out that lots of bread that’s labeled as whole wheat really isn’t. In fact, there’s no regulation on this at all, and you can sell a loaf with just a tablespoon of whole wheat in it as ""whole wheat.""
""Actually, no,"" she responded, putting it back.
Here’s the thing: Virtually everyone who buys whole wheat bread is buying it because they want whole wheat bread, not white bread with some caramel color and a little whole wheat. While it might be legally permissible to sell a pale replacement, it’s certainly not ethical.
I asked the person why she didn’t change the sign. Call it whole wheat blend or something catchy. She explained that she wasn’t allowed to. Yes, they have other loaves thatarewhole wheat, and she sold me one of those.
The question I’d ask you is this: if you worked at the bakery, wouldyouchange the sign? Or direct people to the real whole wheat bread? Or would you follow the company line and deceive your customers?
It comes up more than you would think. I get email from marketers complaining that they are forced to spam people and from retail associates who are upset that they are measured on how many worthless warranties they sell…
Where do you draw the line? How do you decide what’s a sufficient amount of non-transparency and what’s unacceptable?
[Contributed by Doug Sandquist, DDS (ellipses his): there are plenty of buzz words to market… I try and teach my employees, my philosophy that is based on experience and research… Take tooth whitening for example… a laser does nothing to bleach teeth… the bleaching agent bleaches teeth.. the Laser is a marketing tool…  The theory goes that if you light/heat activate the bleaching agent it will work faster.. but all the research shows that it doesn’t matter… the research also shows that tooth whitening at home works as well if not better than the in office ""Laser"" whitening systems… in fact the research shows that it typically takes a patient 2-4 visits(usually a week apart) of Laser visits to equal 4 weeks of at home daily whitening… so the results are the same… here’s the catch… I can charge $360 for a 4 week at home system…. For an in office laser system I have to charge the patient $500 each visit.. which means it could cost $2000. I am happy to the go the in office way if the patient understands all the alternatives.. I expect my employees to understand all the buzz words and understand how our office handles them… My employees need to know the pros and cons of the options….. and I expect them to educate our patients about them too!  If we are not honest about tooth whitening, how are we to be trusted for other larger treatment options?]",,"whole wheat, transparency, ethics"

Of all the direct mail we create at Young Isaac, our own holiday cards are my favorite.
Once again, our holiday checks are in the mail to hundreds of ourfavorite clients and friends. Each check is signed and ready to cash for $8. But there’s work to be done bythe recipient. Each of our friends has to forward the check to afavorite charity. (And some of our friends add their own checks because$8 isn’t much.)
We get three questions every year. Here are the questions and the answers:
Why do you do this?Back in the 1990s, wereceived a lot of holiday cards that said, ""Happy holidays. We donatedto a charity in your name."" We wondered, tactlessly: ""Oh, yeah? Exactlyhowmuch did you donate in our name? Did you spendmoretelling me than you did donating?"" (We’re not proud to have thoughtthis way, but that was the thought.) So we decided to send money ratherthan self-congratulatory cards about some mysterious gift we made.Problem was, we couldn’t afford more than $8 (it was $5 the first year)per person. True, $8 isn’t much, but we send a bushel of these, so itputs a dent in our net revenue.
How many get cashed?In all our years, our record is 53% cashed. That seems sad, because somuch money doesn’t reach a charity. On the other hand, most direct maildoesn’t enjoy even 2% conversion. On the third hand, since we forecastthat half gets trashed, we send out twice as many as we would if 100%were cashed. This year, we’ve tried a few new things to increase theyield. We’re testing an additional envelope to help get the checkforwarded, and we added a list of charities with their addresses on ourwebsite.
What’s been the best story?The firstyear, a young woman called to say thank you: ""It was interesting. Ifirst thought, ‘I like the zoo, so I’ll send it to the zoo.’ Then, Isat back and thought about being a single mother. And I decided to sendit to Planned Parenthood and I added a check for $100. You know, thiswas the first time that I had ever made such a conscious charitabledecision."" It thrilled us to think that our check made this person aphilanthropist.

Brand as mythology,"Just under the wire, L. Frank Baum’s heirs have no copyright protection on The Wizard of Oz. As a result, there are Broadway musicals, concordances, prequels, sequels and more. All of which creates a rich, emotional universe (and makes the copyrighted movie even more valuable).
Most of us remember the mythology stories they taught us in school (Zeus and Thor and the rest of the comic-like heroes.) Myths allow us to project ourselves into their stories, to imagine interactions that never took place, to take what’s important to us and live it out through the myth.
There are dozens, if not hundreds of entertainment mythological brands. James Bond and Barbie, for example.
But it goes far behond that.
There’s clearly a Google mythology and a Starbucks one was well. We feel differently about brands like these than we do about, say Maxwell House or Random House.
Why do Santa and Ronald McDonald have a mythology but not Dave at Wendy’s or the Burger King?
Let’s try the Wikipedia:Myths are narratives about divine or heroic beings, arranged in a coherent system, passed down traditionally, and linked to the spiritual or religious life of a community, endorsed by rulers or priests.
So, if I were trying to invent a mythic brand, I’d want to be sure that there was a story, not just a product or a pile of facts. That story would promise (and deliver) an heroic outcome. And there needs to be growth and mystery as well, so the user can fill in her own blanks. Endorsement by a respected ruler or priest helps as well.
The key word, I think, isspiritual.Mythological brands make a spiritual connection with the user, delivering something that we can’t find on our own… or, at the very least, giving us a slate we can use to write our own spirituality on.
Peopleusea Dell. Theyarean Apple.
This can happen accidentally, but it often occurs on purpose. A brand can be deliberately mythological, created to intentionally deliver the benefits of myth. Casinos in Las Vegas have been trying to do this for decades (and usually failing). But talk to a Vegas cab driver aboutSteve Wynnand you can see that it’s been done at least once.
There’s a mythology about Digg and about Wikipedia, but not about about.com. The mysterious nature of rankings and scores and community ensures that, combined with the fact that the first two have public figures at the helm… heroes.
It’s easy to confuse publicity with mythology, but it doesn’t work that way… there’s no Zune mythology, for example. It’s also easy to assume that mythology will guarantee financial success, but it didn’t work forGeneral Magic, a company which successfully leveraged the heroic reputations of its founders, created a very hot IPO but failed to match the needs of the larger market.
It did, on the other hand, work for Andersen’s, an ice cream stand in Buffalo (!?) that has a line every single day, even in January.

Your name is the simplest, shortest way to be involved. Spammers have figured this out, but it still hasn’t diminished the pleasure people get in hearing their name. I even smile when I get email from someone else named Seth
Infinitely customizable short run printing makes it possible to create color images like this one. No doubt that this tactic, like all others before it, will be abused and eventually lose its luster.

I’d be a lousy pilot,"Sitting behind the pilot on a tiny plane today, I was reminded how important, difficult and tedious this job is.
Pilots have to get it right every time. They have to follow a myriad of procedures. They must be calm and focused and consistent, and yes, boring. No one wants to notice the pilot.
Good pilots probably do very well in job interviews–and not just for pilot jobs. They have many of the traits that hiring managers look for. They follow instructions with an eye on detail. They don’t fail (if they did, they probably wouldn’t beatthe interview). They show up on time.
I’m grateful there are pilots. I’m also glad I’m not one.
Here’s the thing: I think (outside of the airline business, of course) that our need for pilots is diminishing, and rapidly. I think the value add of a person who carefully follows instructions and procedures keeps going down. I think the fact that pilots would do well in a job interview at your organization means your organization probably should change the way interviews get done.

The Tipping Point,"Sanj sends us this quote:
Last weekend our family had a get together for my aunt and uncle’s 40th anniversary. Anyway, I brought my 360 with to play some games with my nephews. Turns out both of my nephews that showed up already had 360s, and one of them even brought theirs with, too. So we went downstairs to hook them up, when my uncle said ""don’t bother, I already got my 360 hooked up to the big screen"". I was floored. My uncle is 62 years old! Just then my other uncle (the 62 year olds brother) said ""What? I didn’t know you had a 360! We could have been playing Gears of War coop!"" Now I couldn’t believe my ears. Just then our family priest showed up at the door, he normally stops by for big events like this. Well, under his arm he had a 360. He had just bought it and didn’t want to leave it out in the cold. All of us who were just talking about 360 were shocked and we all just started laughing, including our priest.
While we were laughing we heard a big sound, like boxes falling over. My aunt had opened a closet where no fewer than two dozen Xbox 360s tumbled out all over the floor. She looked embarrased, then explained she had bought them for all the memebers of her bridge club. They were tired of playing bridge and heard about how you could play Uno online with 360. She was worried my uncle would be mad for spending so much money. Luckily he wasn’t mad at all, he said ‘No way, I love Xbox 360!’. Then we all laughed for a good half hour.
Yeah, I’d say 360 is really picking up some steam.
The 360 buying spree has begun… – Page 3 – Xbox 360 & Xbox Forums.

Whale Season,"The web hates channel conflict.
Actually, it’s consumers who hate it.
Channel conflict is what happens when a producer doesn’t want to favor one retailer over another, or gets stuck because the terms at the effective retail channel conflict with the terms at the channel they would like to have succeed.
Too confusing. Let me try again.
I visited ablogthis morning. There was a clever ad for a new paperback book calledWhale Season. I clicked, intending to buy, partly to support the blog, partly because I needed a trashy book for vacation.
Oh. It’s theRandom Housesite. See, Random House, the publisher, doesn’t want to send me to Amazon, because then all the other bookstores would be angry with them. So they offer to sell me the book at full retail, and I have to pay for shipping and I have to enter all my data. Nope. Bye.
See, it’s the ""nope, bye"" part that producers have to worry about. I have a million ways to spend my time and my money, and Random House’s channel conflict problems are irrelevant to me. So I leave. The ad is wasted. The author is bitter.

Pencil Drop (The end of Digg as we know it?),"So, the latest bit of civil disobedience from the seventh grade is the pencil drop (nothing new). Word goes out that at exactly 2:04, everyone drops their pencil.
Teachers hate this.
Coordination turns random events into noticeable events.
I’m on record as being a huge fan of Reddit and Digg and the other social bookmarking sites. I’m still a big fan. But I wonder about the self-inflicted damage of their success.
Now that they are so powerful (the front page is worth hundreds of thousands of impressions, for free, in one day, among some of the most influential people online) people are starting to notice.
They’re noticing by encouraging their fans to post in a coordinated way.
Sometimes they do this in ways that most of us would consider ethical (hey, pleaseDiggthis post if you think it’s worthwhile) while others are hiring clickfarms in India to do it for them. The leverage is just so great, it’s irresistible (in some categories, just a few hundred Diggs is enough to work your way up to the top).
As this gaming approach catches on, I have no doubt that the social networking sites will do a pretty good job of stopping the spammers. But they can’t (and shouldn’t) stop the semi-organic ones, the good blog posts where the blogger asked for the Digg and made it easy, right?
So the market will adjust and the good will still win.
Except it won’t. It won’t because the truly good, the overlooked, the stuff that is built by someone who doesn’t know how to IM the top Diggers, doesn’t want to pay a bribe or even know how to put in links to the sites–those pages can’t possibly compete with the coordinated pencil drop. So they disappear.
I’m fully expecting that sometime quite soon, the front door won’t be open quite so wide… that it won’t be so easy to get a dubious page into the clickstream.

Really Bad Powerpoint,"I wrote this about four years ago, originally as an ebook. I figured the idea might spread and then the problem would go away–we’d no longer see thousands of hours wasted, every single day, by boring PowerPoint presentations filled with bullets.
Not only has it not gone away, it’s gotten a lot worse. Last week I got a template from a conference organizer. It seems they want every single presenter to not only use bullets for their presentations, but for all of us to use the same format! Shudder.
So, for posterity, and in the vain hope it might work, here we go again:
Really Bad Powerpoint
It doesn’t matter whether you’re trying to champion at a church or a school or a Fortune 100 company, you’re probably going to use PowerPoint.
Powerpoint was developed by engineers as a tool to help them communicate with the marketing department—and vice versa. It’s a remarkable tool because it allows very dense verbal communication. Yes, you could send a memo, but no one reads anymore. As our companies are getting faster and faster, we need a way to communicate ideas from one group to another. Enter Powerpoint.
Powerpoint could be the most powerful tool on your computer. But it’s not. Countless innovations fail because their champions use PowerPoint the way Microsoft wants them to, instead of the right way.
Communication is the transfer of emotion.
Communication is about getting others to adopt your point of view, to help them understand why you’re excited (or sad, or optimistic or whatever else you are.)If all you want to do is create a file of facts and figures, then cancel the meeting and send in a report.
Our brains have two sides. The right side is emotional, musical and moody. The left side is focused on dexterity, facts and hard data. When you show up to give a presentation, people want to use both parts of their brain. So they use the right side to judge the way you talk, the way you dress and your body language. Often, people come to a conclusion about your presentation by the time you’re on the second slide. After that, it’s often too late for your bullet points to do you much good.
You can wreck a communication process with lousy logic or unsupported facts, but you can’t complete it without emotion. Logic is not enough.
Champions must sell—to internal audiences and to the outside world.
If everyone in the room agreed with you, you wouldn’t need to do a presentation, would you? You could save a lot of time by printing out a one-page project report and delivering it to each person. No, the reason we do presentations is to make a point, to sell one or more ideas.
If you believe in your idea, sell it. Make your point as hard as you can and get what you came for. Your audience will thank you for it, because deep down, we all want to be sold.
Four Components To A Great PresentationFirst, make yourself cue cards. Don’t put them on the screen. Put them in your hand. Now, you can use the cue cards you made to make sure you’re saying what you came to say.
Second, make slides that reinforce your words, not repeat them. Create slides that demonstrate, with emotional proof, that what you’re saying is true not just accurate.
Talking about pollution in Houston? Instead of giving me four bullet points of EPA data, why not read me the stats but show me a photo of a bunch of dead birds, some smog and even a diseased lung? This is cheating! It’s unfair! It works.
Third, create a written document. A leave-behind. Put in as many footnotes or details as you like. Then, when you start your presentation, tell the audience that you’re going to give them all the details of your presentation after it’s over, and they don’t have to write down everything you say. Remember, the presentation is to make an emotional sale. The document is the proof that helps the intellectuals in your audience accept the idea that you’ve sold them on emotionally.
IMPORTANT: Don’t hand out the written stuff at the beginning! If you do, people will read the memo while you’re talking and ignore you. Instead, your goal is to get them to sit back, trust you and take in the emotional and intellectual points of your presentation.
Fourth, create a feedback cycle. If your presentation is for a project approval, hand people a project approval form and get them to approve it, so there’s no ambiguity at all about what you’ve all agreed to.
The reason you give a presentation is to make a sale. So make it. Don’t leave without a “yes,” or at the very least, a commitment to a date or to future deliverables.
Bullets Are For the NRAHere are the five rules you need to remember to create amazing Powerpoint presentations:
The home run is easy to describe: You put up a slide. It triggers an emotional reaction in the audience. They sit up and want to know what you’re going to say that fits in with that image. Then, if you do it right, every time they think of what you said, they’ll see the image (and vice versa).1
Sure, this is different from the way everyone else does it. But everyone else is busy defending the status quo (which is easy) and you’re busy championing brave new innovations, which is difficult.","January 29, 2007","PowerPoint, Communication, Presentation Skills"
Painting fakes,"Ed shares this story with us, via a friend of Pablo Picasso.
I was staying with Picasso in his studio. Every day, dealers would come by to authenticate paintings they were trying to sell… they would ask the painter if the painting was real or a fake.
A dealer came by one day, Picasso glanced at it and without hesitating said, ""fake."" Later that day, two more were identified as fakes.
The second day, a different dealer came by. Picasso hardly looked up. ""Fake!"" he bellowed.
After the dealer left, I couldn’t help myself. ""Picasso, why did you say that painting was a fake? I was here, in this studio, last year when I saw you paint it.""
Picasso didn’t hesitate. He turned to me and said, ""I often paint fakes.""","January 27, 2007","Picasso, fakes, authenticity"

Levels of Effort,"Not quite ahierarchy of needs, here’s are four kinds of marketing effort, and they make up a cycle.
No Effort
This is the website that’s not designed or promoted. It’s the non-profit that doesn’t have a development officer or the local stationery store that buys the cheapest sign they can find and it says ""stationary."" This is the hobbyist blog about my ferret or the nervous entrepreneur who spends months designing a business card so she’ll never have to actually go on a sales call. I’m always surprised when I see good work that has no effort put into its marketing, because marketing doesn’t require cash… just belief and effort. And if it’s worth building, it’s probably worth marketing.
This category sort of matches the idea of the child that is too simple to even ask a question.
Right Effort
Here you’ll find a website that is easy to use and builds a permission asset. One that buys AdWords and tests them. You’ll discover a non-profit that has figured out how to write grant proposals that actually get funded. Or a blogger who writes with aplomb and knows how to promote his work.
This is the restaurant with convenient hours or the airline with a frequent flyer program.
Marketers spend much of their time focusing on this sort of effort and how to make it more effective. In fact, it might be your day job.
Too Much Effort
It’s in the eye of the beholder of course, but there are certainly marketers who try too hard. They buttonhole innocent bystanders at trade shows, they have websites filled with popups, popunders, audio riffs and toll free numbers repeated over and over again. They spam people. One reason that many people have dismissed MultiLevel Marketing is because of a bad experience with someone who tried too hard. And we all know about particularly obnoxious non-profits that tried just a little too hard to convert us or raise money.
No (Apparent) Effort
The last level is awfully similar to the first one. That’s the marketer who doesn’tappearto try. The speaker who doesn’t solicit engagements, or the consulting firm that doesn’t have (or need) a salesforce. This is the one that is fascinating and overlooked.
It takes confidence to market with No (Apparent) Effort. It’s a zen thing, and it’s attractive to many people because of the power it projects. We’re drawn to someone who doesn’t try too hard, who is booked enough to not need a booking. When Miles Davis performed with his back to the audience, some people were offended. Others were entranced by his cool.
Graydon Carter just opened arestaurantin New York. No photos of the dining room, not even for the Times. The word PREVIEW on every page of the menu. He’s trying so hard not to try, it shows.
There’s a market distinction here. Some people will buy from a gas station with no marketing because the station is in the right place at the right time. Many people will buy from someone who does marketing the right way and presses the right buttons. And yes, there are a few people who buy things from spam email or from obnoxious websites.
There are many markets, though, where no (apparent) marketing is exactly what the prospect wants. Especially in business to business sales, or in certain media pitches, the less you try, the better you do. As this has become clear, businesses are getting better at marketing without marketing, at trying without (appearing to) try.

The Long Tail Inside,"Jake points us toThe Long Tail: Long Tail PR: how to do publicity without a press release (or the press).
At the same time, Frank wonders if internal training is overrated, and whether all internal focused communication ought to be aimed at prospects and consumers instead.
Both are riffing on the idea that one of the most important assets of a big company is that… it’s big. It has its own long tail inside.
Instead of having one book publicist at a company, someone who does history one day, cooking the next and business the third, Chris Anderson wonders whether allowing people to go deep (and to live in the niches) is more important than having  a ‘publicist’. In other words, the editor who edits books on a topic all day is far more aligned than a general publicist ever could be.
If organizations permit and encourage all their employees to spread out, to speak out, to blog and to join communities about what they care about, surely there will be better alignment than there is when yet another clueless publicity person sends me yet another piece of spam about her company’s (irrelevant) products.
What’s missing from most corporate and non-profit analysis is this:If everyone has a blog, then everyone is a blogger.
Sure that sounds trivial. But then why are organizations acting like there is stillusandthem?",,"Long Tail, Internal Communication, Blogging"
Creativity,"99% of the time, in my experience, the hard part about creativity isn’t coming up with something no one has ever thought of before. The hard part is actually executing the thing you’ve thought of.

High resolution mistakes,"The other day, I burned 602.4 calories during my workout.
Of course, I didn’t really. That’s just what the display said. No one can determine exactly (to the tenth of a calorie) what I burned, certainly not this machine.
But the number is prominent and apparently precise. So it appears to be worth paying attention to.
Like a site’s Alexa rank. Or your son’s high school GPA.
Why do so many successful entrepreneurs go right back to building another company after they’ve sold their previous one? One big reason is how easy it is to read the balance on a bank account. Shouldn’t multimillionaires leave bigger tips at restaurants? It’s all about keeping score.
The danger is when you keep score of the wrong thing because it’s easy or precise.
There are literally millions of bloggers that have become so focused on measurable traffic that they end up posting nonsense designed to do nothing but attract aDigg.Look back at a blog like that a month later and it appears to be a series of gimmicks, all designed to maximize a metric that’s almost totally irrelevant to what the blogger set out to do in the first place.
Here are some common metrics (and the thing that might be the real point):
Sometimes the unmeasurable is a shield, a way to insulate ourselves from the fear of measurement. But to embrace a number just because it appears to be accurate (though not relevant) is just as bad.

Web4,"The web changed my life. I can’t live without wikipedia or Google. But ultimately, I’m disappointed. Almost every day, the web lets me down.
What do web users do for a living? What do we get paid to do that makes it worth giving us a web browser? Me, I make connections. I take disparate ideas and connect them in (hopefully) useful ways. Others do it with people, or cash instead of ideas. But we’re all connectors.
Tim O’Reilly coined the termWeb 2.0.It is a bit controversial, but basically it describes a generation of web pages that go beyond the flat HTML of the original Web. Web 2.0 pages encourage community and user-generated content.
Web 3is the brainchild of Tim Berners-Lee, largely credited for inventing the world wide web in the first place. It’s more commonly called the Semantic Web. The idea is, to quote Lee, ""I have a dream for the Web [in which computers] become capable ofanalyzing all the data on the Web – the content, links, andtransactions between people and computers. A ‘Semantic Web’, whichshould make this possible, has yet to emerge, but when it does, theday-to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy and our daily lives will behandled by machines talking to machines. The ‘intelligent agents’people have touted for ages will finally materialize.""
I’ll get in trouble for this simple shorthand, but it’s data about data. Websites that are smart about what they are and what they contain. But what’s it for? I mean it’s very audacious and powerful, but why? And what drives it to work?
The opportunities of the semantic web are limitless, and I can’t wait. But that’s not Web4. Web4 is what I’m really waiting for. And it’s entirely possible that Web4 will get here before the semantic web even though Web 3 makes it work a lot better.
We start with this:
We need ubiquity to build Web4, because it is about activity, not just data, and most human activity takes place offline.
We need identity to build Web4, because the deliverable is based on who you are and what you do and what you need.
And we need connection to build Web4, because you’re nothing without the rest of us.
Web4 is about making connections, about serendipity and about the network taking initiative.
Some deliberately provocative examples:
I’m typing an email to someone, and we’re brainstorming about doing a business development deal with Apple. A little window pops up and lets me know that David over in our Tucscon office is already having a similar conversation with Apple and perhaps we should coordinate.
I’m booked on a flight from Toledo to Seattle. It’s cancelled. My phone knows that I’m on the flight, knows that it’s cancelled and knows what flights I should consider instead. It uses semantic data but it also has permission to interrupt me and tell me about it. Much more important, it knows what my colleagues are doing in response to this event and tells me. ‘Follow me’ gets a lot easier.
Google watches what I search. It watches what other people like me search. Every day, it shows me things I ought to be searching for that I’m not. And it introduces me to people who are searching for what I’m searching for.
As a project manager, my computer knows my flow chart and dependencies for what we’re working on. And so does the computer of every person on the project, inside my team and out. As soon as something goes wrong (or right) the entire chart updates.
I’m late for a dinner. My GPS phone knows this (because it has my calendar, my location, and the traffic status). So, it tells me, and then it alerts the people who are waiting for me.
I visit a blog for the first time. My browser knows what sort of stories I am interested in and shows me highlights of the new blog based on that history.
I can invest in stocks as part of a team, a team that gains strength as it grows in size.
Here’sRikard’s riffon how the iPhone could be more like Web4.
I’m about to buy something from a vendor (in a store with a smart card or online). At the last minute, Web4 jumps in and asks if I want it cheaper, or if I want it from a vendor with a better reputation. Not based on some gamed system, but based on what a small trusted circle believes.
My PDA knows I’m going to a convention. Based on my email logs, it recommends who I ought to see while I’m there–because my friends have opted in to our network and we’re in sync.
I can fly to the CES for half price, because Web4 finds enough of us that we can charter a flight.
I don’t have to wait for Rickie Lee Jones to come to town. Sonos knows who the Rickie Lee fans are, and makes it easy for us to get together and initiate a concert… we book her, no scalpers necessary.
I don’t get company spam any more (""fill out your TPS reports"") because whenever anyone in my group of extended colleagues highlights a piece of corporate spam, it’s gone for all of us. But wait, it’s also smart enough that when a recipient highlights a mail as worth reading, it goes to the top of my queue. If, over time, the system senses (from how long I read the mail, or that I delete it, or that I don’t take action) that the guy’s recommendations are lame, he loses cred.
Sure, it sounds a bit like LinkedIn. But it’s not. LinkedIn tends to make networks that are sprawling and weak. Web4 is about smaller, far more intense connections with trusted colleagues and their activities. It’s a tribe.
You don’t have to join a tribe. But if you did, would you be more successful?
Unlike Web 3, we don’t need every single page in the world to be ‘compliant.’ What we need is:
This stuff creeps some people out. The thing is, privacy is an illusion. You think you have privacy, but the video surveillance firms and your credit card company disagree. If we’re already on camera, we might as well get some benefits from it. If we choose.
I think it’s fascinating that Web4 is coming from the edges (we see all sorts of tribal activities popping up in blogs, communities, rankings, Digg, etc.) as opposed to from the center. Web 2.0 happened in largely the same way. Even online, big organizations seem to have the most trouble innovating in ways that change the game.","January 19, 2007","Web4, connections, Semantic Web"

The Cycle of Choice,"Most markets are busted open by one successful leader. Burton in snowboards, Henry Ford in cars, the iPod in mp3 players.
It sure seems, for a while, that the leader can do no wrong. Market share is high, the market grows, and then, oof, the leader fades.
It looks a bit like this:The leader attracts newcomers to the market. Both new users and new competitors. The competitors offer new choices, alternative pricing and distribution models and just plain old choice. Unless there is a significant external barrier to change (like the iTunes store or the Windows distribution monopoly), then the leader appears to fade. At one point, there were more than 2,000 car companies in the US.
There are several lessons available for marketers here. First, if you bust open a market, don’t expect to own it forever. Second, if you can, invest heavily in some sort of external effect that creates a natural monopoly and gives people a really good reason to stick (beyond the fact that you’re the leader). And third, if you’re not the leader, realize that: a. you’re not going to replace them and b. being just like them isn’t the way to grow. As a market grows, the ‘scraps’ left over from the leader can add up to a huge piece of market share. And then, over time, a new leader may emerge.",,"Market leadership, competition, consumer choice"

If you’ve been misjudged and mistreated your entire life, of course it has an effect on the way you see the world.
Slavery was the greatest crime of the millenium. Why does it surprise marketers (politicians and otherwise) when so many people have a worldview that has been permanently altered by the legacy of abuse? It’s a worldview that doesn’t ask for charity for the individual, but one that demands respect.

But the selfish value of treating people of all backgrounds in the same way is justpartof the Reverend’s message. The other part, the part that’s easy to forget, is that when confronted with enormity, worldviews change. And if you want to engage with someone, you have no choice but to understand that. You don’t have to experience the emotion in order to be able to respect someone who has.",,"Worldview, Diversity, Empathy"
Inventing a new cell phone,"Steve Jobs got a lot of press for his recent reinvention of the cellphone. The thing about the iPhone is that it doesn’t really re-invent the cellphone. Mostly, it mashes a cellphone together with a few other devices (doesn’t mean I don’t want one).
The thing about the iPhone is that it is designed to better connect users to the network. You can check your voicemail in a random access way, like email, for example. But what it doesn’t do is actually re-invent the very thing that makes cellphones magical: how you connect with other people.
Here’s a few things a reinvented cellphone might be able to do:","January 13, 2007","cellphone, iPhone, connectivity"
The $140 million permission project,"Chris writes in about his work atGlass House Denver.
1.  We placed a site sign at the construction site directing people to a website (not the one that exists now).
2.  At that site, we ran a short slideshow of what I would call benefit pictures – no renderings of a pool, just a guy sitting by a pool.
3.  Once the slideshow ended, we offered people a chance to ""get on the list"" for more information.
4.  When we had permission from these people, we began updating them on our progress once a month, including revealing in more detail each feature of the building.
5.  By the time we began the next step, over 5,000 people (I can’t remember the exact number) had signed up (85% saying they were recommended by a friend.)
6.  About 500 of those people had come by our office and REALLY expressed interest/granted permission.
7.  We had about 45 cocktail parties for those people, about 15 at a time, at a restaurant in our neighborhood.  In essence, we invited them in for drinks.  We brought no collateral.  No models.  Instead, we just spent time with them.  Answered their questions.  Filled them in on the details that mattered to them.
8.  Then we created a private website for those people who had expressed interest answering the most common questions we had heard in our cocktail parties.
9.  From there, using a system that met some pretty stringent real estate law requirements, we offered those people who had expressed the most interest in Glass House an opportunity to purchase.
10.  We’re moving the first people in and are completely bought out – 389 residences before the completion of construction in a market that is decidedly not booming.  (Don’t get me wrong, this was a good building priced well in a great location.  But, our marketing was the x factor in making it work.)

How to get re-elected,"I don’t write often about the marketing of politicians, but it really hit home with me the other night.
Along with 80 other people (about 1% of my town’s population) I attended a zoning hearing in my little town. I was astonished by the way the five trustees, including the mayor, Lee Kinnally, Jr., treated the voters who were there.
The meeting was called for 8. At about 8:10, when the trustees were seated and ready (and the room was packed) the mayor decided to take the trustees and leave the room for a private session on a matter unrelated to the issue at hand. We all sat quietly for more than fifteen minutes. During the entire time, each person was saying to himself, ""I will never ever vote for these rude people ever again.""
During the hearing itself, eye contact was in short supply and at one point, a trustee even berated an applicant. Emotions were running high, voters were paying attention and the politicians completely dropped the ball.
All it would have taken were a few encouraging words and some appropriate body language.
Every day, politicians do mundane things. They sit through hearings or review boring proposals. But here, in front of the voters, voters who cared deeply about a single issue, each politician had a chance to really shine. And they failed. Miserably.
People don’t renew or cancel their cell phone service because of the ads (the ads that might have gotten them to sign up in the first place.) They do it based on the service and the way it makes them feel. And people don’t vote to re-elect a candidate because of her debate performance or speeches.
Voters decide because of the intense emotion they feel during isolated moments. The challenge of being a politician, whether you’re national or in a tiny village, is the same—to exceed expectations in the most intense interactions you have each day.",,"political marketing, voter engagement, re-election strategies"
When you should stop improving,"So, Stan Sigman, the CEO and President of Cingular, is at the top of his game. He makes millions of dollars a year (not counting bonuses), he runs the biggest wireless company in the country and he’s the boss.
If you watch the Applekeynotespeech, though, Stan sure could use some help. He appears at about 1:34 into the presentation. He’s dressed all wrong. Not buttoned down enough to be a CEO, not casual enough for the Valley. And his jacket fits funny. Sort of like he’s at his son-in-law’s second wedding.
Stan gives his talk from 3 x5 index cards, which he holds awkwardly on stage. And he doesn’t really say anything.
One could argue that you can be a great CEO without having a clue how to speak in public. But why not either get better at it or send someone else in your place? If it’s worth doing, it’s worth doing well, and I think the standards for a multimillionaire CEO announcing a major new venture ought to be pretty high.","January 11, 2007","CEO, public speaking, improvement"

There’s never been a marketing problem that turned out just the way the book said it will. That’s what makes it interesting. Sure, there’s a science.

How to be remarkable,"From this week’sGuardian:
1.
Understand the urgency of the situation. Half-measures simply won’t do. The only way to grow is to abandon your strategy of doing what you did yesterday, but better. Commit.
2.
Remarkable doesn’t mean remarkable to you. It means remarkable to me. Am I going to make a remark about it? If not, then you’re average, and average is for losers.
3.
Being noticed is not the same as being remarkable. Running down the street naked will get you noticed, but it won’t accomplish much. It’s easy to pull off a stunt, but not useful.
4.
Extremism in the pursuit of remarkability is no sin. In fact, it’s practically a requirement. People in first place, those considered the best in the world, these are the folks that get what they want. Rock stars have groupies because they’re stars, not because they’re good looking.
5.
Remarkability lies in the edges. The biggest, fastest, slowest, richest, easiest, most difficult. It doesn’t always matter which edge, more that you’re at (or beyond) the edge.
6.
Not everyone appreciates your efforts to be remarkable. In fact, most people don’t. So what? Most people are ostriches, heads in the sand, unable to help you anyway. Your goal isn’t to please everyone. Your goal is to please those that actually speak up, spread the word, buy new things or hire the talented.
7.
If it’s in a manual, if it’s the accepted wisdom, if you can find it in a Dummies book, then guess what? It’s boring, not remarkable. Part of what it takes to do something remarkable is to do something first and best. Roger Bannister was remarkable. The next guy, the guy who broke Bannister’s record wasn’t. He was just faster … but it doesn’t matter.
8.
It’s not really as frightening as it seems. They keep the masses in line by threatening them (us) with all manner of horrible outcomes if we dare to step out of line. But who loses their jobs at the mass layoffs? Who has trouble finding a new gig? Not the remarkable minority, that’s for sure.
9.
If you put it on a T-shirt, would people wear it? No use being remarkable at something that people don’t care about. Not ALL people, mind you, just a few. A few people insanely focused on what you do is far far better than thousands of people who might be mildly interested, right?
10.
What’s fashionable soon becomes unfashionable. While you might be remarkable for a time, if you don’t reinvest and reinvent, you won’t be for long. Instead of resting on your laurels, you must commit to being remarkable again quite soon.",,"remarkable, commitment, uniqueness"
Hard to say goodbye,"Why should leaving a marketer be any harder than joining one?
Justin points us to:Just Cancel the @#%$* Account!.
Surely the CFO will argue that if you can create impediments to quitting your service, short term profits will increase. She might even argue that investing in staff to make it easier to quit is money wasted.
I think the opposite is clearly true.
The number one reason consumers don’t sign up for your free trial is that they don’t believe that it’s really free, and that they are sure that once the trial is over you’ll figure out some way to harrass them, steal from them or otherwise make them sorry they trusted you.
So turn that on its head. Make it easier to quit, not harder. Word will spread. Trials will go up. (Anyone interested in trying something from AOL? I didn’t think so.) And more trials from more trusting people can’t help but lead to more profits. Which will make your CFO happy.",,"consumer trust, marketing strategy, quitting services"
I found the websheet,"In September I wrote about thewebsheet, a tool that would allow me to put live Google and web data into a spreadsheet.
Four months later, the best version I’ve found is righthere.
The web lookup part needs more functions and it needs to be open so others can add to it, but it’s a great start and it’s free. (hint: try ‘insert function’, hit ‘more’ and choose ‘Googlelookup’.) The help screen explains how it works.

The difference between strategy and tactics,"
I got a note from a frustrated marketer yesterday. She wanted to understand how to grow her business. It felt like they were doing everything right. They had a motivated, well-trained salesforce, a great product, a decent website, etc. Everyone was working super hard.
Her question: ""We sell something to manufacturing companies, something that would essentially replace a large part of the plant operations team. Obviously, we can’t sell to them, because they want to get bigger, not smaller. We need to sell to the CEO, but we can’t get his attention because the savings involved aren’t big enough to get his attention. How do we get to the CEO?""
This feels like a tactical problem. It’s not. It’s a strategy question. And the strategy involves the entire business and the products they choose to sell.
Here’s the difference: The right strategy makes any tactic work better. The right strategy puts less pressure on executing your tactics perfectly.
Here’s the obligatory January skiing analogy: Carving your turns better is a tactic. Choosing the right ski area in the first place is a strategy. Everyone skis better in Utah, it turns out.
If you are tired of hammering your head against the wall, if it feels like you never are good enough, or that you’re working way too hard, it doesn’t mean you’re a loser. It means you’ve got the wrong strategy.
It takes real guts to abandon a strategy, especially if you’ve gotten super good at the tactics. That’s precisely the reason that switching strategies is often such a good idea. Because your competition is afraid to.","January 4, 2007","strategy, tactics, marketing"
Do you want to be like Bob?,"I get a lot of mail complaining about various companies and their customer service, and Home Depot accounts for a huge percentage of it. In fact, five times more people complain about Home Depot than any other organization.
Today, Bob Nardelli, their CEO, got fired.
He probably got fired for insulting his investors (his annual meeting will go down inhistory)and for alienating employees and customers. He appeared to go out of his way to annoy customers, especially. There are very few companies that don’t even bother to write back if you write to the CEO.
Here’s the thing. In addition to getting fired, Bob got two hundred and ten million dollars in severance. (Try this: $210,000,000.00)
Amazing. I’d been writing a post over the last few weeks trying to explain why Home Depot had some sort of strategy in carving out this niche for itself, but it sure looks to me as though Bob’s strategy was more about Bob.
My best advice is that if you can get a severance package like that, you should go ahead and get fired. Failing that, though, I’m at a loss to figure out why you would deliberately ruin a pretty decent brand by aggressively annoying all your constituents.","January 3, 2007","Home Depot, Bob Nardelli, customer service"
How many bloggers does it take to screw in a lightbulb?,"[Note: this is part of a webwide series of blog posts about compact fluorescent lightbulbs. January is the darkest month of the year in the Northern Hemisphere (December might be a bit darker, but with all the candles, trees and dropping balls, we work hard to light it up). To fight off the darkness,bloggers everywhereare invited to create a post with their own riff on why CF bulbs are cheaper, better politically, harder to market or just plain cute. Your choice. If you trackback here, I’ll post your link in a future post and/or you can add your link tothis lens, which donates all royalties to Ecotrust].
So, why have only 6% of all US households installed even one CF lightbulb?
It can’t be theeconomics.After all, a typical CF bulb saves the user more than $66 over its lifetime. Count the bulbs in your house, multiply by 66…
It can’t be the environmental impact. CF bulbs actually reduce the amount ofmercuryin the environment, because even though there’s a tiny amount of mercury vapor in each bulb, the amount of coal production they cut down more than makes up for it. Add to that the hundreds of pounds of greenhouse gases they reduce… (if you had to buy and bring home the gases with each purchase, I think it would make a difference in the the relative sales).
And it’s not the geopolitical impact either. If we switched all our bulbs, we could stop importing oil altogether. Without giving up one Hummer.
So, why are people apparently immune to the benefits. I mean, why won’t we eventryone of the bulbs?
Ready?It’s because of everything you’ve already read on this page.
Lightbulbs are often the one and only home improvement most people ever make. Even tenants and college students install lightbulbs. Installing a lightbulb is so simple that it’s even the topic of an entire genre of jokes. (Ten points if you recognized the picture and the joke that goes with it.)
Lightbulbs are simple. Lightbulbs come in simple packaging. They represent a trivial decision. You need a sixty watt bulb, you buy one. Cheap, please.
CF lightbulbs, on the other hand, didn’t used to be cheap (they used to cost $10. Now it’s $2). Far worse than that, they come in horrible packaging, packaging that belies the entire point of the exercise. Installing a CF lightbulb isn’t jokeworthy. It’s harder.
CF lightbulbs have a story problem, plain and simple. They need to stop looking so weird, being so expensive and being so hard to open. Either that, or we could just grow up, suck it up and deal with it. (And they’recheaper(much cheaper) now too.)
If you buy three or four and hate them, well, hey, it’s your choice. But if your office and your home don’t have a bunch yet, it’s a little bit of a bad joke, isn’t it? Sometimes, just because a marketer has a story problem it doesn’t mean it’s worth giving up.",,"compact fluorescent lightbulbs, environmental impact, consumer behavior"

Electable vs. Marketable,"It’s easy to get the two confused, but if you do, you’ll probably regret it.
To bemarketable, you must be remarkable. Marketing isn’t about getting more than 50% market share, it’s about spreading your idea to enough people to be glad you did it… 3% of a market may be more than enough, especially if you have a local business or an expensive service.
The temptation of the marketer is to try to get elected. To be beloved by everyone. As a marketer, you hear from someone who doesn’t love your product and you work to change it. Eventually, that strategy leads to boredom, to sameness and to stagnation.
I know it’s tempting to createelectableproducts, but it never works. All the tried and true warhorse successes (Nike, Starbucks, Apple… the NSA of marketing examples) didn’t accomplish market share until long after they accomplished becoming remarkable. If the founders had set out to get elected, they would have failed in creating much of anything.
Contrast this with the plight of the typical politician. To her, 45% market share is total failure. In my opinion, remarkable politicians (using the word non-judgmentally) like Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, David Duke and John Ashcroft are unelectable.
Not because there aren’t some people who are passionate about them. Obviously, there are people who are quite passionate. And the media loves to feature politicians that generate passion on the cover of magazines. The challenge isn’t coming up with a remarkable story… the challenge for a politician is ensuring that the story is both authentic and appealing enough to spread to the majority.
If I were a marketer, I’d forget about getting elected. I’d ignore the dissidents, even if they are in the majority. You don’t need the most popular blog, the consulting firm with every single company as a client or the flavor of ice cream that almost every single person loves. What you need instead is a passionate minority, a minority so passionate that they spread the word. Jackie and Ben call these people the1%and they exist in just about every community.
If I were a politician (heaven forfend), I’d studiously ignore the 1%. The 1% are the fringe, and they don’t actually want you to get elected. They merely want you to make a point. I’d skip this group and pay attention to the next 3% of the population. These people still have passion but they also understand what it takes to get elected.
So, back to my original point:Who have you offended today?You’re not running for anything exept perhaps Mayor of the Edges.",,"Electable, Marketable, Remarkable"

How to Succeed in Business (to Business),"The secrets might surprise you. The most successful b2b organizations, in my opinion, understand the value of:
We worked very closely with Brian and his team atVigetfor a many months building the initial architecture of Squidoo. There are plenty of shops that can do web programming, plenty that claim they can do UI work and plenty that are even hipper than you. There are very few that manage to pull off the kind of work that Viget does. They were on time, on budget and most important, they didn’t cause anyone to lose sleep.
The very things that I look for as a consumer (surprise, fashion, edginess) were in short supply here. Instead, Viget went out of their way to never overpromise. They pushed the hard decisions early in the process so that the thrashing was early, not late. In fact, the end of the process was the most delightful part. Because they know who they are and are clear about it to themselves and to their clients, the chances of making an honest connection with their clients is much higher than someone who is trying to be all things to all people.
Drew Dusebout, a broker/financial planner I know atUBSis the same way. Drew doesn’t make vague promises about financial returns, and he doesn’t get all excited at the latest gimmick. Instead, he’s honest with himself and his colleagues about the world he works in, and his clients always get exactly what they expect. Sure, this is a more difficult way to grow (at first) because you can’t seduce the people who are the most likely to jump ship. You can’t promise some shortcut that gets you the quick clients. But in the long run, I don’t know of any other way to market a service like his.
Here’s the hard part about this: if you’re very good at what you do, you won’t grow. Becauselotsof people are good at what you do. No one is going to be busy referring you and sending you business just because you’re very good. Sorry.
The only way to consistently grow in B2B is to be better than very good. In fact, it’s to find something that organizations need and be the very best in the world at it. Hopefully, that thing is something that organizations in your sphere are eager to talk about among themselves. If it is, you win. There’s a line at your door for years to come.",,"B2B success, honesty in business, client relationships"
Marketing your job,"I’ve gotten afewlinksfrom marketers who are struggling to find amazing people and working to do it with outbound videos.
This is part of a larger trend, which is realizing that an amazing hire is worth far more than a mediocre one, or even a very good one.
My take?
There’s a difference between being noticed and succeeding.
Sometimes you need to be noticed far and wide in order to succeed. That’s why some TV ads for low-involvement products are noisy or funny or over the top.
Often though, especially for something like a job, I think that sacrificing your message in order to get noticed is a mistake. Making a video that tries to be funny in order to spread doesn’t necessarily get you the right applicants.
Here’s what’s missing from the hiring equation: organizations try to treat jobs like commodities and as a result, often end up treating themselves as commodities. All jobs are the same, our job is a little closer and we pay a little better, call us. Sure, companies all brag about the work environment and benefits and such, but when they come right down to it, they’re not so different.
But what if you were different?
Just as a great product becomesremarkable–not because of the marketing claims, but because it really is worth talking about–a great job can be the same sort of thing. I’d use the video in a different way. Instead of trying to be funny viral, I’d try to be honest viral. Let me really understand who the boss is going to be, what the office is like, what the work is like. Sell the job, not the job opening.
Of course, this isn’t an easy thing to do, but neither is marketing anything else.",,"job marketing, hiring strategy, authentic messaging"

Rotating crops,"Sure, every farmer knows that rotating crops helps the soil recover and increases yield.
What about email farming? I was talking to Josh today about this and it occurred to me that the rules are the same.
If you’re sending emails regularly, don’t send the same thing. Don’t send the same format, don’t send the same offer, don’t ask for the same response. Rotating your offers and your interactions maintains interest, surprise and makes your core offers more appealing.","February 27, 2007","Crop Rotation, Email Marketing, Variety"
Name tags,"I love name tags.
I think doing name tags properly transforms a meeting. Here’s why:a. people don’t really know everyone, even if they think they do.b. if you don’t know someone’s name, you are hesitant to talk to them.c. if you don’t talk to them, you never get to know them and you both lose.d. if you are wearing a name tag, it’s an invitation to start a conversation.
One summer, I led 90 people, some strangers to each other, through a three-day training. Every single person had to wear a hat with his or her name on it until every person in the group knew every other person’s name and could prove it. It took two days. Worth it.
Doing a name tag right isn’t easy. Here are my rules:a. BIG first nameb. positioned in a place where you can see itc. ideally two-sided, on a short lanyard (why on earth would you make a one-sided lanyard tag?)d. a piece of information that is an ice breaker.

The billion-dollar question–Joe Schmo wins,"Does context matter?
If you’re running a pay per click ad designed to support a cost-per-acquisition strategy, (Google AdWords, et.al.) then does it matter where your ad runs?
Remember, the point of the ad is to get someone to click (that’s what you’re charged for…  the click) and then the goal of the site is to convert that click into permission and eventually a customer.
So, does it matter where the ad runs if it works?
Media buyers sure think so. Jason Klein at Special Ops Mediasays,""With Quigo, you know it’s on ESPN.com, not Joe Schmo’s sports blog.""
I can understand why a media buyer would say this. I can understand why Jason Clement at Carat said, ""We had essentially pulled all of those big advertisers off of the ad networks [Google, Yahoo] by the end of the year."" After all, the media buyers need to demonstrate that they are using their hard-earned intuition to actually earn their commissions.
But if I were one of those ‘big advertisers,’ I’d think really hard about whether Jason is doing me a service. The hard work of running contextual ads is testing. Run an ad, test the landing page, see what works. If it works, do it more. If it doesn’t work, do it less.
Sure, you need to start with intuition. But my intuition tells me that Joe Schmo’s sports blog might actually performbetterthan a high-profile site. My intuition tells me that a click process that begins on adigital photo reviewsite is more likely to lead to a purchase than one that begins on afine artwebsite.
In order to make this work, the big ad networks need to tell you where the traffic is coming from and they need to make it easy for you to choose where to run the ads next time so you can repeat and scale the process.
The funny thing is that this context argument was perfected by the big networks when cable TV came along. They used it to justify selling unmeasurable expensive ads on mass market network shows against the competition: unmeasurable ads on more focused cable shows. Then it happened again with banner ads–the big name sites always could charge more than the smaller ones.
This time, though, we’ve got numbers. Let’s use em.",,"pay-per-click, ad performance, contextual advertising"

Starting over with customer service,"I’ve been writing a lot about this topic lately and thinking about it more. I have a radical proposal for you, but it takes a few paragraphs, so I hope you’ll bear with me.
Customer service is broken. Not just because of bad management, though we have plenty of that to go around. Customer service is broken for three reasons:
1. The internet has taught us to demand everything immediately (and perfect).As a result, we expect that every single time we pick up the phone or deal with someone in a retail setting, we’ll be dealing with the Senior Vice President of Customer Satisfaction, the head of accounting and the chief of quality control, all at the same time. We expect instant results and undivided attention.2. The rapid proliferation of choice has taught us to demand that everything should be cheap.As a result, we won’t pay extra for superior service, which means companies need to hire cheap.3. The availability of blogs and other public histories means that it is harder than ever to treat different customers differently.Word gets out.
As a result of these three inexorable trends, companies are on defense. They are forced to add a new layer to their pyramid, and yes, it’s on the bottom. This layer consists of lots and lots of people, the cheapest the company can find. These folks are ill-trained, poorly supported and under lots of pressure. There is a lot of turnover (what a surprise) and most are working with nothing more than a simple manual and a lot of metrics.
No wonder customer service is so bad.
Well, one path is to yell louder at the companies, who will yell louder at their staffs.
Another path is to blow it up and start over.
I think the single factor that is killing this process and that is under the company’s control is this: the desire to perform all customer service in real time.
In fact, most customer service can be done quite well overnight. You don’t like your cell phone bill? (I get a lot of mail about this one). If you knew it was going to be handled properly, you’d have no trouble waiting a few days. Your airline ticket from a trip last week was messed up? Same thing.
Given the choice between amazing, guaranteed service with a one day wait or interminable waits on hold with people who can’t really help you right now… well, the choice is pretty easy.
Imagine what happens when we take advantage of the asynchronous nature of this sort of support.
There’s still a cadre of people answering the phone, but they are trained to do exactly two things. 1. Make it really clear to the caller that there is a problem, that the caller deserves great service and that things will be dealt with, and 2. Get every single relevant piece of information.
This isn’t hard to train for. But yes, it needs and deserves training.
Now, the problem goes into a system (good news on this in a moment). And the problem works its way up the pyramid. Each person who touches it either takes responsibility for solving it thoroughly and completely or passes it up the heirarchy. Any problem not solved within 20 hours goes to some senior level executive who gets it solved or gets fired. (I’m serious).
At the end of the month, there’s an easy trail to follow. You can see who solved how many problems. You can see who is passing the buck when they should be grabbing it. You can identify the delighted customers and what delighted them.
And because it turns out to be far more efficient, it’s actually cheaper. Which means companies can put better staff on the problems and pull even farther ahead of their competition.
As I see it, there are three things that have to happen for this to work.
1. The frontline staff have to be really good at making this program clear and at gathering the data. They ought to offer the caller a realtime option, but only when it’s clear that this offers a significant benefit to the caller.
2. There needs to be cheap and effective software that lets someone start using this without a lot of custom programming. I’ve foundone alternative,(even though they don’t actually market it for this use) and I bet there are others. It really works. It’s not like me to recommend a commercial product specifically like this, but I’m talking about Fogbugz because I think they’ve accidentally revolutionized a huge piece of management. What the software does is allow exactly one person at a time to ‘own’ a piece of a project, a bug, an issue. That person either solves it or pass it off. And the entire process is tracked and timestamped and tickled, so absolutely nothing is permitted to languish.
3. The company can’t use the diminished pressure that asynchronous support delivers as a copout to do less. Instead, they have to use it as an opportunity to be overwhelmingly spectacular. Use the money they save to potlach their customers.

Let them fly with as many friends as they like until they’ve used up 50 seats.

Micro Hysteria,"The other day, I attended a talent show in the Bronx. A friend described it as, ""more show than talent,"" but the spirit and enthusiasm of the performers and the hundreds in the audience was infectious. After two hours, though, everyone was dragging.
Then a dancer came out and the PA started playing a song by Fergie:
Comin’ to me call me Stacy (Hey Stacy)I’m the F to the E, R, G the I the EAnd can’t no other lady put it down like me
The place erupted. Grandmothers were literally dancing in the aisles. It was a perfect example of mass hysteria. The song was popular in that moment for exactly one reason: because it was popular. It gave a diverse audience a chance to share a piece of pop culture. It was safe.
The goal of many marketers is to create a moment like this. To capture the attention of the masses. Alas, not too much room at this table. The real opportunity is this:
To create micro hysteria.
To find pockets of the population that interact with each other and create that sort of experience. Susan Sontag did it (everyone inthatcircle read her latest). Joel Spolsky does it. Too often, marketers have mass envy. Far better to obsess about owning the micro audience, at least for a moment, then to waste your energy trying to be everything to everyone.",,"Micro hysteria, audience engagement, marketing strategy"

The real thing,"A few years ago, I was in France, within an hour’s drive of Lascaux, home of the oldest paintings known to man. These are the famous cave painting that everyone has heard about but few people have actually seen. We didn’t go and I’ve regretted it ever since.
Today I learned that due to the humidity caused by the breathing of tourists, you can’t see the caves anyway. Instead, you are shown a fiberglass replica in the visitor center. I’m told it’s a really good replica.
I feel better now. No way I’d drive three minutes out of my way to see a fiberglass replica.
And yet.
And yet when I go to a live concert, I’m not really hearing acoustic sounds. I’m hearing electronically amplified sounds, even if it’s classical music or a Broadway show. And yet, when I hustle to watch some live event on television, it may not really be live… there’s no way for me to tell, actually.
What’s the point of walking through Lincoln’s birthplace if it’s not exactly as it was—how many floorboards have to be replaced before it’s a replica? Marni Nixon sang the songs in West Side Story, the King and I and My Fair Lady. Was she the star or was it the face on the screen?
This goes beyond authenticity. It’s all about the story we tell ourselves. Hollywood makes it easy to believe that Audrey Hepburn was the star, while the fiberglass diorama in France doesn’t feel right. We want to believe about Washington and the cherry tree and about Lincoln and his never-said-it quote, ""You may fool all the people some of the time; you can even fool someof the people all the time; but you can’t fool all of the people allthe time.""
Consumers are begging to be sold on the authentic. The easiest way to do that, of course, is to be authentic. And yet, ever since they replaced the sugar in Coke with corn syrup, who knows any more… Being inauthentic is tricky, unpredictable and often wrong. But it also works.
The fact is, most of the people want to be fooled, just about all of the time.

The CD player I just tried to use has the same problem… the numbers on the inside of the player are tiny, black on black and unreadable.

"Great writing, unfiltered","Here’s what used to happen: A publisher had a magazine, or a big pile of stamps and a mailing list. She’d hire a copywriter or a stable of them. Sometimes the combination worked out and end up with the New Yorker or LL Bean. But other times (most of the time) it’s just a waste. Either the stuff that goes out is lousy or the great writers don’t get heard. (More than 70,000 books got published in the US last year… how many have you read?)
Blogs change that. Someone like Corey(Shaveblog)has to worry about nothing other than his ability to keep to a regular schedule. But when he writes something like this:
The best part of all this is that you’ll start off with this rig, andthen once you’re up to speed and feeling all modern mannish andwhatnot, you’ll want to hunt the really big game, so you’ll go down allsorts of expensive paths snatching up adjustable DEs, gold-platedvintage Gillettes, scary-sharp extreme-geek blades, gigantic brushes ofexotic bristle with more ludicrous backstory than Anderson Cooper,and when your adrenal gland finally gives out and you reach the end ofwhat’s buyable and eBayable, you’ll realize that you never got a bettershave than you did with your first Merkur HD and your little Vulfixbrush.
…it gets straight to us, unfiltered.
Same thing whenTom Asackertakes on authenticity:
Dove is a Unilever brand.  But guess what?  So is Axe.Uniliver’s Dove celebrates women by encouraging them to take pleasurein their individual beauty.  Unilever’s Axe portrays women as a ditsy,sex crazed collective. Same company.  Two worldviews. Or at least,that’s how they present themselves to us through their marketing.Truth be told, as consumers, we really have no clue.   So pardon thecynicism, but Unilever, therefore, is not being authentic.  But here’sthequestion: Do we care?

The Toxic and the Trivial,"Mostideasspread slowly. They’re like submarines, pushing their way through the muck of inattention and eventually they just fade away.
But some ideas spread like stones skipping across the top of the water. They move through a population in a hurry, touching most people and sometimes leaving a long-lasting memory. My post on Google yesterday generated more email than most posts I do… because it was trivial. It was safe to write in and talk about Google’s lame explanation that the stem was green, or the fact that all you need is ‘l’ove. The best ones were the people who pointed out that they should have saved it for Christmas, because, after all, there’s no L.
That’s the same reason everyone is talking about an astronaut driving cross country wearing diapers. Or why it’s so easy to obsess about the latest gossip.
The toxic stories spread as well. The difference is that in addition to spreading, they leave a mark. It might be the impact a failed shoe bomber has (years later, we still take off our shoes in homage) or an urban legend (there never were razor blades in apples on Halloween) or the damaging impact of one encounter with an abusive relative.
Marketers, understandably, often try to be neither of these. But we compare ourselves to them when we dream up our plans. We want our ideas to spread like wildfire, or to have impact that lasts, but we often forget that different ideas spread differently. A quick look at Digg demonstrates that the easiest way to get Dugg is to have a trivial idea.

Miriam wrote in, taking me to task for calling Dell afailure.I sent her this chart of Dell’s stock price vs. the S&P 500. She told me she was persuaded.
But it got me thinking about what it means to fail.
Dell makes good products. They make a profit. They keep (most of) their promises. Lots of good people work hard every day. Are they failures?
Opportunity cost and prioritization are harsh taskmasters. When you have a lot of resources and assets to put to work, the marketplace expects that you will use them in the best possible way. If you don’t, those resources go somewhere else. So, sure, a SuperBowl ad makes your business go up. But does it go up as much as if you had spent the $2 million inventing a new product instead?
If your blog has 1,000 regular readers, are you a failure if it doesn’t reach 2,000 by next month?
This is where the tyranny comes in.
If you make all your decisions based on opportunity cost and the fear of failure, you’re almost certain to fail. Safe really is risky. The Zune is the classic example of this approach. Protecting against downside and being conservative in the face of a priority list means that you’ll choose the obvious and the predictable instead of the subtle or the remarkable. And your competition, especially those that perceive that they have nothing to lose, will surprise you every time.
The laws of the market haven’t been repealed. What has changed (due to ease of market entry, low cost of technology and manufacture and the high value of fast-moving ideas) is that the way you must capitalize on opportunity has changed.

The frontrunner paradox,"The media can’t handle too much choice. And the media is us.
Ten people running for President? No way. We need to pick two, they say. So someone is anointed the front runner, someone else the challenger and everyone else is a dwarf. And sometimes it appears that these decisions are self-fulfilling prophecies.
Individuals, pundits, consumers, organizations, partners and reporters all need front runners. Starbucks and Nike and the iPod, it was decided, were king of the hill, and so it became so.
Here’s the irony: more often than not, the front runner loses. Windows and GM and Dell…
The front runner loses elections and market fights and even the race for homecoming queen because being the front runner changes the way one behaves. It diminishes the appetite for change and for risk. As a result, as markets (or electorates) change, it gets more and more difficult to stay in front.
The best combination is a front runner who is certain, deep down, that he’s losing, and acts accordingly. The second-best combination is to be ignored by those in search of a front runner as you quietly and aggressively take the risks a front runner would never take.","February 12, 2007","frontrunner, media, risk"
Sheepwalking,"I define “sheepwalking” as the outcome of hiring people who have been raised to be obedient and giving them a braindead job and enough fear to keep them in line.
You’ve probably encountered someone who is sheepwalking.
The TSA ‘screener’ who forces a mom to drink from a bottle of breast milk because any other action is not in the manual. A ‘customer service’ rep who will happily reread a company policy six or seven times but never stop to actually consider what the policy means. A marketing executive who buys millions of dollars of TV time even though she knows it’s not working–she does it because her boss told her to.
It’s ironic but not surprising that in our age of increased reliance on new ideas, rapid change and innovation, sheepwalking is actually on the rise. That’s because we can no longer rely on machines to do the brain-dead stuff.
We’ve mechanized what we could mechanize. What’s left is to cost-reduce the manual labor that must be done by a human. So we write manuals and race to the bottom in our search for the cheapest possible labor. And it’s not surprising that when we go to hire that labor, we search for people who have already been trained to be sheepish.
Training a student to be sheepish is a lot easier than the alternative. Teaching to the test, ensuring compliant behavior and using fear as a motivator are the easiest and fastest ways to get a kid through school. So why does it surprise us that we graduate so many sheep?
And graduate school? Since the stakes are higher (opportunity cost, tuition and the job market), students fall back on what they’ve been taught. To be sheep. Well-educated, of course, but compliant nonetheless.
And many organizations go out of their way to hire people that color inside the lines, that demonstrate consistency and compliance. And then they give these people jobs where they are managed via fear. Which leads to sheepwalking. (“I might get fired!”)
The fault doesn’t lie with the employee, at least not at first. And of course, the pain is often shouldered by both the employee and thecustomer.
Is it less efficient to pursue the alternative? What happens when you build an organization like Goretex or the Acumen Fund? At first, it seems crazy. There’s too much overhead, too many cats to herd, too little predictability and way too much noise. Then, over and over, we see something happen. When you hire amazing people and give them freedom, they do amazing stuff.
And the sheepwalkers and their bosses just watch and shake their heads,certain that this is just an exception, and that it is way too riskyfor their industry or their customer base.
I was at a Google conference last month, and I spent some time in a room filled with (pretty newly minted) Google salesreps. I talked to a few of them for a while about the state of the industry. And it broke my heart to discover that they were sheepwalking.
Just like the receptionist at a company I visited a week later. She acknowledged that the front office is very slow, and that she just sits there, reading romance novels and waiting. And she’s been doing it for two years.
Just like the MBA student I met yesterday who is taking a job at a major packaged goods company… because they offered her a great salary and promised her a well-known brand. She’s going to stay, “for just ten years, then have a baby and leave and start my own gig…” She’ll get really good at running coupons in the Sunday paper, but not particularly good at solving new problems.
What a waste.
Step one is to give the problem a name. Done. Step two is for anyone who sees themself in this mirror to realize that you can always stop. You can always claim the career you deserve merely by refusing to walk down the same path as everyone else just because everyone else is already doing it.
The biggest step, though, comes from anyone who teaches or hires. And that’s to embrace non-sheep behavior, to reward it and cherish it. As we’ve seen just about everywhere there’s been growth lately, that’s where the good stuff happens.
[I just reread this, and I’m betting some people will think I’m being way too harsh. That depends. It depends on whether you believe that people have a considerable amount of innate potential, that work is too time-consuming to be dull and that organizations need passion (from employees and from customers) if they want to grow. If you believe that the relationship between marketers and the people they touch is important enough to invest in.  I think if you believe all that, if you believe in yourself and your co-workers, then this isn’t nearly harsh enough. We need to hurry. We need to wake up.]","February 10, 2007","sheepwalking, compliance, innovation"

This is partially my fault because the creative commons license I chose for the copyright doesn’t preclude something like this. However, trademark law is really clear and there’s no doubt in my mind that selling this as a new book with my name on it is not kosher.

This isn’t a new Seth Godin book. There, now you know.
So, save your money. Tell your friends. If you did buy the book, please feel free to return it. I apologize for the inconvenience.
[UPDATE: First, I want to clarify the above… I thought I was clear, but trackbacks seem to indicate that I wasn’t. I fully realize that the Creative Commons license I chose permits someone to sell the ebook or even turn it into a book. I had no problem with that. My concern was that the book was being passed off as something new. That my trademark (and your expectations) were violated when Amazon sent out an email indicating that in 2007 I had a new book come out on this topic.
