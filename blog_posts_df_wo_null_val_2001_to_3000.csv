“You Don’t Have a Choice”,"I am starting to make progress in trying to figure out why people are so upset about the state of customer service today. Here’s a big piece:
Some organizations are trying to profit from a monopolistic/1984 attitude.
For example, when working your way through airport security, the TSA people don’t want to negotiate with you. They don’t want to discuss the absurdity of requiring a ziploc bag to hold just one item–they just want you to throw it away. That’s a key part of law enforcement. The enforcement part.
Well, if it works for irrational government agencies, it can also work for cell phone companies and other near monopolies. It makes it a lot cheaper and a lot quicker to keep people in line.
And consumers, being spoiled, hate this.
It’s exacerbated by an interesting twist: many of these organizations pretend that they’re not really acting this way. They don’t say, ""Yes, ma’am, I know you’re upset, but you have no choice. If you want to get on this plane, you must throw that out, even though there’s no reason. Tough."" Instead, they try to reason with the customer and pretend that they realize we have a lot of choices and that they’re grateful for our business. Of course, the person you’re dealing with isn’t actually grateful. In fact, if you went away, it would make her day a lot better.
Three cheers for the organization that says, ""In order to keep prices low and traffic moving, we’re unable to discuss our policies with you. We’re very sorry if this inconveniences you."" It’s far better than the charade that so many large companies go through. It saves the expedient from having an argument and gives those that can’t stand this approach fair warning to look for an alternative.","February 8, 2007","customer service, monopolies, consumer frustration"
The five minute dissertation,"Treb points us to thisshort video on digital textfrom a professor in Kansas.
Publish or perish indeed. Now that the publishing part is free and without friction, and now that a professor can boil down complex topics to vivid videos, why aren’t tens of thousands of professors scrambling to do this?
Half a million people seem to agree with me. How many people would have read his book?",,"dissertation, digital text, publishing"
Why you need to worry about coincidence,"Coincidence: I’m flying to Miami last week. Sort of weird guy sits next to me. We don’t talk much, but I notice him. We land. I go to my hotel, have an hour to spare before my speech, go to the gym to work out.He walks in.
Coincidence: Last night, I’m flipping through a really old reference book from when I used to write trivia questions. Spend five minutes reading the entry onGary Glitterwho I confess I had never heard of.Today,on the radio, I hear he’s being reprieved and let out of a Vietnamese jail early.
Coincidence: I’ve had my cell phone for two years. I have never once received a text message. Two weeks ago, I sign up for Facebook (long story) and need to confirm my ID by using my cell phone and a text message. In the last 10 days, I’ve received more than ten text messages, all commercial.
Reason 1 you need to worry about coincidence: human beings want explanations, even for totally random events. So they make up stories. If those stories are about you (I have no proof that Facebook is selling my number) then you have to live with that.
Reason 2: if you can cause coincidences to happen, people are going to talk about you. And that might be a good thing.","February 7, 2007","Coincidence, Explanations, Perception"

"Apologies, ranked","Yehudashares this list with us:
There are many incorrect ways to formulate an apology, but only a few correct ones.
On a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is best:","February 6, 2007","apology, ranking, formulation"
Meaningless to two decimal places,"The Compete Attention 200™is a ranking of 200 sites based on time spent. UPS, for example, ranks way higher than Fedex, and MySpace is number one.
This is justsilly.
Any website that attempts to improve time spent on every page (or pageviews for that matter) is just wasting time. What matters is intent. Permission. Action. Retention. Likelihood that ideas get spread. Clickthroughs.
Just because we can measure it doesn’t mean it’s important. Anyone want to buy stock in the globe.com?",,"website analytics, user engagement, measurement limitations"
Measuring stiffness,"Young’s modulusis a measurement of stiffness. I’m pretty sure they mean the stiffness of various materials, like steel or wool, but wouldn’t it be great if we could apply this measurement to people and their organizations?
Some industries have a very high modulus. They resist new ideas and go so far as to expunge new thinkers from their midst. Others have a low modulus, they flop from new thing to new thing, never sticking it out long enough to actually get somewhere.
We’ve all been on sales calls where the very presence of a conference room and a salesperson means that the prospect’s Young’s modulus has been dramatically raised. Just walking into the room increases her stiffness.
Stiffness, as any willow tree can tell you, is not always a good thing. Excessive stiffness can lead to brittleness, to missing the boat because you’re just plain stubborn. At the other extreme, those with way too low a modulus just end up doing whatever the group is into in this minute.
What can you do with this useful measurement? I think the marketing approach you take has to reflect the modulus of the person you’re marketing to. Selling a new pop record takes a lot less persistence than getting a Fortune 500 company to change its insurance carrier.
More interesting, though, is the internal opportunity. If the organization you work for is too stiff, you can change it. First, by talking about it. By measuring it. By pointing out how long it takes you to adopt a new technology, or how many sales calls it takes for you to adopt something great. After a while, the people with good ideas get the message and they stop showing up.",,"Young's modulus, organizational stiffness, change management"
“Sorry”,"So, in the NFL, if the coach thinks the ref made a bad call, he can take a risk. He bets a time out and the refs review the tape. If the call was correct, the coach loses the time out. If the call was wrong, he gets it fixed.
You know what’s wrong with this system? The referees never apologize. They don’t say, ""Upon reviewing the tape, we realized that we made a bad call. We’re really sorry."" In fact, in addition to saying they’re sorry, they ought to give the coach a bonus time out as a way of rewarding him for his troubles.
If it’s hard to say you’re sorry when it’s your fault and when there is no money at stake, imagine how hard it is to say you’re sorry when neither is true.
And yet, if reading the constant stream ofhorriblecustomerservicestoriesthat cross my desk every day, that’s all anyone wants. A bonus time out, an apology and making it right. It is certainly, without any question at all, the cheapest marketing technique available today. Not to mention one that feels good in the long run. I wrote about this a bit inSeptember,but it’s worth a refocus here.
But is an apology sincere?
Well, I can’t imagine how the following sentence could be false if uttered by anyone with a conscience, ""I’m really sorry about the way you feel. We work really hard and do our best to avoid problems like this, but it’s obvious you feel mistreated and I want to fix it. I’m really sorry about all this.""
It’s cheap, it works, and it’s the right thing. So why not do it?*
Ego, power and fear. Three lousy reasons. Time to get over it, come clean and grow.

Gil lost his cell phone,"I lose mine all the time. You probably do too.
So here’s my idea. And I don’t even want to wait to patent it and license it… you should just build it.
It’s two credit card sized devices. One goes in my wallet. The other is taped to the back of my phone (or ipod).

Understanding the Super Bowl,"It’s hard to remember back 23 years ago, but back then, when dinosaurs walked the earth, a few things were true:
1. commercials were commercials–they sold stuff2. content was content–it wasn’t filled with commercials (check out thistennistournament via Patricia: not a billboard in sight).
TheApplead changed everything. It was now commercial as content, commercial as event. The Apple ad was seen by more peopleafterthe game via free media than saw it during the game itself.
So, as you waste an evening watching television, understand that the media game you’re watching (as opposed to the football game) is not about selling anything per se. Instead, it’s about creating a short little movie that spreads. Yes, it’s permission marketing. Permission marketing because viewers are asking for the ads, they want the ads, they look forward to them. BUT, we’re not watching them because we want to buy or even to learn (the way, say, Google ads work). We’re watching because we want to be in on the joke, to have something to share. It’s big enough that there areentire web pagesabout the commercials. I’ll be contributing to the one atAdweek,at least until I get too bored with the game…
The commercial aspect of this is fascinating as well. Who wins? Probably not the shareholders. Someone at Frito Lay told me that they can prove that enough people buy chips during halftime (they leave their house and race out to the store) that the ads pay for themselves. But insurance?
The winners, I think, are the agencies and the pundits and those that would like advertising to be more than it actually is.","February 4, 2007","Super Bowl, commercials, permission marketing"
Cynical,"Lots of mail about the Aqua Teen guerrilla marketing Boston thing.
More than ten years ago, I co-wrote four of theGuerrilla Marketingbooks. At the time, Jay Levinson and I were focused at helping small businesses break out of the helpless rut of leaving advertising to the big guys. There were plenty of niches where smaller organizations could really thrive without becoming pariahs in their community.
It hasn’t taken long for the game to be totally rebuilt.
In the face of high ad rates and stunningly low effectiveness, many advertisers are getting selfish and angry. Rather than investing the money they would have spent on ads into products and services, they’re just running more invasive ads. Even in this picture of one of the Aqua Teen guerrillas we see a logo and an ad… in fact, it’s almost impossible to go anywhere or do anything without seeing an ad.
Try to imagine a TV executive in 1972 or 1985 explaining that the nationwide rollout of a new TV show would involve battery-operated LiteBrite boxes with an offensive little sprite icon on them… inconceivable. Today, it’s not only not surprising, it’s predictable.
So, what am I cynical about? I’m cynical that anyone is going to be able to do anything to stop it. That any government organization or any group of consumers is going to be effective in stopping the tsunami (and I don’t use the word lightly) of unanticipated, impersonal and irrelevant spam that fills our lives. I have no idea if Boston should have spent half a million dollars on this problem, or if the population should have freaked out in fear. I do know that whatever they do isn’t going to change the way marketers do (what they erroneously think is) their jobs. There’s just too much money on the table.
My hopeful side says that marketers should start taking responsibility for what we do, and start marketing to people the way we’d like to be marketed to. The cynical side of me realizes that this isn’t bloody likely.
The only thing that will make it go away is when it ceases to work.","February 2, 2007","Guerrilla marketing, Cynicism, Advertising"
Setting expectations,"Robinshares this story:
In January I took my Subaru Outback to the dealer for an oil change, new battery etc.  The last time I took it in I picked up a freshly washed car, it was a new free service they offered.
Cool I thought.  But noticed the dashboard was still quite dusty.  OK maybe I’m being petty but if you’re going to go to the trouble of washing the customers car then a 2 second wipe of a dusty dashboard would make the job 100% and not ""half assed"". They also started giving a follow up phone call to make sure customers were happy with the service.
I wondered if they would wash my car this time, I assumed not. Not in January, too cold.  I was right, the car was not washed when I picked it up. I understood.
But the next day I did get the follow up phone call.  I said I was happy with the service, but asked what was included in the ""oil change"".  Did they usually check the other fluids, tires etc.?
Yes, a 30 point inspection was always included, all fluids, tires, lights, everything (more accurately 30 things).  I mentioned that after my ""30 point inspection"" my windshield washer was still bone dry and one front tire was still visibly low.  ""Well I guess we messed up"" was the response ""I’ll have Paul call you back so we can make it right"".
Well that was Monday, today is Friday and I’m still waiting for the call back.
I guess my point is that if they hadn’t washed my car the first time, and hadn’t phoned me to see if I was happy with the service I would have more impressed than I am now.

How to be a great audience,"(and what’s in it for you…)
I participated in an interesting experiment today. I was lucky enough to attend career day with 75 eighth graders. Divided into five groups, I got to see a group at a time for about fifteen minutes each.
Within three seconds of beginning my talk, I could tell.
I could tell who had learned the skill of being in the audience and who hadn’t. And I’m worried that it might be permanent.
The good audiences were all the same. They leaned forward. They made eye contact. They mirrored my energy right back to me. When the talk (five minutes) was over they were filled with questions.
The audience members that hadn’t learned the skill were all different. Some made no eye contact. Some found distractions to keep them busy. Some were focused on filling out the form that proved that they had been paying attention.
What I discovered: that the good audience members got most of my attention. The great audience members got even more… attention plus extra effort. And, despite my best efforts, the non-great audience members just sort of fell off the radar.
This isn’t a post about me and my talk. It’s about the audience members and the choices each make. It’s a choice your employees and your customers make too.
It’s easy to fall into the trap of believing that information is just delivered to you. That rock stars and violinists and speakers and preachers and teachers and tour guides get paid to perform and the product is the product. But it’s not true. Great audiences get more.
Great audiences not only get more energy and more insight and more focused answers to their questions, they also get better jobs and find better relationships. Because the skills and the attitude are exactly the same.
I am too much of an optimist to believe that the lousy audience members in today’s program are stuck that way for life. But I know that the longer they wait, the harder it is going to be to change.
The next time someone says, ""any questions,"" ask one. Just ask.
The next time you see a play that is truly outstanding, lead the standing ovation at the end.
The next time you have an itch to send an email to a political blogger or post a comment or do a trackback, do it. Make it a habit.","March 30, 2007","audience engagement, active listening, participation"

The Joy/cash curve,"I think there’s a major opportunity here. It seems that for many products, the more you pay, the less fun the buying is. (Not the shopping, the buying). It used to be true at the bottom end of the scale too–the less you pay, the less fun.
The excuse at the bottom was, ""hey, you’re not paying a lot, what do you expect?"" But Starbucks and others have shown that it doesn’t have to be that way. But what about the top? Why is a house closing such a horrible affair? Why is paying for your car such torture? (It turns out that many dealerships put you through hoops at the end of your buying process just because that’s when they have the most leverage… they don’t try to sell you rustproofing at the beginning!)
Given the amount of money at stake, I won’t be surprised if organizations start offering a way to make this more pleasant. Example: what if a real estate broker hired a really personable ex-cheerleader/glee club member for $20 an hour to do nothing but sweat the details and be charming the entire time the closing was going on?

You should write an ebook,"I’m serious. Smart people with good ideas worth sharing can get a lot out of this exercise.
It’s technically easy and when it works, your idea will spread far and wide. Even better, the act of writing your idea in a cogent, organized way will make the idea better. You can write an ebook about your travel destination, your consulting philosophy or an amazing job you’d like to fill.
Seven (wait, now it’s 12) years ago, I wrote a book calledUnleashing the Ideavirus. It’s about how ideas spread. In the book, I go on and on about how free ideas spread faster than expensive ones. That’s why radio is so important in making music sell.
Anyway, I brought it to my publisher and said, “I’d like you to publish this, but I want to give it away on the net.” They passed. They used to think I was crazy, but now they were sure of it. So I decided to just give it away. The first few days, the book wasdownloaded3,000 times (note: forgive the layout. It’s not what I would do if I was doing it today). The next day, the number went up. And then up. Soon it was 100,000 and then a million. The best part of all is that I intentionally made the file small enough to email. Even without counting the folks who emailed it hundreds of times to co-workers, it’s easily on more than 2,000,000 computers. I didn’t ask anything in return. No centralized email tool. Here it is. Share it.
A Google search finds more than 200,000 matches for the word ‘ideavirus’, which I made up. Some will ask, “how much money did you make?” And I think a better question is, “how much did it cost you?” How much did it cost you to write the most popular ebook ever and to reach those millions of people and to do a promotion that drove an expensive hardcover to #5 on Amazon and #4 in Japan and led to translation deals in dozens of countries and plenty of speaking gigs?
It cost nothing.
Changethis,which I dreamed up in a moment of weakness a few years ago, is still going strong under better management now. It’s the epicenter of ebook distribution, but there are plenty ofplacesjust dying to host your content. And your blog is the best place to launch your idea.

The Dip Tour,"I’m trying something new this May.
Usually, when authors tour, they trudge from bookstore to bookstore. It’s grinding and a little demeaning (here’s a tip: if you see an author in a bookstore, don’t go near him unless you’re prepared to buy the book (or at least hide it somewhere in the store.)) The whole interaction isn’t very pleasant for the reader either.
Well, I love to do speaking gigs, but rarely get the chance to do events that are open to the public and relatively inexpensive. So I figured I’d combine both.
Here’s the deal. (Details are here). In each city I’m able to get to, if you buy 5 books (in advance), you get to come hear me give a speech for free. OR, if you prefer to think of it differently, if you pay $50 to hear me speak, you get five books for free.
Why five books?So you’ll give four away. That’s why I wrote the book. So you would buy copies and give them away. You register online, you pay in advance, you’re guaranteed a seat and you’re guaranteed your copies, available when you show up. We can’t do refunds, because the books are a pain to move around, so please be sure you can come when you sign up.
Which cities?So far, just Philly.UPDATE: We just addedChicago.More to follow soon, I hope. If you have a very large network or a very large organization in a city in the US (sorry, too much travel to go overseas),drop me a lineif you’d like to discuss running an event in your town.

Promise.] If it works, I’ll tell you. If it doesn’t, I’ll tell you.

Just because they moved the dip…,"…doesn’t mean it’s gone.
The music business used to be simple. You gigged and prayed and waited and hoped that Berry Gordy would give you a contract. Once you had a record label, you were in. The Dip was early and steep.
Now, of course, making a record is trivial. A laptop and some microphones and you’re in. No permission needed.
And making a music video is a lot easier. And who needs MTV if you can get it on YouTube.
Hence the problem. Before, there were thousands of frustrated musicians with no record, no promotion and no Clive Davis. Now, there are thousands of frustrated musicians with a lot more at stake. They’ve got recordings andCDsand videos and MySpace pages but they’re still not successful.
It doesn’t feel fair. It’s not. It’s the Dip.
The Dip is what separates a hit from a non-hit. And the irony is that without the Dip, it would be useless to try to succeed in pop music. Without a chasm that separates the hits from everyone else, the hits aren’t worth anything.

Shortcuts that aren’t so short,"The cab drivers in my little village are an angry and bored lot.
It doesn’t matter where you are going, they’ll find a shortcut. Back roads, vacant lots… they’ll drive two miles out of the way to miss a light.
I thought about this when I read a blog post describing the best way to get the most out of a Squidoo lens. The author said you should make sure that the keywords and title are perfect and limit outbound links so that you can be sure that people will only do what you want them to. Others spend time studying the algorithms of Google and Yahoo to figure out the very best way to jump ahead in the rankings for their blog or corporate site. Is it reciprocal links or careful metatags? What if I create some sort of ring so that the  spider won’t realize the scam?
Hey. It’s not so hard. If you make great stuff, people will find you. If you are transparent and accurate and doing what’s good for the surfer, people will find you. If you regularly demonstrate knowledge of content that’s worth seeking out, people (being selfish) will come, and people (being generous) will tell other people. It turns out that it’s easier and faster to do that than to spend all your time on the shortcuts.

I printed 10,000 copies of the book. I also contacted International Paper to have them print me 10,000 milk cartons. This turned out to be more difficult than I imagined. They print almost all the milk cartons in the United States and weren't particularly motivated by a $2,300 order. I paid in advance, though, and submitted all my materials on time.
The night before the print job went to press, the phone rang. It was my sales rep, informing me that they, ""weren't going to be able to print my job."" Uh oh. The problem? Someone high up had read some of the copy on the carton and didn't like it.
""I didn't realize that International Paper was in the censorship business,"" I said. He replied that they weren't censoring the carton, merely refusing to print it.
The offending paragraph: ""If this were actually milk, it would be pasteurized and homogenized. Pasteurized involves heating it up to kill any new organisms inside, while homogenization involves mixing it to make it all the same. If this sounds like your organization, perhaps you need this book."" They also didn't like the line, ""Please don't drink from the carton!""
Instead of calling the ACLU, I just deleted the paragraph and knew I'd have a story for the ages.
Then,Fast Companywas kind enough to run an excerpt from the book in the magazine. This is an important part of the story, because this is where thepermission marketingpart kicks in. Fast Company's 100,000 loyal readers had already given me permission to talk to them. They were listening. If I were doing this today, I'd use my blog, just like you could use yours…
At the end of the article, it said something like, ""If you want a copy of Seth's new book for free, send $5 to cover shipping and handling and if there's any left, he'll send you one.""
Meanwhile, I had found an epsom salt packaging facility in New Jersey to turn the printed cartons into folded cartons and to stuff the books inside. (Don't try this at home! The factory was a godsend and very hard to find.)
If you sent in your money, we made a mailing label, slapped it on the carton, put on a stamp and mailed it to you. No other packaging. [BONUS! If it's August 23, 2010 and you're reading this, you are eligible to win a free milk carton, I'll mail it to you if you win. Here's theform].
So the carton arrived, and already the mailman is talking about it. The folks in the next cube notice it. Many people opened the carton from the bottom and left the carton on their desk. It led to conversations. Which was the point.
THEN, the last step: On the side of the carton, it gave a web address where you could buy more. But since we sold the first 5,000 in just a week or two, the website only offered one option: if you wanted more, you had to buy a dozen for $60. Why a dozen? So you'd give them away. More conversation.
At the end of the process, I had moved 10,000 books to just the right people, created 10,000 conversations (or more) and broken even. I didn't need anyone's permission (except maybe International Paper) and got exactly one great break (Fast Company, now replaced by blogs).
[My publisher wants me to mention that they were then insightfulenough to buy the hardcover rights and that so far they've sold (if Icount Taiwan) [way] more than a quarter of a million copies.]
I think this process scales (not the milk carton part, the remarkable part) and works for things other than books. There are two steps that are difficult but not impossible. First, build an audience that wants to hear from you. Second, create something they want to talk about and make it easy for them to do so.","March 23, 2007","Purple Cow, promotional strategy, permission marketing"

"Spammers, and proud of it","People in new media often wonder when the giants are going to roll in and just take over everything. After all, with their talent and leverage and money (and more money) they ought to be able to see what’s going on online and just run with it.
No need to worry. Consider the case of Reed Elsevier (no link on purpose). They’re a division of the company that publishes Variety and LexisNexis and Publishers Weekly and various trade shows around the world. And they’re totally clueless. And apparently proud of it.
Over the last few weeks, I’ve received several meails, all the same, all from real people at Reed. They baldly (and boldly) ask me to swap links with them as part of a scheme to move up the Google rankings. Anyone who reads this blog knows that I don’t do that, nor does any reputable blog I know of.
Surprised by their corporate background, I’ve responded to them, twice. And both times, the response has amazed me. Not, ""sorry, we didn’t know,"" but ""If our content can’t be found then it does not matter and there is no point to providing this information to our users (or being in business on the web w/a B2B content site). It is both a benefit and a service to our B2B users to have relevant information be returned in their google, yahoo, etc searches. We would be providing a poor user experience if we ignored search engines since many users start their search in this fashion.""
Worth noting that their site is a disaster of bad organization, big ads and little content. Worth noting that their site has no traffic as far as I can tell.

Welcome to Twitterworld,"I found out yesterday that my friend Elizabeth Edwards might be sick again. In the short time I’ve been able to spend with her, she touched me with her kindness and insight. So, naturally, I was checking the web today to see what was up. Along with millions of other people, I care about her.
For an hour, hundreds of news stories stated (with authority) that John was going to leave the campaign because of Elizabeth’s relapse. And then the campaign announced therealnews. So in the next hour, one by one, all the media which minutes ago had been so certain of the facts turned around and printed new facts. And the thing is, it looks like someone in the Edwards camp changed their mind, when actually, there was exactly one announcement.
In the old asynchronous days, of course, we would have only heard the last story, the real one.
Same thing happens with rats at the KFC or with your brand. When the news cycle is reduced to seconds, rumours become facts even when they’re not true.",,"Twitter, Elizabeth Edwards, news cycle"
Inventory and Risk,"Google made some waves by expanding their PPA program. Here’s the way I think about online ads:
PPA isn’t new of course. Ever since Amazon has had an affiliate program there’s been widespread PPA. Put an Amazon link on your site (there are plenty to the left if you want an example) and if the book gets sold, the site makes money.
There are two forces at work here:riskandinventory.
If you’ve got a ton of unsold inventory, you’re willing to take more risk with your ads. Hey, if no one buys an ad, you’ve wasted that moment, wasted that impression. So you might as well take what you can get.
Google’s network has a ton of inventory. Vast number of page views, perhaps in the bazillions every day. With that much supply, PPV (banner ads) won’t work. I remember when banner ads cost $60 per thousand. Now they’re often down to a penny per thousand. All because they don’t work so well and because the supply is so high.
PPC was a brilliant compromise, because both sides take a risk. The publisher is risking saleable ad space on the hope that the ad will actually lead to a click (and then they get paid). The marketer is risking the fact that many clicks don’t actually turn into something valuable, in which case they pay for clicks that don’t pan out.
PPC rewards publishers that create content that attracts action-oriented readers. PPC rewards marketers that create ads that actually match the content on their landing pages, and rewards marketers that convert surfers with attractive offers of permission.
Of course, this sometimes leads to click fraud, where people click on ads with no intention of taking action. I think click fraud is overrated as a problem, certainly compared with circulation inflation at magazines or bored surfers or couch potatoes.
In a market filled with supply, though, it’s easy for marketers to demand a better deal. So some buy PPA ads. Amazon, for example, has nearly a million affiliates. From a marketer’s point of view, no need to be picky. If someone wants to sign up, let them. There will be no click fraud, of course, because you only pay if someone buys something.
Which leads to the biggest reason that this doesn’t scale. There’s a huge incentive for marketers to cheat. Marketers have an incentive to run PPA ads that don’t work so well… unless they work great. For example, a car dealer should do a PPA ad that pays when a car is sold, not when someone calls the dealership. Why not?
There are very few sites built on Amazon affiliate revenue alone, mostly because the affiliate deals don’t convert often enough to make them worth what’s paid.
Over time, the interests of the publisher and the marketer diverge. And the user, the surfer, the person that all this is directed to, is the ultimate arbiter. If the ads are boring or dishonest or ineffective, we just ignore them. And then everyone loses.
I’m not ‘against’ PPA. Squidoo is filled with affiliate links, after all. I think, though, it’s premature to expect that many ads are going to switch to this model. And I guarantee that the last publishers to switch will be the ones you most want…selected, focused, high-demand media that actually works.
One last thought: Gil is waiting for Google to go Buddhist and offer PPN: Pay per no-action. Breathe in, breathe out.",,"PPA, PPC, click fraud"
What the General knew,"Seymour Hersch quotes the late General John D. Lavelle on Vietnam,
""Hey, either fight it or quit, but let’s not waste all the money and the lives the way we are doing it.""
Stuck in another Dip.","March 22, 2007","Vietnam, General John D. Lavelle, war strategy"
Was Google right to be so sure of themselves?,"Chris Anderson hasvery nice things to sayaboutThe Dip. In his post, he wonders about a quote I related from Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google. Sergey said,
""We knew that Google was going to get better everysingle day as we worked on it, and we knew that sooner or later,everyone was going to try it. So our feeling was that the later youtried it, the better it was for us because we’d made a betterimpression with better technology. So we were never in a big hurry toget you to use it today. Tomorrow would be better.""
In return, Chris says,
The problem withextrapolating marketing lessons from once-in-a-lifetime success storieslike Google and Apple is that most of us aren’t Jobs, Brin or Page, norcan we count on the luck that played a role on all of their successes.Products that market themselves are ideal, of course, but there aren’tmany of them. And even those that are don’t always reveal themselves assuch at the start.
Here’s the thing: When Sergey said this, Google wasn’t legendary and he wasn’t a billionaire. When he said it, Google was just a well-funded startup with a plan. And the plan was to confront the Dip. While other startups were playing it safe, being defensive and watching the cash, Google made a decision: do this to get through the Dip or don’t do it at all.
Ironically, Chris made similar decisions withThe Long Tail.It would have been easy to publish this book as a normal business book. And it would have hit the wall. Chris embraced the Dip that faces every book and acted instead like his book was surely going to be a record-breaking bestseller. His actions made it likely the book would either fail miserably or succeed magnificently.
As a result of Google’s decision, they made counter-intuitive decisions. No ads, for example. No clutter. No popups, no tricky interpretations of privacy policies. Instead, every decision was, ""If this is going to be the one and only choice, the best search engine in the world, what should we do?"" The feeling was, if they built that, the money would take care of itself. And the investors who bought in were in on the game from the start.
Did they get lucky? You bet. Did it seem arrogant? Sure. But my point is that if they hadn’t made those decisions, they would have certainly failed. They would have had no chance to get lucky in the first place if they hadn’t embraced the Dip and organized to get through it. I think if you plan on a once-in-a-lifetime success story, it’s a lot more likely to happen to you.","March 21, 2007","Google, innovation, marketing"

What do I get?,"Most marketing (and most business) is usually like this:
Dothisand getthat.
Figure out what you want, figure out what you need to do to get it, and go do it.
I was thinking about the way my Dad does business the other day. He’s been a successful executive (and then entrepreneur) for more than 50 years. I realized that I can’t remember one time when he didthisto getthat.
When he volunteered to run the United Way or the local theatre, or when he helped a local church raise money for a new building, he didn’t have an ulterior motive. When he negotiated with the UAW to create a different sort of workforce structure for his plant, it wasn’t so he could get more. It was so they could get more. Same thing when he helped dozens of people emigrate from the Soviet Union a few decades ago.
It’s been a consistent approach, and it sure seems to work. Consistent as in all the time, not just when it’s convenient. It works for afactoryin Buffalo but it also seems to work for others… for successful marketers all over the world. Now, more than ever, it’s easier to give even when it seems like you’re not going to get.

Anytime you send someone a note like this, where you basically say, ""we’re not going to help you, go away,"" you’re doing something unnecessary. Don’t tell them to go away, tell them where to go. Worse, if you do it when the person is about to buy something (in this case a help wanted ad) you’re leaving money on the table as well.
Posting a picture for an ad on Craigslist is so common that they’ve got boilerplate for the letters they get asking for help. So why not have a FAQ page for it?

It works.
And that’s where we were until today. The most effective online ad buy is AdSense ,where you bid for traffic and pay by the click. This is permission-based, because your ad shows up next to a Google search or on a relevant page. So the people who are seeing it are the right people. And the click demonstrates that they want to see your page.
The paradox (not necessarily a bad thing) is that the better your ad, the better your offer, the more you pay.
So we invented SquidOffers, which I hope will work for us, and which I fully expect will show up in other places soon. The idea is to combine the voting mechanism of Reddit or Digg or Plexo with the text ad mindset of a Google ad. But instead of an ad, it’s an offer.
Make an offer. Pick a category. Pay a small fee ($100 a month). Then, our users vote on the offers. Get a lot of votes and you rank more highly, which means more clicks. And you don’t pay for the clicks.
Now there’s an incentive to write better and better offers (but they need to be genuine or we boot you). Offer a free sample or a free issue or a consult or an ebook. Be generous. Get permission to follow up.

Choice,"Is George Clooney actually a great actor?Or is he just great at making choices?
In 1789, you had just a few choices. Work for the potter in town, apprentice with your dad, of, if you were really smart, become a clergyman or possibly a teacher. That was it.
Today, not only do you have more choices, the variations in those choices matter more. Obvious choices, like, ""should I quit my job today?"", necessary choices like, ""should I apply for a job at Google or an insurance company?"" and more subtle choices–whether or not to start a blog, for example.
The movie business provides us with a clear window on what happens when people make good choices (and bad ones). Very few people–with the exception of Sean Connery or Daniel Craig–have the option of sticking with one movie forever. Everyone else in the industry makes critical choices on a regular basis. Smart choice makers do far better than those that don’t work at it. I’m willing to guess the value of smart choices is responsible for a 10 to 100 times difference in lifetime earnings in Hollywood.
I think the same is true for a career in programming, marketing or just about anything else. If you’re in the position to start a company, why didn’t you do it a year ago? Why not now? If you’re a programmer, why didn’t you apply to work at YouTube when the getting was good? If you’re a marketer, how are you going to spend your time and your money?

Finding the Dip in the cell phone market,"Tim Cook, Apple COO:
The traditional way that all of us were taught in business school tolook at a market was you look at the products you are selling, you lookat the price bands that are in the market, you think of the price bandthat you product is in and assume you can get a percentage of it, andthat’s how you get this addressable market. That kind of analysisdoesn’t make really great products. The iPod would not have beenbrought to market if we had looked it that way. How many $399 musicplayers were being sold at that time? Today the cell phone industry, alot of people pay $0 for the cell phone. Guess why? That’s what itsworth! If we offer something that has tremendous value that is sort ofthis thing that people didn’t have in their consciousness, it was notimaginable… I think there are a bunch of people that will pay $499 or$599 and our target is clearly to hit 10 million and I would guess someof those people are paying $0 because its worth $0 and willing to pay abit more because its worth more.
Short version: creating the best cell phone in the world required being willing to charge for it. And if you can make a cell phone worth charging for, people will pay it. Apple’s Dip was working their way through a barrier (charging) that no one has felt willing to make such a huge bet on before.",,"cell phone market, Tim Cook, product value"
Thrill seekers,"I now firmly believe that there are two polar opposites at work:Thrill seekers andFear avoiders
Notice that I don’t use the word ‘risk’ to describe either category. More on that soon.
How do we explain the fact that Forbes finds more than 700 billionaires and virtually none are both young and retired? Why keep working?
How do explain why so many organizations get big and then just stop? Stop innovating, stop pushing, stop inventing…
Why are seminars sometimes exciting, bubbling pots of innovation and energy while others are just sort of dronefests?
I think people come to work with one of two attitudes (though there are plenty of people with a blend that’s somewhere in between):
Thrill seekers love growth. They most enjoy a day where they try something that was difficult, or–even better–said to be impossible, and then pull it off. Thrill seekers are great salespeople because they view every encounter as a chance to break some sort of record or have an interaction that is memorable.
Fear avoiders hate change. They want the world to stay just the way it is. They’re happy being mediocre, because being mediocre means less threat/fear/change. They resent being pushed into the unknown, because the unknown is a scary place.
An interesting side discussion: one of the biggest factors in the success of the US isn’t our natural resources or location. It’s that so many people in this country came here seeking a thrill.
So why not call them risk seekers and risk avoiders? Well, it used to be true. Seeking thrillswasrisky. But no longer. Now, of course, safe is risky. The horrible irony is that the fear avoiders are setting themselves up for big changes because they’re confused. The safest thing they can do now, it turns out, is become a thrill seeker.

In areas like IA they want to buy the LD for .05 cents a minute and then charge Qwest as high as .15 cents a minute for terminating the call. They want to buy it for less then it costs.

Lessons from Neil Young,"I’ve been listening toLive at Massey Hall: Neil Youngand thinking and even crying a bit. It’s an awfully powerful piece of work.
Two lessons for marketers, one small, the other bigger. First, it’s interesting to note how much more excited and open the crowd is to songs they’ve heard before. Even some of the songs that ended up becoming classics got a tepid reaction because they were unknown at the time.
Second, on songs that aren’t working so well, you will hear Neil try harder, play louder, raise his voice and strain to make an impact. It doesn’t work. At all. It’s what you say, most of the time, not how you say it.","March 14, 2007","Neil Young, marketing lessons, audience engagement"
Good is not almost as good as great,"I went to trade in mycarJay Porter Prius for an updated Prius today. Well, I meant to do that, but I walked out instead.
I arrive at Westchester Toyota and pass two or three salespeople loitering outside. Inside, there were two or three more, sitting in a line of chairs, waiting for the signal from the headmistress at the counter.
My guess is that even for a thriving brand like Toyota, most of these guys weren’t paid so much. They were ‘good’ salespeople, lifers who showed up, did what they were told and closed a sale here and there.
It soon became clear that the salesperson who was assigned to me wasn’t ‘great’. The dealership had messed up: He had no record of my appointment, no file, no history of why I came. But he just punted. He made no effort to engage with me or look me in the eye or empathize with my frustration at the complete waste of time my call yesterday had been. He gave up after about ten seconds, bummed out that he had lost his place in line. So I left.
Driving home, I started to think about the discontinuity in the graph of salespeople. Discontinuities are interesting, because that’s where you can see how a system works. In this case, it’s obvious that a great salesperson is going to sell far, far more than a good one. Nine women working together can’t have a baby in one  month, and ten good salespeople still aren’t going to close the account that a great one could. That’s because it’s not a linear scale. The great ones reach out. They work the phones when they’re not first in line. They understand what a customer wants. They’re not just better than good. They’re playing a totally different game.
My best advice: Fire half your salesforce. Then, give the remainder, the top people, a big raise, and use the money left over to steal the best salespeole you can find from other industries or even from your competition. You’ll end up with fewer salespeople. But all of them will be great.
And the good guys? Have them go work for the competition.","March 13, 2007","sales, great vs good, leadership"

I’ve been sent a proof copy of a delightfully slim new book by Seth Godin called The Dip – A little book that teaches you when to quit (and when to stick). Godin’s theory is that quitting is a vital part of success. The worst thing any of us can do is to try to be well rounded people: he urges us to concentrate all efforts on the things we are going to win at, and quit everything else.""
So maybe the only delightful part was the width of the book, but it’s better than, say, ""annoying…"" or ""plagiarized…""","March 12, 2007","The Dip, Seth Godin, quitting"
The relentless rush to be mediocre,"That’s what my book is really about. Or, to be a lot more positive about it, it’s about avoiding temptation and gravity and becoming the best in the world.
I’m amazed at how quickly people will stand up and defend not just the status quo but the inevitability of it. We’ve been taught since forever that the world needs joiners and followers, not just leaders. We’ve been taught that fitting in is far better than standing out, and that good enough is good enough.
Which might have been fine in a company town, but doesn’t work so well in a winner-take-all world. Now, the benefits that accrue to someone who is the best in the world are orders of magnitude greater than the crumbs they save for the average. No matter how hard working the average may be.
I’ve never met anyone… anyone… who needed to settle for being average. Best is a slot that’s available to everyone, somewhere.",,"mediocrity, excellence, individuality"
Advice for Nathan (and anyone that wants to be a marketer),"I just got a note from Nathan, who asks,
"" [I recently realized] that I want to be a marketer. So now with a resume that includes ""Research Analyst"" for an economics professor, ""Finance Director"" for a Nevada governor candidate, and a degree in physics from Harvard, I find myself applying for jobs in marketing. Ultimately, I would like to be VP of Product Development or perhaps CEO at a new company (I love bringing remarkable ideas to frutition), and I have suddenly realized marketing, not finance, is the way to go for me. And, as I search for jobs and try to find an entry point for my new found path, I have a few questions:
1. Where do I start? Most of what I read online seems to say I should have had a marketing internship in college. Can get an Assistant Brand Manager position with no experience?
2. Do you have company suggestions? Which companies get that some of the millions they are spending on TV ads could be better spent improving their products/services?
3. Which books should form the backbone of my marketing education?""
My answer is easy to write, harder to implement. In my experience the single best way to become a marketer is to market. And since marketing isn’t expensive any longer (it takes more guts than money), there’s no need to work for Procter & Gamble. None. In the old days, you could argue that you needed to apprentice with an expert and that you needed access to millions (or billions) to spend. No longer.
So, start your own gig. Even if you’re 12 years old, start a store on eBay. You’ll learn just about everything you need to learn about digital marketing by building an electronic storefront, doing permission-based email campaigns, writing a blog, etc. Who knows more about marketing–Scoble or some mid-level marketing guy in Redmond?
You don’t need a lot of time or a lot of money. You can start with six hours every weekend. Over time, if (and when) you get good at it, take on clients. Paying clients. Folks that need brilliant marketers will beat down the door to get at you. After a while, you may decide you like that life. Or, more likely, you’ll decide you’d rather be your own client.
People who want to become great fishermen don’t go to work on a salmon trawler. And people who want to become marketers ought to just start marketing. (Bonus: here is abook list).",,"marketing, career advice, entrepreneurship"

It’s easy to get hung up on whether it’s appropriate to put on a show when it comes to airport security or eating at your restaurant or attending your church. But I think it’s more interesting to get past that discussion and instead wonder, ""If we’re going to put on a show, how could we do it better?""

Security Theatre,"Almost everything that happens before you fly on a plane is not as it seems. In order to deal with anxiety, the airlines put on a show. They’ve been doing it for a long, long time, and it’s starting to show signs of wear and tear. The show is getting old and the lies are starting to show. Here’s some snips from anEconomistarticle (hat tip to theFreaknomicsblog):
“GOOD morning, ladies andgentlemen. We are delighted to welcome you aboard Veritas Airways, theairline that tells it like it is. Please ensure that your seat belt isfastened, your seat back is upright and your tray-table is stowed. AtVeritas Airways, your safety is our first priority. Actually, that isnot quite true: if it were, our seats would be rear-facing, like thosein military aircraft, since they are safer in the event of an emergencylanding. But then hardly anybody would buy our tickets and we would gobust.
…
Your life-jacket can be found under your seat, but please do notremove it now. In fact, do not bother to look for it at all. In theevent of a landing on water, an unprecedented miracle will haveoccurred, because in the history of aviation the number of wide-bodiedaircraft that have made successful landings on water is zero. Thisaircraft is equipped with inflatable slides that detach to form liferafts, not that it makes any difference. Please remove high-heeledshoes before using the slides. We might as well add that space helmetsand anti-gravity belts should also be removed, since even to mentionthe use of the slides as rafts is to enter the realm of science fiction.
Please switch off all mobile phones, since they can interfere withthe aircraft’s navigation systems. At least, that’s what you’ve alwaysbeen told. The real reason to switch them off is because they interferewith mobile networks on the ground, but somehow that doesn’t soundquite so good. On most flights a few mobile phones are left on bymistake, so if they were really dangerous we would not allow them onboard at all, if you think about it…""
The list is endless (plastic forks, etc.) but the lesson is subtle:everybusiness does this. From the standardized layout of a doctor’s waiting room to the forms you fill out at the bank, we subject our clients and prospects to a little show that is not directly related to what we’re doing for them. We’re all doing theatre. We want our waiter to be better dressed than us, and the stockbroker’s office to be as far away from an off track betting facility (or a laundromat) as possible.
Of course, the showisrelated to what we’re selling. It’s related for the same reason that the price of a cup of coffee varies by a factor of 120 depending on who made it and where you consume it. You don’t have to like the fact that a show is going on, but you’re part of it. The most successful organizations understand this and work hard to put on a show that works.

Quote of the day,"""It’s a creative approach, but like any new company, there’s a certain risk. More new companies go under than old companies.""
That’s Michael Kozol, public policy specialist for the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, quoted in the Times.
This so perfectly captures the fear and irrationality of the large organization that it’s hard to keep from typing in all capital letters. Here’s what he forgot to say, ""Actually, every large company goes under… except for the large companies that take risks and reinvent themselves. The rest of us just fade away, sooner rather than later.""
He also forgot to say, ""Actually, the top spots and large investment stakes in big companies are pretty much all taken, so if you weren’t lucky enough to end up on top, (or if you don’t want to spend your career waiting for your boss to die) the only way in the world you’re going to succeed is by doing your own thing, building your own division or starting your own gig… and by teaching the big guys a thing or two.""",,"risk, innovation, entrepreneurship"
Where do you park?,"The manager of the Chase bank in Pleasantville parks right out front. Her branch is on a quiet street with parking meters available for customers to use. Figure there’s perhaps a dozen spaces convenient enough to make it worth going to the bank… if they’re full, keep on driving, because there’s always another bank coming up soon.
And yet, the manager parks right out front (in fact, I saw her move her car from two spaces away to an even closer spot today). She has four or five people working in the branch, so if they follow her lead, that’s half the spaces.
Of course, it’s a far bigger issue than parking spaces. It’s about eating lunch with your employees, handing out free samples to customers instead of your friends or answering the phone yourself when customer service gets backed up.
I’m increasingly coming to the conclusion that there are really only two attitudes that people bring to work with them. Either they park right out front, or they park down the street in order to send a signal to their staff, their customers and themselves.","March 7, 2007","Parking, Leadership, Customer Service"
"Money, popularity, quality","It’s a lesson we all learned in high school, but one that is playing itself out in theart marketas well. Thanks to Steve for the link.
What makes a great work of art? Almost entirely, it’s how much it sells for. An expensive avant garde painting that breaks through a price barrier will define an entirely new school for years to come. We do the same thing with music… if a song takes off, sells lots of copies and makes the musician rich and famous, we assume that there’s some sort of inherent ‘quality’ in what they did, as opposed to deciding that our definition of quality in that field is: what sells.
The critic in me cringes to write this. After all, what makes a great work of art should have nothing at all to do with how much it sells for and everything to do with how it makes you feel. I think the game here is in the definition of ‘great.’ And what society has chosen–for a coffee shop, a song, a poem, a new kind of workman’s comp insurance–is that ‘great’ means successful. Not the other way around.
So the challenges, I guess, are to get good at predicting ‘great’ before the market takes action, and to be clear with yourself and your colleagues about what exactly you’re trying to build.",,"art market, quality, success"
Rule of Thumb…,"The very first book I ever created was a joint venture with Chip Conley. Now it’s a wiki moderated by Ben Casnocha.Business Rules of Thumb – A wiki to add business rules of thumb….
When Chip and wrote the book (twenty years ago this week, I’m guessing), we had two goals: First, to point out that many rules of thumb are dated anachronisms, crutches used by slow-moving people in a fast moving world. Second, to teach newbies what the rules were, because you can’t change things without knowing the status quo.
The base of rules we collected is now woefully out of date at the same time it remains heavily used. Ben is hoping you might want to add some of your own.
[Trivia: Andrew Tobias declined to write the foreword for the book. His reason? Because in my note to him asking him to contribute one, I spelled it ""forward."" Lesson learned. Trivia #2: the book got almost no promotion because the week it came out, Vanna White’s autobiography from the same editor was published. Guess who got Jim’s attention?

They have a big sign up that says I’m to be given a gift card if I have to wait more than ten minutes for my transaction to be completed. The guy waited on me, and a timer started ticking on the TV located over the service desk. He disappeared into the back to pick up my dehumidifier. 9 and a half minutes later the timer stopped. 15 minutes later I was handed my dehumidifier.
I asked this guy about the gift card and he pointed at the TV monitor which still displayed 9:30. I asked to see a manager… [apparently, they figured out how to change the timer so it always stops just before ten minutes].
On the way out I noticed a big sign congratulating the employees for serving all customers in ten minutes or less last month.""

Welcome to The Dip,"I was doing email permission marketing long before Al Gore even had a chance to invent the Internet. In the late 1990s, email was an incredibly powerful tool. In fact, it wasn’t unusual to get a 50% response rate to a well-created piece of mail delivered with permission to the right person at the right time.
Which is why I stopped. Without a large team, I just couldn’t do justice to the responses an email would generate. If 100 or 1,000 people take the time to write to me, I figure I ought to be able to take the time to write back.

It sounds reasonable. It’s not.
The problem with huge markets is the same problem you’d have playing squash or raquetball on a court that’s too big. The ball doesn’t have a wall to bounce off of. Huge horizontal markets have no echo chamber, no niches, no easy entry points. To make a system like this work, everyone has to agree on the technology and then there has to be a huge push to get millions of people to make the same decision at about the same time.

If you want to get off to a great start in the primaries, be Dennis Kucinic or Sam Brownback. Someone the noisy people like to talk about.
If you want traffic to your blog, blog about blogging, because bloggers are noisy.
Noisy: as in being willing to raise your voice in defense (or in opposition) to an idea, a product or a person.
The noisy peopleshun the non-believers. (This video will never be fully scraped off your consciousness after you watch it, I promise). They (okay, we, cause I’m a noisy person too) are drawn to stuff at the edges and we like to talk about it. When I heard two kids at the middle school acting out the non-believers part of the Candy Mountain video, I knew it had arrived.
And I also knew that it was unlikely to go much further. The disappointment of the noisy people is this: Jon Stewart and Peet’s Coffee and the Mac almost never make it across the chasm, almost never become the choice of the masses. The parts of the story that make us delighted to talk about it, the parts of the story that make it easy to spread, rarely work for the masses.
So, if you want to reach the masses, you’ll need to realize that changing your story (but not your essence) is part of the deal. It’ll disappoint your noisy people, no doubt about it. But if you’re authentic in the core of what you offer, they’ll forgive you.

The marketer’s guide to personal finance,"Even in the web 2.0 world, marketers need money. We need money to create remarkable products and to tell stories that spread. We need it to hire the best people and most of all, to stick it out until our ideas spread.
Which is why all but the largest companies need to learn a key lesson of personal finance.
This chart shows what happens to two people. The smart person, we’ll call him Gallant, manages to save $100 a month for five years.
The other one, we’ll call him Doofus, spends $100 more than he has every month.
After five years, Gallant has almost $7,000 in the bank. Even with only 5% interest, he’s building an asset that keeps him out of trouble with his mother-in-law and gives him the freedom to invest in the next part of his business.
The same period of time, Doofus has used his credit cards to finance his debt of $100 a month. That tiny nut has now added up to about $13,000 in 24% credit card debt. And every single month it gets a lot bigger.
If this isn’t interesting to you, consider the company that spends $10,000 or $100,000 extra every month.
A lot of organizations decide to skip the rice and beans and studio apartment step. They decide to ""go big or stay home."" More often than not, they end up going home.
I spent many years window shopping restaurant menus and driving all night to get to meetings where the plane cost just a bit too much. I thought at the time that I had no choice, but now I realize that I could have borrowed money on my credit cards and lived a little easier. I’m glad I didn’t.
When I talk to people who want to become marketers, I almost always tell them to go start something and go market something. The same advice for 15 year olds and seniors. Turning off the TV and building a Cafe Press store is not only free, but it starts to build a professional-skills asset for the long haul. Pay as much as you need to for things that matter, and as little as you can for things that don’t.

Even governments market,"…sometimes, though, they don’t do it very well.
If you want to travel to India, you need a visa. The Indian government would very much like you to travel to their country, to exchange ideas, do business, see the sights and spend some money. But you need a visa first.
I spent a few hours at the Indian consulate in New York Friday. It was filled with so many possibilities, I had trouble remembering them all.
Many of the chairs are broken, leaving sharp steel platforms on which to crouch. And there aren’t enough chairs, broken or not. The signs are confusing, the two clerks are protected by a sheet of glass a full inch thick (which is twice the thickness of a typical bank’s) and the little machine that dispenses deli-style tickets is broken.
Fixing the consulate would be easy. I’d start by putting in phone lines to a call center in India and making it easy for anyone waiting to get questions answered by a helpful person with plenty of time to invest in the conversation. I’d buy some comfortable chairs. I’d invite airlines and hotels to have brochures or even better, a booking agent right there in the waiting area. I’d hire seven more clerks. And I’d definitely lose the glass.
The more important issue is this: this is a business. They take in more than $20,000 a day in fees, but even more important, the way they market themselves has a direct and important impact on travel decisions. No visa, no trip. Big hassle, no trip. Given that every single person traveling to this vast country must deal with the consulate first, think of the leverage… Just a small influence on the quantity or quality of travel to India would be huge.
My takeaway was this: the people in that building were way too nice and way too smart to not know the many ways they could fix this process. The problem is that this bureaucracy, like most bureaucracies, has an attitude ofminimizing,not maximizing. They want to minimize expense, not maximize benefit. There isn’t a single person there who has as part of his job, ""change systems to increase the satisfaction of people we deal with.""

Book tour update: When the funnel gets flipped,"A few weeks ago, I blogged about a new kind of book tour I am planning for May. Little did I know that it would turn into a fascinating experiment in the power of the network.Find out all the details on the entire tour right here.
As of now, the tour is scheduled for about half a dozen cities, including:
Philadelphia, May 16
Chicago, May 22
New York, May 29
Santa Clara, May 23
Ann Arbor, May 22
Phoenix/Tempe, May 24

…with Salt Lake City coming as soon as we nail down the timing.[Breaking news:Salt Lake City, May 24in the afternoon is now ready for booking.] The amazing thing is that most of these were created, built and run by people I have never met before. Satisfied readers decided it would be fun to see if they could organize hundreds of people, find a venue, work with a bookstore and pull the entire thing off. And they have. It’s gratifying and humbling, and a testament to what one person with dedication can do now that we all have access to the network. You can find organizer pages forSalt Lake,Phoenix,Ann ArborandSilicon Valleyfor more details on how they did it.
This is a much bigger story than one author visiting a few cities. This sort of approach works for just about any marketer. If you don’t have customers who are willing to organize this sort of event, what are you missing? It’s easy to imagine doctors doing it when bringing a brain researcher to town. Or chocolate or wine fanatics welcoming a particularly talented vintner to their neighborhood. And it doesn’t have to be an in person visit. It could work just as well in sending people to a vibrant, important YouTube document on a politician, or a blog post about a new actuarial practice.
It’s taking the world (including me) a long time to get around the top-down, Oprah-driven mindset that comes so naturally.
Almost all authors hate book tours. They hate the idea of going to a city on spec, hoping the bookstore can scare enough people into coming by (usually by posting signs in the lobby) and most of all they hate the idea of a slightly indifferent audience walking by, sniffing at a book and walking away. Ouch. And it’s not just authors that hate it. Willy Loman hated it, too. So does John McCain.
The takeaway for all of us is this:1. Build a permission asset: a group of people that actually wants to hear what you’re up to.2. Create something (a product, a service, a story) that those people want to spread (not get paid to spread, but choose to spread) and get out of the way.

The real 80/20 rule,"We’ve all heard variations on Pareto’s law. 80% of your business comes from 20% of your customers. You get 80% of your media awareness from 20% of your buy. 80% of your grades come from 20% of the effort. Or, as Woody Allen would say, 80% of success is just showing up.
The Dip turns this thinking upside down. Since most organizations do the 20%, almost all the value you can create comes in the next 80% of the effort. Most organizations (and most people) settle for 20%, hit the Dip and move on to the next thing. A few people insist on devoting an unreasonable amount of effort into something. They cross the Dip and get rewarded handsomely for it.

Marketing time,"Smart marketers already know that marketing is more than advertising. Here’s one tactic that might be overlooked: time.
Domino’s rode this for a while with 30 minute delivery. Fedex still does. But using time as part of your story can be a lot more subtle than that.
At a conference I recently attended, the group was 50 minutes behind schedule after only 2 hours of the program. For the speakers, the message was, ""I’m important, as important as the last guy, so since he went over ten minutes, I will too."" For the audience, the message was, ""this is a conference about the guys on the stage, not about us.""
When a doctor overbooks her schedule and it’s typical to wait ten or thirty minutes for an appointment, then the story is made really clear to the patient. Who’s more important? And doesn’t this marketing effort affect the way the patient and the doctor communicate?
A contractor that prides himself on finishing every single job on the day it’s due, regardless of what it takes, is telling a powerful story, doing marketing that’s actually cheaper and more effective than advertising ever could be.",,"marketing, time, customer experience"
Going too far,"Sometimes, organizations tell a story that works. And then they overreach. They believe that they have the ability to expand the story, to move it beyond where their authenticity lies. It’s very tempting to do this, because the old story was so effective and people are giving you the benefit of the doubt. The challenge is, once your new story is discovered to be a fraud, your old story starts to be scrutinized even more closely, you no longer have goodwill or momentum and the whole thing falls apart.
I accidentally brought a grapefruit with me on my last trip to Florida. Tucked it into my carry on, didn’t eat it at the airport and forgot about it. A big grapefruit. A juicy one. No one questioned it.

The brand formula,"What’s a brand?
I think it is the product of two things:
[Prediction of what to expect] times [emotional power of that expectation].
If I encounter a brand and I don’t know what it means or does, it has zero power. If I have an expectation of what an organization will do for me, but I don’t care about that, no power.
Fedex is a powerful brand because you always get what you expect, and the relief you get from their consistency is high.
AT&T is a weak brand because you almost never get what you expect, because they do so many different things and because the value of what they create has little emotional resonance (it sure used to though, when they did one thing, they did it perfectly and they were the only ones who could connect you).
The dangers of brand ubiquity are then obvious. When your brand is lots of things (like AOL became) then the expectations were all over the place and the emotional resonance started to fade. If the predictability of your brand starts to erode its emotional power (a restaurant that becomes boring) then you need to become predictable in your joyous unpredictability!
If you want to grow a valuable brand, my advice is to keep awareness close to zero among the people you’re not ready for yet, and build the most predictable, emotional experience you can among those that care about you.","April 24, 2007","Branding, Emotional Resonance, Predictability"

Ego,"Just about every book publisher, including mine, has a beautifully lit display case of their books in the lobby. And just about every author, including me, looks at the display case when he walks in, hoping (expecting?) to see one of his books there.

Sure, we’ll know you put it there just because you knew we were coming, but we can’t help but wonder whether it’s always there. And even if we know you put it there just for us, that’s a nice thing, isn’t it? That’s a big part of what the author is paying you for.
And of course, the same thing true is for any business. If I come back to your website and you know my name, why not plaster it across the page? If I come to your fancy restaurant for dinner, why not ask me about some of my preferences on the phone and laser print a menu that highlights some of my faves. Or better yet, the waiter (with help from a computer) should remember that I loved the cucumber soup and maybe he can let me know the chef will make it again if I’d like.

Just because they say it,"I get more complaints about the bad customer service provided by cell phone companies than just about any other sort of organization. It’s the combination of broken promises, bad attitude and the perception that the service is so important they better be good.
So why am I dubious aboutVoce?(thanks,Cory). The deal: they charge you a lot and they give you a lot. Human beings who care. Phones that get answered. Free loaner phones for travel… you get the idea.
Given the millions of people who are already spending more than $2000 a year for a cell phone, you’d think there’d be a line out the door for a service like this one. But my guess is it’ll be a slow growth curve. Because we don’t trust them.
We’re waiting for the bait and switch, for the service to fade out, to be stuck, once again with a company that doesn’t care. It might very well be that this time it’s different.
The challenge to a marketer that chooses to enter a market with a miserable history of customer abuse is obvious: you can claim to be better, to be unevil, benevolent even, but people just aren’t prepared to believe you.

Meetings,"I had breakfast today with a senior executive who estimates she spends more than 30% of her time in internal meetings.
My guess is that many marketers (who seem to go to more meetings than most people) might envy a number that low.
Despite the time spent, most people don’t seem particularly happy with the results the meetings create. In that spirit, I want to share some radical thoughts on how you could completely change the meeting dynamic in your organization.
DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEETINGS. It’s a huge mistake to just show up in a conference room and have a meeting. If the expectation is ‘yet another meeting’, then the odds are, you’ll have yet another meeting.
Here are a few very distinct types of meetings:
There are more, of course, and your situation is special, but in general, you ought to be able to clearly delineate what an ideal meeting is like, and then make it happen.
TIPS: I think most of the time, most meetings should be held without chairs. People standing up think more quickly and get distracted less often. And the meetings don’t last as long.
All day meetings should be banned. Meetings that attempt to accomplish more than one of the tasks above should be banned.
Bonus tip: Last person to walk in the door pays $10 to the coffee fund.
Extra bonus tip: hire someone to come in and videotape a few of your standard meetings. Watch what happens.
Last tip: if there’s someone senior in the group who comes to meetings, spouts off and then either changes his mind or doesn’t take action, start asking people to sign in to meetings (with a pen) and then, when the meeting is over, sign out (with a pen) on a document that you create in the meeting that says what you did and what’s going to happen next.

Welcome to offer world,"Do a googlesearchforBob Ray, and you’ll end up withthis pageas the first match. This is as it should be. If you already know you want to buy some Bob and Ray recordings, you’re motivated enough to poke around and find what you want.
What makes something a good page for the motivated searcher doesn’t necessarily translate into a page that can pay for itself with offers.
Do a search on ‘comedy’ and if you’re in the right part of the world, you might encounter the ad on the left (in a black box) for an Andrew Dice Clay concert that’s taking place in New Jersey.The organization running this ad is hoping that a big enough percentage of those clicking on it will convert so they can run the ad more often.
The problem with this offer is that it is slapped on top of a page that was never intended to convert someone who had responded to an offer. The page it links to looks like this.
So, what happens when an advertiser runs an offer and connects to a page like this? They blame the offer. They blame the medium. They complain that it just doesn’t work for them.
Of course it doesn’t work!
Not because of the offer but because of the page the offer connected to. And even if the page was perfectly formatted, it’s unlikely it would work. Why? Because it’s unlikely that you’re going to be able to turn someone from a stranger (pre-offer) into a loyal customer with a single page.
Smart internet marketers have learned that it’s a step by step process, not an event.
Instead of this:offer —> sale
it works like this:offer—> sample —> permission —> learning —> sample —> sale —> subscription.
If you can’t embrace this, I think you need to walk away from the medium entirely. On the other hand, this is the engine that is capable of growing businesses in a predictable, straightforward way.
I call it an ‘offer culture.’ The same way Lillian Vernon and LL Bean developed a direct mail culture, some organizations are developing an offer culture. They search out new places to run their offers, test them quickly, adjust their landing pages, experiment with how many steps they need between first contact and closed sale… these organizations really understand the value of a long-term customer, because they’ve earned them.
In working with the early advertisers in Squidoo offers, there has been a clear dichotomy between marketers and those making offers. The same thing is obviously true among regular Google adwords buyers. Are you on the bus?

Don’t mess with Mr. In-Between,"Stefan Stern who writes for the Financial Times wrote this review forAccounting and Business,a UK journal foundhere:
Vince Lombardi is one of the most venerated American football coaches in history. The team he built, the Green Bay Packers, won the NFL championship five times in the nine years he was coaching them. And Lombardi came up with one of the world’s most famous motivational commands of all, beloved of managers everywhere: “Quitters never win, and winners never quit.”
Seth Godin, the marketing guru, blogger and best-selling author ofPurple Cow, quotes Lombardi at the start of this slim new book. And Godin’s verdict on the great Lombardi’s views? “Bad advice.”
That is typical Godin, who possesses one of the cheekiest and most energetic voices in business today. That is partly why his latest offering is worth a look even though, at nearly £7 for 100 pages, it might not appear to offer the best value for money. (Well, I did say he was cheeky, didn’t I?)
Godin’s counter-intuitive insight is simply this: winners do quit, they quit all the time, it’s just that they pick the right moment and the right place to quit, so that they can concentrate their fire on an area where winning is a much more likely (and indeed more profitable) outcome.
The book’s title refers to that low point in any task or project where we have to decide whether to carry on with what we are doing – in the hope of overcoming a dip – or whether we should in fact abandon the work in hand and move on. One of our biggest problems, Godin says, is that we fail to recognise when a dip is in fact a cul-de-sac, a dead end. He hails Jack Welch, former chief executive of General Electric, as a boss who knew when certain business units were coming up against a dead end. “Be number one or number two in a sector, or get out of it,” was the Welch doctrine.
Quitting is important because winning is important, Godin says. “Extraordinary benefits accrue to the tiny majority of people who are able to push just a tiny bit longer than most,” he writes. “Extraordinary benefits also accrue to the tiny majority with the guts to quit early and refocus their efforts on something new.”
Godin is the enemy of muddling through, making do, and coping. Either get through the dip and reach for the stars, or find something else to do, he advises. But don’t mess with “Mr Inbetween”.
“The most common response to the dip is to play it safe,” Godin says. “To do ordinary, blameless work, work that’s beyond reproach. When faced with the dip most people ‘suck it up’ and try to average their way to success. Which is precisely why so few people end up the best in the world… The problem with coping is that it never leads to exceptional performance,” he adds. “Mediocre work is rarely because of a lack of talent and often because of the cul-de-sac. All coping does is waste your time and misdirect your energy. If the best you can do is cope, you’re better off quitting.”

Rapport,"Jon from New Zealand writes:
I was amused by my own behaviour this morning.
I was looking for a welder of stainless steel to make up some security gates.
I went to a website list of suitable contractors, clicked on all those in my area and ended up with 25 pages opened. I then called the first one and asked if they could make up something to my drawing. They couldn’t (not their type of business) but I had a very pleasant and helpful discussion with the owner about stainless steel in general.
I then asked if he could suggest anyone else that might be able to do the work. He suggested a name and number. I called them, discussed the project and am waiting for their quote.
I then closed the other 24 web pages – unseen or contacted.
The rapport that I felt (from a perfect stranger) was sufficient to make me take his recommendation and pursue a quote from his referred ""friend"" in preference to the other 24 open pages. Funny that! The need for a personal link goes deep.

Meeting needs,"It’s not often that I disagree with Hugh, but this time, I do:gapingvoid.
The headline of his post is, ""How well does open source currently meet the needs of shareholders and CEOs"". I think this question is part of the problem.
Almost no new idea meets the needs of shareholders and CEOs. That’s because most of all they need predictability and apparent freedom from risk. This is why public companies are almost always on the road to disaster. They flee from change in order to do what they think is meeting the needs of those constituents. They fight changes in laws, policies, technologies and markets because their CEO (especially) wants a nice even flight pattern while he racks up big time options.
Shrink wrap software feels safe. Secure. Supported. Beyond reproach.
But…
It turns out that open source can do a brilliant job of meeting theiractualneeds (lower overhead to install and maintain, higher productivity to use, more stable over time) but the problem is that apparent needs (playing it safe, making your boss happy) almost always get in the way. Until it’s too late. When it’s too late, the competition has leapfrogged you.
Simple example: blogging. Blogging doesn’t seem to fit into the command and control mindset of media companies. It doesn’t seem to have obvious ad-driven or traffic-driven payoffs. It represents a threat (or at least volatility) to the stock price. So they ignore them.

My doctor went to a seminar yesterday ($100+) where the ‘expert’ was busy selling her on buying a domain name, hiring a designer, using web development software, understanding site maps and navigation and keywords and metatags and servers…
These are businesses that have trouble dealing with the Yellow Pages. Too much trouble, too much time, way too expensive. So, should local micro-businesses just ignore the web? Or should they become experts in the art of building and maintaining a website?
We’re talking about people who don’t like to tweak. About local businesses that are struggling to be found by people a block or a mile or five miles away. Entrepreneurs who can’t be bothered to understand typography or HTML. Why does my dog’s vet have such a lame website? Why do basement waterproofing sites sit moribund? Do they all have to become experts and spend the money–or sit it out and lose out?
I think there’s a third way, one that gets them just about everything they need, takes an hour or two a month and costs about $60 a year. Here goes:
Step one: head on over toTypepadand sign up for their cheapest service. It’s about $5 a month. Pick a ‘quiet’ and professional blog layout. Your first post should include the name of your business, your address, your specialty and your hours and phone number. Click the button that says ""Feature this post."" From now on, this post will be at the top of your blog (which is really your ‘website’, so first time visitorswill see it front and center. When you go on vacation or stock a new line of products or have a story to tell, just blog it.
The beauty of this first step is that for $5 you have a web server, a professional layout, no worries about design, a site you can edit yourself in no time and no hassles with weird domain names.
Next step:build a Squidoolensabout your business. List your hours and stuff. Then insert a google map of where you’re located. Put in a list of books if you think your potential (or current) customers will benefit from an understanding of what you do. Insert a guestbook so your favorite customers can give you testimonials. Put in an RSS feed from your blog, so every time you update it, it will show up here, too. If this is too tricky, have your smart next-door-neighbor do it for you. You won’t have to do it again.
Next step: Get a sign featuring your name and phone number. Something 1 foot by 2 foot or so. Printed on cardboard. Now, take your digital camera and start taking pictures. Pictures of your offices. Of your staff. Of your satisfied customers. Each picture should include the sign! Now, go post those pictures onFlickr.(And then put the pictures into a set and pull that set into your Squidoo lens, and post the best pictures on your blog too).
Last step: Ask your best customers to build Squidoo lenses about your business. Ask the ones who blog to mention you in their blogs. Ask the happiest of all to pose for a picture holding your sign, or to give you a testimonial for your blog.
So, you’ve probably invested a few hours by now. You’ve spent a few dollars, read a book or two on blogging. But you haven’t become an expert, not by a longshot, in any technologies. You haven’t tweaked a font or focused on a sitemap. Instead, you’ve been running your dry cleaner or writing your sermons.
Even better, no one is judging you on whether or not you’re an expert at building websites. No one is choosing not to do business with you because your website looks like your cat designed it. And you’re not spending big money tweaking tweaking tweaking just to get the last ounce of blood out of your site.
A month later, if someone types,migraine acupuncture des moines, into Google, they ought to find you. Orpet store 10706.The beauty of your situation is this: if only 5 or 10 new people a week find you via this ring of links and google searches, you’re going to have a shot at doubling your customer base within a year.

Not settling,"TZ wrote to me today. Here’s his story about quitting and then becoming the best in the world:
I rose up the ranks in [name of bank] Bank Financial Group to become a Program Manager in Operations…specifically Change Management.
According to how my parents used to define success: I was a superstar. A 29 year old with a senior level position at a huge company with a safe salary, crazy benefits and a religious adherence to a 9-5 order.
The first 2 years were fueled with idealistic notions of changing the world: I entered my cubicle with enthusiasm every morning and left every day, hoping that next day would be different.
In the beginning, it didn’t even bother me that I wasn’t following my passion (music!), because I had a business card with my name, a fancy title (which was longer than the list of my accomplishments) and the beautiful logo of a major corporation.
I could sit at Starbucks with other bankers on company time and we could laugh about ""fooling the man"".
As time went on, I began to realize that I’m the one being fooled. With every promise of a longer title and bigger salary, I would salivate like one of Pavlov’s dogs and automatically go along with whatever needed to be done to get that bigger office.
I realized that advancement was less about changing for better and more about maintaining the status quo. In big corporations, senior management always seeks out ideas from idealistic middle managers to give them a sense of hope and a promise of a better tomorrow that keeps the drones at least half alive.
So I continued to create fancy power point slides with generic expressions like:
""well positioned for growth""  – translation: we’re not saying we WILL grow…we’re just sayin….we might.
""adding value"" – question: WTF did everyone think they were getting paid for? Not adding value? Why does it have to be on every slide?!
""leveraging"" , – comment: i asked everyone on my team not to use those words. the frequency of use of words like ""leverage"" is inversely proportionate to the amount of original thought. the more you say ""leverage"", the less you’ve probably thought about what you’re saying.
Because I used the language of my audience, my presentations were always a big smash! As much as a presentations that ""encourage change with minimal change"" can be.
In short, I became resentful toward the corporation for setting up a hampster wheel and resentful toward myself for staying in that very wheel, in exchange for cash, titles and security.
So I left.
My wife and I moved to a cheaper place, I got rid of my BMW and we began to try to live on 30K a year.
From a huge corporation, I went to a music production house with 10 people.
I started at less than half my bank salary and I worked the longest hours I’ve ever worked. Good thing all the stores were closed when I’d leave the studio, that way I wouldn’t spend the money.
This was 6 months ago.
Today my salary has jumped, in direct proportion to my contributions, to almost what I made at the bank.
I have no clearly defined responsibilities….my title is whatever I want it to be….the only mandate is: do the things that make us the top production house in the city.
I’m having the time of my life and in less than 6 months, I have accomplished more in a small business with minimal budgets than I have in 5 years in a huge bank with billion dollar revenues.","April 13, 2007","Quit, Passion, Transformation"
I’d ignore him too,"I got more mail aboutthis storyin the Washington Post than any other non-blog topic ever. I saw it when it first came out, but didn’t blog it because I thought the lesson was pretty obvious to my readers. [World-class violinist plays for hours in a subway station, almost no one stops to listen]. The experiment just proved what we already know about context, permission and worldview. If your worldview is that music in the subway isn’t worth your time, you’re not going to notice when the music is better than usual (or when a famous violinist is playing). It doesn’t match the story you tell yourself, so you ignore it. Without permission to get through to you, the marketer/violinist is invisible.
But why all the mail? (And the Post got plenty too). Answer: I think it’s because people realized that if they had been there, they would have done the same thing. And it bothers us.
It bothers us that we’re so overwhelmed by the din of our lives that we’ve created a worldview that requires us to ignore the outside world, most of the time, even when we suffer because of it. It made me feel a little smaller, knowing that something so beautiful was ignored because the marketers among us have created so much noise and so little trust.
I don’t think the answer is to yell louder. Instead, I think we have an opportunity to create beauty and genius and insight and offer it in ways that train people to maybe, just maybe, loosen up those worldviews and begin the trust.",,"worldview, perception, attention"
I need a few quitters,"I’m trying to assemble a list of a dozen or so people who have achieved the status of ‘best in the world,’ but quit something else in order to get there. Example: Scott Adams, creator of Dilbert, was a mid-level cubicle-dwelling drone at PacBell, and would be to this day if he hadn’t quit. Suze Orman was a broker at Prudential-Bache before she quit and created an empire.

Marketing to seniors (open and closed),"It’s common knowledge among marketers that marketing to seniors is largely a waste of time. All you need to do is look at the ads in Modern Maturity magazine compared to, say, Rolling Stone, to see what marketers believe.
The reason most believe this is because of a simple distinction: open and closed.
Open people are seeking out things that they believe will make their lives better. Experiences and products and styles that will open doors, cause growth, save time and money and increase status. All of these things are ‘go up’ events. Find people who are open and you find people you can talk to.
Closed people are trying to maintain the status quo. They are very focused on keeping things from getting worse, but they’re not particularly concerned about joining the in crowd or starting something.
For a long time, the easy way out was to believe that 18 to 34 year olds were open and seniors were closed. Web surfers are open, National Enquirer readers are closed. etc. etc.
Then the baby boom happened.
Baby boomers have been open their whole lives. And now they are seniors. So all the conventional wisdom goes out the window. Senior travel, senior fashion, senior experiences… it’s all fair game, because there’s a different demographic inhabiting that age group now.
Psychographics (open vs. closed) are way more important than demographics.","April 12, 2007","Marketing, Seniors, Psychographics"
Do you have to be anti-change to be pro-business?,"A few months ago, I heard an interview with one of the leading metal baseball bat manufacturers. They were lobbying hard against regulations that would require little league players to use wood bats.
Today, Chris point us tothis storyabout emissions. The car makers continue to lobby hard, or even sue, over emission rules. Wendy’s, as previously discussed, is working hard against a rule in New York requiring they post calorie counts. It’s common wisdom that government regulation is bad for business, and especially bad is regulation that requires change.
I don’t get it.
A few years ago, the FTC changed the law about how wide apart the bars in cribs for children had to be. Wide spaces between bars end up strangling kids and breaking arms. The law only applied to home cribs, which meant that hospital cribs weren’t covered. Hard Manufacturing, my favorite hospital crib company, took the regulation to heart and alerted every hospital in the country that the cribs they were using weren’t deemed safe for home use… so why use them in a hospital? What do you think happened to crib sales? It was a huge few years as the cribs were replaced (and the kids ended up safer).
Wendy’s did the best when they were growing with the launch of salads. Not when they were copying McDonald’s over burgers. Change is their friend.
If I were a leading bat company, I’d formulate a ‘slower’ metal bat that would be just as safe as wood… and unbreakable too. What a marketing coup! Then I’d lobby like crazyforchange.
If I were Ford Motor, I’d lobby as hard as possible for the strictest emissions regime in the world. If you’re losing the game, change the rules. Start over. Be the only major car company to produce 100% zpev or hybrid cars.
Business as usual is almost always lousy marketing, because there isn’t a lot of room for growth. The opportunities kick in when an external force requires a brand new story, when consumers are choosing to pay attention because they’ve got no other choice.
It’s easy to argue against change. It disheartens shareholders and even employees. But external change is the most likely lever of growth, because it puts you back on the agenda of attention.",,"Change, Regulation, Business Growth"

The mechanics of word of mouth,"Last weekend, I saw The Hoax, with Richard Gere. It’s a fantastic movie, one of the best I’ve seen in a while. As soon as it ended, I had a compulsion to tell you about it. So I sat down and had a long talk with myself about why.
Why was it so important to me to tell other people? It’s not a movie that will make the world a better place. It won’t increase my reputation or give me a sense of power to be able to tell people about it. So why?
I don’t know. It’s just a really good movie.
Sometimes, we worry so much about tracking and selfish actions and mechanics that we ignore the biggest factor: people like to talk about stuff.
Which leads to thisterrific commentaryabout the #1 song in America. Irony alert: it’s tongue in cheek. My guess is that listeners on the radio today didn’t get it. I’m glad to say I did.

The seven reasons,"Seven Reasons You Might Fail to Become the Best in the World
By “you,” I mean your team, your company, or just plain you, the jobseeker, employee, or entrepreneur. The important thing to remember about these seven things is that you can plan for them. You can know before you start whether or not you have the resources and the will to get to the end. Most of the time, if you fail to become the best in the world, it’s either because you planned wrong or because you gave up before you reached your goal.
Even worse than quitting in the first six cases: not quitting. Settling. Sticking with it but not succeeding.
Is it possible that you’re just not good enough? That you (or your team) just don’t have enough talent to be the best in the world? Sure, it’s possible. In fact, if your chosen area is the cello, or speed skating, then I might even say it’s probable. But in just about every relevant area I can think of, no, it’s not likely. Youaregood enough.

Useless marketing,"That’s what florist David says is the value of marketing torecipients of flowers.Zero. Useless.
What a great way to get a post out of me!
You can market bytellingor you can market byshowing.There’s no doubt that interactive marketing, marketing where you actually deliver something of value, is far far more powerful than telling. Telling is just bragging. Telling is ignored. Showing, on the other hand, is about me. Me, me, me! It’s about providing an interactive experience that touches me.
What a great opportunity to do just that. I might be crazy, but my guess is that people who get flowers are also people who give flowers. And my guess is that giving someone an extraordinary experience when they get the flowers is the best way in the world to turn that person into a sender, too.

Stinky Durian,"Durian is a fruit from Southeast Asia that can be charitably described as smelling like stale baby vomit. It is also revered by millions and served with pride in many Thai and Malaysian households. Most of all, it’s a great way to learn about marketing.
Songpol Somsri, a scientist fascinated by the durian, has spent decades cross-breeding more than 90 varieties of Durian and come up with a stinkless variety. No odor.
This is what most marketers do. They listen to complaints from non-customers (""why don’t you buy from us?"") address them and wait for the market to grow. After all, if the people who don’t eat Durian don’t eat it because of the smell, then removing the smell ought to dramatically increase the size of your market.
Except this almost never works.
Non-durian eaters don’t have a ‘durian problem’. They aren’t standing by, fruitless, impatiently waiting for Songpol Somsri to figure out how to make a stinkless one. Nope. They’ve got cantaloupes and kiwis and all manner of other fruits to keep them busy.
The feedback you get from non-consumers is rarely useful, because the objection they give is the reason theydon’tbuy from you, not the thing that will cause them to affirmatively choose you.
Will stinkless durian revolutionize the marketplace? Possibly. I’ve been wrong before. But if I were a durian farmer,I’d work hard to make durian stinkier.",,"Durian, marketing, consumer behavior"

The Best in the World imperative,"Ultimately, The Dip is a marketing book, because the thesis is that being seen as best in the world, whatever ‘best’ and whatever ‘world’ means, is the single greatest contributor to success in marketing. There are three reasons why this is more important than ever:
SELECTION: Getting into Harvard or being crowned Miss America are valuable achievements for just one reason: they make it easy for everyone to see you won. Someone adds value by performing a selection process, and the lucky ones who get picked, the anointed, win. The marketplace values this because we’re too busy to do the selecting ourselves.
ACCESS: Because of the web, we don’t have to limit our choices to the Yellow Pages or who’s nearby or who was recommended by a friend. As a result, with far more choices, we can pick the very best choice, not the most convenient one.
PYRAMIDS: Many systems only work when there are a lot of entries but just a few winners. Whether it’s the US Open or the economics of the local gym, it’s the effort and expense of the non-winners that supports the benefits of the winners. These pyramids are getting more common because of the winner-take-all nature of our world.Diggwouldn’t work if there were only a few stories a day submitted.

All a rhetorical way of pointing out that businesses (and people) do two things. Most of focus on just one (at least when we’re doing the task at hand) which is the task at hand. But, there’s something else that’s far more important, something disconnected from what’s produced but certainly related: how you made the customer feel.

Where does hypercompetition come from?,"The candidates for president have already raised more than a hundred million dollars. After only three months. Every single one of the top five candidates demolished the record set eight years ago.
The reason is simple: once a market gets understood, the desire to be the winner in a winner takes all event encourages people to up the ante.
Imagine playing poker with a bunch of kids. If you give each kid $200 in fake chips and play no-limit, they start betting with $1 or maybe $5 bets. Pretty soon, though, one of the kids will figure out that if he betsallhis money, he can make an impact, and perhaps eliminate the other players. Without the risk of losing real money, he instantly goes to 11 on the impact meter. Everyone else follows suit. Hypercompetitiveness.
During the first dot com boom, it became clear after a year or two that the company that could lose the most money the fastest (while attracting some metric… traffic, customers, whatever) would be deemed the winner by Wall Street. Hence the rapid success of theglobe.com, the debacle of pets.com and the insanely high price paid for bluemountainarts. It’s not rational, but it’s true.
As the internet makes it easier for people to keep score of market share, bestseller lists and more, the benefits to being seen as #1 continue to increase. Which means that this trend to being hypercompetitive, whether or not its rational, is going to get more and more common.
The long term hasn’t gone away. Not at all. Winning in the long run is far more important. At the same time, it’s essential to note that many markets have set up short-term screens that make it impossible to survive in the long run if you’re not seen as apossiblemarket leader (the best in the world) early on.","April 5, 2007","hypercompetition, market dynamics, short-term vs long-term"
In praise of a blank page,"A friend just sent me a book he worked on. It’s a terrific book, but it has an astonishingly mediocre (if that’s possible) cover. I can just see how the cover came to be. There were proposals and meetings and compromises and a deadline.  As the deadline loomed, the compromises came more often, until they ended up with a cover that didn’t match the power of the book.
They should have just shipped a cover that was blank.
Knowing that you need to ship a blank cover if you can’t come up with something great focuses the mind and takes the edge of the conversations about compromise. If ‘good enough’ isn’t good enough, and if the alternative is certain failure, people will dig in and come up with something better.
It’s not just book covers, of course.Ethanolis the equivalent of this book cover. It feels like it might be a good enough solution to a range of energy problems. And once embraced, it serves as a bandaid, making the problem less urgent, ""oh, we already took care of that,"" and allowing people to move on to something else.
Every quarter, your company ships new products or services. And every quarter, someone says, ""under the circumstances,"" or ""given the deadline"" or ""with the team we had available""… it’s the best we could do. I say ship nothing.
In a few of my seminars, I’ve encouraged marketers to refuse to market mediocre stuff if that’s the best the folks in R&D and production can bring you. The first time, they’ll be shocked. Your job will be at risk. But then you’ll notice something… the stuff gets better. Fast.
In Japanese car factories, this is calledkanban.You trade production efficiencies for quality. If a part isn’t perfect, the worker refuses to install it.And the entire assembly line stops. Detroit was horrified by this idea. Keeping the assembly line going is the holy grail. Guess what? The line doesn’t get stopped very often. Things get better, fast.
[Ralph Bernstein, at Productivity Press, knows his stuff about Kanban. He writes:
In your posting, In praise of a blank page, your use of the word kanban is incorrect. Kanban refers to a type of visual control that signals an upstream operation to deliver what is needed. (The Wikipedia description to which you linked touches on aspects of the concept, but doesn’t get it exactly right.)
What you probably meant was andon.
An andon is a device that calls attention to defects, equipment abnormalities and other problems, or reports the status and needs of a system by means of colored lights. Typically, when a worker on a line encounters a problem, he or she will pull a cord that lights up the andon board and stops the line.
Also, it’s a little misleading to say that in such a system, you trade production efficiencies for quality. It’s a lot more efficient to stop and eliminate a defect immediately than to repair a finished product (or dozens of finished products) containing the defect. But you are right about one thing: with this kind of system, things do get better fast.

Take a risk?,"Most marketers will do just about anything to persuade people that buying their product is risk free. Hey, we even use terms like ""risk free!"" and ""money back guarantee if not satisfied"". Business to business sellers often rank risk as the #1 reason organizations don’t end up buying from them.
I wonder.
Word of mouth is directly proportional to risk. If I take a risk and it works out, I tell everyone. If there was no risk, it’s not interesting (remarkable) and that’s the end of that.
""You took quite a risk trying our service/believing in our product/sticking with us and we appreciate it.""
Brand pioneers and early adopters are proud of their stance. It makes us feel good to share war stories. Be proud of your risk takers and they’ll return the favor. Create products that are riskier to adopt and if you can get over the hump, you’ll be rewarded with buzz.","April 3, 2007","risk, marketing, word of mouth"
"NOBS, the end of the MBA","[Seven years ago (!) I wrote a column for Fast Company about a different kind of MBA. I’ve gotten tons of email about it, most of it positive–but I did get one particularly desperate/angry note from a validation-seeking student last week. Coincidentally, I just received this beautiful diploma, suitable for framing, for Dan Limbach, who volunteered to share it with you.]
[here’s the original article, with a few updates in brackets]
I thought maybe I’d open a business school. This is particularly ironic given my past: No student in the history of the Stanford Graduate School of Business has ever come closer to not receiving an MBA than yours truly.
When I was at Stanford (it seems like decades ago — probably because it was), I thought that the environment there was terrific, and I truly enjoyed some of my classes. But before the start of my second year, I got an irresistible job offer — which prompted me to try to go to school and work at the same time. I soon realized that the classes were in Palo Alto, and the job was in Boston. But, thanks to some help from TWA and a bizarre willingness on my part to fly on the red-eye, I managed to commute for a semester. After that, a kindly professor decided to stop the madness and just give me the rest of my credits, so graduate I did.
Despite my less-than-stellar attendance record at business school, I’ve since found that teaching business is a blast. I taught a class to second-year students at NYU this year and discovered that aggravating 90 soon-to-be-graduating students is great fun. I had so much fun, in fact, that I started thinking about what business school is, what it’s good for — and what it’s not good for at all.
As far as I can tell, there are only three reasons to apply to business school. My [imaginary] school, the New Order Business School (NoBS), will focus on excelling at all three.
First, business school provides a tremendous screen for future employers. If you go to Harvard Business School, for example, you are doing a tremendous thing for your personal branding, and you are guaranteed a job interview — at the very least — virtually anywhere in the world. When it comes to business, Columbia, Stanford, Wharton, and a few other schools aspire to Harvard’s level. And in some industries, they even surpass it.
Just as Internet investors have successfully trained themselves to look past the present and to invest in companies that have a wonderful future, some employers have realized that waiting for someone to graduate from one of these august institutions is a waste of time. Instead of hiring students after they finish classes (which, after all, don’t teach why the brand is so valuable), why not just hire people as soon as they’ve been accepted to business school?
The student who drops out of school after getting in but before beginning classes saves about $55,000 in tuition — as well as another $180,000 in opportunity cost. Add to that the stock options and a chance to change the world that much sooner, and you can see why this is a no-brainer for all involved.
At NoBS, we offer a special program for just this sort of student. Basically, it’s the most exclusive business-school admissions program in the country. We guarantee that only one out of every 1,000 applicants will be accepted to our school. And we guarantee that upon being accepted, every single person will receive at least three job offers — each with a minimum salary of $65,000 a year.
The fee to have your application considered is $300. After all, as an admissions-based institution — actually, as an admissions-only institution — we have to do a great job, so it’s $300 well spent.
There are few classes. There is no degree. You apply. You get in (or, more likely, you don’t). That’s it. We’re done. (Oh, and by the way, the profit margins are huge! But you figured that out already.)
Think about the prestige associated with being the one in 1,000. Think about the pride in knowing that you are one of the few people smart enough, motivated enough, and crazy enough to apply to a school that exclusive. Stuck in a dead-end job? Work like crazy on your GMATS and your essay, and you too may be able to break through the clutter of applicants and become a NoBS standout.
The second reason that people go to school is to build a network. This is another way of saying that there’s a social insurance policy among students. If someone in your class actually becomes successful or lands a powerful job, the rest of you have someone to go to for favors or even cash.
It’s sort of astonishing how powerful networking can be. One investor I know gives preference to companies whose staff includes an alumnus of Camp Tahigwa. Employees don’t necessarily have to have attended Camp Tahigwa at the same time that the investor did — so long as they know the same camp songs.
At NoBS, we offer a concentrated program, half of which focuses on just this sort of networking. Rather than waiting for networking to occur through random osmosis — through unpredictable events like working on a project together in Cost Accounting 101 — students at NoBS gather for two weeks every six months to engage in some intense team building. They row crew. They play chess. They build houses for the disadvantaged. They stay up all night putting a VW Beetle on the roof of Larry Ellison’s home.
The third (and least important) reason to go to business school is actually to learn something. And this is where traditional business schools really fail. The core curriculum at business schools is as close to irrelevant as you can imagine. If you and I were trying to create a series of courses that would all but guarantee that upon graduating, students would have no useful knowledge about how to do business in the new economy, today’s business-school curriculum would be a great model for us.
So eliminating the curriculum may be a great idea. But sooner or later, the illusion of a thriving, useful institution will fade if a business school doesn’t offer any courses. Ask people who are thriving in today’s economy to name five things that helped them succeed, and they’ll probably come up with a list like this one.
1. Finding, hiring, and managing super-great people
2. Embracing change and moving quickly
3. Understanding and excelling at business development and at making deals with other companies
4. Prioritizing tasks in a job that changes every day
5. Selling — to people, to companies, and to markets
There are other skills that might show up on the list — for example, balancing a life for the long term, working with venture capitalists and other sources of funds, being creative, and understanding the impact of new technologies — but this is a good starting place.
Now take a look at the core curriculum for a $55,000 MBA. You’ll find virtually no focus at all on any of these five issues. My MBA students at NYU had never taken a selling course, they had never been taught how to give a presentation, but they were experts in cost accounting, in understanding manufacturing efficiencies, and in applying the Black and Scholes Option Pricing Formula.
People in the real world buyhow-to booksto figure out how to succeed. So the NoBS curriculum includes only courses that are worthy of being the subject of a best-selling book. And whenever possible, the authors themselves teach the courses. (In fact, my facetiousness aside, you can learn 100% of the MBA curriculum at home, in a month, just by reading books. I’ll go one step further: I can condense an hour of class presentation into 10 book pages. If you can discipline yourself to read, you can free up two years of your life for the good stuff!)
The last thing to consider about business school is that in many cases, precisely the wrong people attend. Instead of filling their classrooms with people who are too kind to go to law school, business schools ought to find people who are already in the business world, but who are panicking because they don’t know as much as they want to know. Instead of looking for people who are working two mind-numbing years at a bank while waiting to get into a top institution, schools ought to seek out entrepreneurs who are champing at the bit to get their businesses started.
There are two kinds of people who don’t belong in business school: the talented folks who are in too much of a hurry to spend time studying and the dull ones who don’t have anything better to do.
The paradox, of course, is that the best people aren’t prepared to leave their life behind for two years. They’re in a hurry.
So at NoBS, students only need to attend classes for four weeks every six months. The rest of the school runs online for two hours every day. And the MBA is completed in less than a year.
During the four weeks of live stuff, we all fly to some off-season ski resort with excellent food, decent rooms, and an Olympic-sized swimming pool. Classes run from 8 am to midnight, three days a week. The rest of the week, students teach one another from real-life anecdotes. Sharing life experiences prepares people for the arrival of unexpected events.
The “faculty” isn’t really a faculty at all. There are no PhDs in the bunch — not one. Instead, our teachers are compelling public speakers, the kind of people who get standing ovations. People like Zig Ziglar on selling, Tom Peters on embracing change, or Regis McKenna on public relations.
Sound like a powerful experience? Totally nonaccredited. No bureaucracy. One dean. Drop out if you want. Do it for the learning, not for the grades. Everybody is as motivated as you are. Get it over with in just nine months. Walk out with a great credential and 100 lifelong friends.
Is NoBS yet another bizarre thought exercise on my part? Probably. [for the irony-impaired: yes]
NoBS is worth considering. Before you go to business school, before you decide that a fancy MBA is the one thing standing between you and success, you ought to think really hard about why you’re going and what you’re going to learn.
And that, of course, goes double for any company itching to hire the latest freshly minted MBA. Perhaps instead of letting a 300-year-old institution do your screening for you, you should start your own business school. Bring in 100 kids. Put them through the real curriculum in four weeks. Keep half, and pay the other half a year of severance (or have them lick envelopes until they find another job).
It’s easy to forget that business school is a thoroughly modern phenomenon — that it’s not rooted in the ancient canons of Shakespeare or even Madame Curie. Most modern business schools were founded in the 1960s. Their time has come and gone.
[Updated in 2020, twenty years after I wrote this original rant.Since then, thealtMBAhas turned into a legitimate life-changing institution. 5,000 graduates from more than seventy countries. From companies large and small. From non-profits, educational institutions and government agencies. From age 16 to 80.
The altMBA is now independent of its founder, part of a B corp. organized to work in the public interest, owned and run by a passionate team of change-makers, and most important, attended by people who know that there’s something more to work.
No gurus, no tests, no focus on scarcity. Instead, it’s a chance to learn together and to make a difference.]",,"MBA, business school, NoBS"

Sonya points us tothis articleabout the cruel reality of college admissions. I happen to think that almost all of it is money-driven, insecurity-fueled foolishness, a bogus nexus of lies, fears and greed, but more on that later.
For right now, the key lesson is this: colleges (the most coveted ones, anyway) are picky. That means they have a choice. And given a choice, they always do the same thing: they pick the best in the world. It’s quite a Dip, one that most students ought to reject in my opinion. Instead, egged on by guidance counselors with a vested interest and parents who mean well but don’t see the problem, they throw themselves into the system, almost certain to get stuck in the Dip instead of playing a different game altogether.

"One, a few, most or all","There are four kinds of marketing situations, and the approach to each is radically different. Yet most of the time, we lump them together as just plain ‘marketing’.
If you are trying to sell a house or fill a job, you only need to persuadeone person.
If you want to make your book sell a bunch of copies, your restaurant to be filled on Saturday night or your coaching practice to have a full schedule, you need to sell afewpeople.
On the other hand, viral bestsellers, killer websites and essential conferences hit their stride whenmostpeople in a marketplace have been converted. You can’t get elected President (most years, anyway) without persuading most of the people who vote.
Lastly, when the market is defined right, there are situation in which you need to persuadeallof the people involved. If you need 51 Senators to agree with you on a bill, or if you need the purchasing committee at a big company to buy your software, then you need a unanimous decision.
This four-way distinction is important for two reasons. First, because you often have a choice. You can choose which approach your venture will take on its way to accomplishing its goals. Gandhi didn’t needmostof the people to change India, he instead relied on a smallerfew,but with more passion than most politicians are able to generate.
You could, for example, plan a business that works once almost everyone adopts it (like eBay) or you could alter the business so it works just fine if a much smaller universe of people embrace it (likethreadless). Worth noting that neither business would work if just a few people showed up.37Signalshas done a great job of designing web products that only need to be sold to afewpeople, and then those people do the hard work of gettingeveryonein their organization to use them.
Here’s a quick list of how the four differ:
ONE: You’re a needle, the market is a haystack. Make your needle as sharp as you can, put it in as many haystacks as you can afford. Alternatively, you’ve already decided on your one (the date for the prom or the perfect job). In that case, throw the haystack out and engage in a custom, one-on-one patient effort to tell your story to the person who needs to hear it.
A FEW: Being exceptional matters most. Stand out, don’t fit in. Shun the non-believers.
MOST: Amplify the excitement of the few and make it easy for them to spread the story to the caring majority.
ALL: Compromise. You need to be many things to many people, embraced by the passionate but not offensive to the masses. Sooner or later, the issue for the reluctant part of the buyer community is that it becomes more expensive/risky to stand in the way of the group than it is to go along.
Blogs, for now, are almost always about thefew.Google and Starbucks and the iPod are exciting stories because they’ve moved from the few to themost.The most important industry trade shows make huge profits because they’ve transitioned to theall.

Pundits are (nearly) always wrong,"Here’s why:
Because we measure the wrong thing.
Talk show bookers, business plan competitions, acquiring book editors, movie critics, tech entrepreneurs who run trade shows that try to predict the future, tech bloggers, marketing bloggers… when we’re trying to predict whether a new technology or web site or book or song is going to hit, we’re almost always wrong.
Take a look at some of the picks for past web2 shows, or see who got hyped on various morning TV programs or see which authors were turned down by five or ten or fifteen publishing houses… ""surprise hits"" they call them.
[Uncharacteristically, I’m leaving out the names of the clueless and the misinformed (other than me). I’m not sure why, I guess I just don’t want to have a fight with people, who, unlike me, are unwilling to admit they’re wrong all the time.]
The astonishing thing isn’t that we’re wrong so often (see below) but that given the amplifying power of our platforms, we’re unable to yell loud enough to make our predictions self-fulfilling prophecies. In English: You’d think that being featured by a big publisher or at a big conference would be enough in and of itself to make something undeserving a hit. Alas, onlyOprahcan do that.
So, why are we wrong? Why does your boss/in-law/friend/VC/editor/pundit always get it wrong?
Because they measure ‘presentation.’ Not just the PPT presentation, but the way an idea feels. How does it present. Is it catchy? Clever? Familiar? We measure whether or not it agrees with our worldview and our sense of the way the world is.
The problem is that hitschangeworldviews. Hitschangeour senses. Hits appeal to people other than the gatekeepers and then the word spreads.
How? Through persistence and hard work and constant revision. By getting through theDip.
If I have a skill in developing stuff, it’s in ignoring these people.Purple Cowwas turned down by my old publisher and a few others.Squidoowas dissed by some of the best in the business (the site is about to hit 8 mm monthly page views).The Dipwas a hard sell to my agent and my publisher.
No one ‘pre-predicted’ the astonishing success of Flickr or Google or Twitter or Bill Clinton’s first run for President. Sure, it was easy to connect the dots after the fact, but that doesn’t count.
Of course, there are plenty of failures to go around (I know that I’ve got more than plenty). Just because everyone hates it doesn’t mean it’s good. Execution is everything. Execution and persistence and the ability to respond to the market far outweigh a pundit’s gut instinct. But, the thing to remember is this: if everyone loves it, it is almost certain to have troubles.
In fact, my rule of thumb is this: if the right people like it, I’m not trying hard enough.",,"pundits, predictions, success"

If you’re doing your best, only your AYSO soccer coach cares. If you’re the best in the world, the market cares. The secret, if you have limited resources (don’t we all) is to make ‘world’ small enough that you can actually accomplish that.","May 29, 2007","success, expertise, market positioning"

Who should you hire?,"Most fast-growing organizations are looking for people who can get stuff done.

And yet, we’re still trying to hire people who have shown an ability to follow instructions.

Beyond the Dip,"Ernie really comes up with some winners here:Dips, Dead Ends, Joyrides, Lotteries, and Quests � iHack, therefore iBlog.
Here’s a taste:
Joyrides are things you do just for the fun of it, without caring if you’re getting anywhere. Seth himself said (roughly) that “if you play the flute just because you enjoy it, not because you’re trying to make a living as a flautist, then The Dip doesn’t matter.” It is worth noting that for some people college is Joyride, not a Dip!
Lotteries are a particularly seductive variant of Dead End that looks like a Dip, in that we periodically see people who do make it out into the Good Life.  Unlike a Dip, though, there is nothing we can do to ensure we make it through to the other side; we are at the mercy of external forces. Thus, even thought there is a non-zero chance we might win the Lottery, for most of us it really is a Dead End, and a complete waste of our potential for greatness. This is particularly true for Talent- (rather than Skill-) based disciplines, where the Lottery took place before we were born.
Quests, on the other hand, are Dips that look like Dead Ends. Seth encourages us to pursue Dips where we can make measurable progress towards a well-defined goal. However, he admits that this doesn’t apply to things like cutting-edge scientific research, where there there are no guarantees or guidelines; fortunately, he says people like that won’t be discouraged by anything he says in his book.  🙂
However, I think he overstates the case when he says Quests (like Crick & Watson’s search for DNA) don’t have measurable progress.  They do, but it is a matter of personal growth and accumulated wisdom, not the usual business metrics.  Even though we may not reach what we thought we were aiming for, a worthy Quest enobles us and ends up benefiting humanity.","May 25, 2007","Dips, Quests, Joyrides"

I’m just not that kind of person…,"Craig writes in with a story about a Dyson vacuum:
I have a question for you about buying decisions.
A while back I upgraded my Dyson vacuum cleaner when I got a great deal on the latest model. I had been using my old one for about 5 years or so but it was still in perfect working order. I had even replaced a couple of attachments for it via the Dyson website.I gave my old Dyson to a friend. She had never used a Dyson before and she loved it. So much so that the very next day her own vacuum cleaner was put outside ready for the refuge collection!
But here’s the thing: a few months later the Dyson I gave her stopped working (not sure why, that thing was indestructible) so she decided to buy a new vacuum. Even though the vacuum I gave her was the best she had ever used, she didn’t buy a Dyson.
I was amazed how someone could love a product so much but replace it with an inferior product. I don’t think it was about cost because I told her where she could get an excellent deal on a new Dyson.
This just doesn’t make sense to me so I thought I’d ask if you had any thoughts as to why this happens?
My take: Craig’s friend didn’t see herself as the kind of person who would buy a Dyson. Sure, she mightuseone, especially if it was free. But buying a weird, fancy-looking vacuum is an act of self-expression as much as it’s a way to clean your floors. And the act of buying one didn’t match the way his friend saw herself.
So many of the products and services we use are now about our identity. Many small businesses, for example, won’t hire a coach or a consultant because, “that’s not the kind of organization we are.” Wineries understand that the pricing of a bottle of wine is more important than its label or the wine inside. The price is the first thing that most people consider when they order or shop for wine.

Alignment,"When there’s a gap between someonedoing her jobanddoing the right thing, then management has failed.
Plenty of customer service people would like to do the right thing.They’d like to fix the problem that’s presented to them. Butfrustration hits when the policies and procedures and metrics they’vebeen given to work with won’t let them.
For the last two weeks, the audio version ofThe Diphas been for sale at the iTunes music store. And for many iPods, it doesn’t work. Hundreds of people havewrittento me and let me know. These hundreds of people have written to Apple, too, and they’ve shared their notes with me.
In general, the responses from Apple that people are reporting are respectful andstraightforward. But none of the responses have addressed the problem. Applecould easily take the product down. Or they could change thedescription in the store with a note that says, ""sorry, but it doesn’twork on some iPods, we’re working on it"", or they could email everyonewho had bought one and let them know what the plans are. And, yes, best of all, theycould fix it.
The amazing thing is that except for the last choice, each approach isfree, quick and relatively easy. If the head of the iTunes storefocused on this problem for ten seconds, it would go away. The challenge isn’t a lack of tools or resources, itis a lack of alignment. For a service rep in this particular situation,""doing my job"" means making the person go away, while ""doing the rightthing"" means taking initiative and actually solving the problem. The customer service reps don’t have access to the tools (or the authority) to do what the company would actually benefit the most from.

Sure, climbing a mountain just because it’s hard is a great hobby. But too often we get caught up in the tactics of getting through the Dip just because we can. Difficulty is not the only thing that makes a Dip worth pursuing. The end result matters too. Seeing the destination and valuing the outcome can make a huge difference in having the ability to push through.","May 23, 2007","Google, Dip, persistence"
I’m liveblogging this,"Enter a new verb. Liveblogging.
When I was in college, WBCN in Boston tried an experiment. They sent DJs to report live from rock concerts. ""We’re here in the Gahden, listening to Bruce Springsteen…"" The thing is, the promoters wouldn’t let them play any of the performances on the radio. So all you heard was breathless commentary on what was happening on stage. ""Oh, could it be? Yes, it is, YES YES Little Stevie is back on stage…"" As you can imagine, the experiment didn’t last long. The DJs had fun, but we were bored.
A few times over the last week, I’ve spoken at conferences where laptops were open and people were online. They were liveblogging, taking notes in real time and posting them online for all to see. At first, this sounds like a fantastic idea. Now, thousands of people can listen on what’s happening in a smaller group.
On closer inspection, it doesn’t work particularly well. I mean, not only was I there, but I was speaking, yet I can’t make sense at all of the posts. That’s because most people don’t take notes to be read. They take notes to write them. The act of writing things down triggers different areas of our brain, it focuses attention, it makes it easier to remember things. You can read your blog notes later and say, ""yeah, I remember that slide…"" But for an outsider who’s not there, the amount of information that’s imparted is small indeed.
Compare these liveblog posts to posts written an hour later, ones that digest and reflect and chunk the information. These are deliberately designed to inform the reader, not to remind the writer.
I don’t mean to pick on the medium. I think it’s incredibly valuable–for the poster. We’re finding a growing dichotomy now, between blogs that help the reader and blogs that helps the writer. And there’s room for both.",,"liveblogging, note-taking, blogging dichotomy"

Too late?,"Here’s today’s entrepreneurial trivia question:
Even after Starbucks had five stores and more than 20 employees, which item was unavailable for purchase at their stores:EspressoHot CoffeeBiscottiFrappucino® blended beverage
Actually, it’s a trick question. The answer is ‘all of the above.’ It wasn’t until several years after the company was up and running that they realized it would be a good idea to sell any beverages at all. All they sold was beans (but you could get a free taste of coffee if you asked nicely).

[More] or (Less),"Many people are arguing for a fundamental change in the way humans interact with the world. This isn’t a post about whether or not we need smaller cars, local produce, smaller footprints and less consumption. It’s a post about how deeply entrenched the desire formoreis.
More has been around for thousands of years. Kings ate more than peasants. Winning armies had more weapons than losing ones. Elizabeth Taylor had more husbands than you.
Car dealers are temples of more. The local Ford dealership lists four different models… by decreasing horsepower. Car magazines feature Bugattis, not Priuses on the cover. Restaurants usually serve more food (and more calories) than a normal person could and should eat.
Is this some sort of character flaw? A defective meme in the system of mankind? Or is it an evil plot dreamed up by marketers?
There’s no doubt that marketers amplify this desire, but I’m certain it’s been around a lot longer than Jell-O.
One reason that the litter campaign of the 1960s worked so well is that ‘not littering’ didn’t require doing less, it just required enough self control to hold on to your garbage for an hour or two. The achilles heel of the movement to limit carbon is the word ‘limit.’
It’s a campaign about less, not more. Even worse, there’s no orthodoxy. There’s argument about whether x or y is a better approach. Argument about how much is enough. As long as there’s wiggle room, our desire for more will trump peer pressure to do less. “Fight global warming” is a fine slogan, except it’s meaningless. That’s like dieters everywhere shouting, “eat less” while they stand in line to get bleu cheese dressing from the salad bar.
As a marketer, my best advice is this: let’s figure out how to turn this into a battle to do more, not less. Example one: require all new cars to have, right next to the speedometer, a mileage meter. And put the same number on an LCD display on the rear bumper. Once there’s an arms race to see who can have thehighestnumber, we’re on the right track.",,"Desire for More, Marketing Influence, Carbon Limitation"

J.A.M. (Just another meeting),"It was so typical. Eight people, the regular bunch. New client kick-off, business as usual. And it showed.
You’ve done it before, and before that and before that. A dozen or a hundred or perhaps a thousand times before. The typical meeting, with everyone in their typical roles. Often, people even sit in the same spot.
Why are we surprised, then, when the outcome is usually the same as well?
Instead of approaching that moment as JAM, maybe there’s a different way. Instead of focusing on how similar this time is to last time, instead of realizing that the similiarities demand similar approaches, maybe, just maybe, the team could focus on the differences. How is this opportunity different? What could we try that might have a radically better outcome?

Blow up your home page,"Do you really need a home page? Does the web respect it?
Human beings don’t have home pages. People make judgments about you in a thousand different ways. By what they hear from others, by the way they experience you, and on and on. Companies may have a website, but they don’t have a home page in terms of the way people experience them.
The problem with home page thinking is that it’s a crutch. There’s nothing wrong with an index, nothing wrong with a page for newbies, nothing wrong with a place that makes a first impression when you get the chance to control that encounter. But it’s not your ‘home’. It’s not what the surfer/user wants, and when it doesn’t match, they flee.

"Sharp, not a spoon","Here’s a great riff fromDerek:
Imagine the world’s attention as a big foggy cloud.  So thick you could cut it with a knife.
You want to cut through that foggy cloud, to call attention to your music.
Only problem is, if you’re well-rounded, you can’t cut through anything.  You need to be sharp as a knife.  Sharply defined.
Example: Your name is Mary and you put out an album called “My Songs”, and the cover is a picture of your face.  The music is good quality, songs about your life, and when people ask what kind of music you do, you say “Oh, everything. All styles.”.  You send the album out to be reviewed and nothing much happens. Doors aren’t opening.
Imagine instead: Your name is Mary and you write 9 songs about food. You put out an album called “Sushi, Souffle, and Seven Other Songs about Food”.  Maybe you recorded your vocals in the kitchen.  Maybe you quit cooking school to be a musician.  Yes it’s a silly example, you see how this would be MUCH easier to promote.
You may be thinking, “But I have so much to offer the world, I can’t just limit myself like that!”  If you want to increase your chances of the world hearing your music at all, though, strongly consider stretching-out your musicial offerings to the world, and keeping each album focused clearly on one aspect of your music.
Notice the long careers of David Bowie, Madonna, Miles Davis, Paul Simon, and Elvis Costello to name a few.  Each went through sharply-defined phases, treating each album as a project with a defined mission.
Here’s some top-sellers at CD Baby:Eileen Quinn.  She’s a full-time sailor. She writes songs about sailing.  That’s it.  Five albums of them.  And sailors LOVE it.  She gets written-up in sailing magazines all the time.Rondellus.  Sabbatum.

American soldiers in Iraq wrote and recorded an album in their barracks on a cheap computer with a $100 mic, about what it’s like to be over there at war.
Each of these albums got a LOT of press and a lot of sales, because they were sharply-defined, newsworthy, interesting to write about, easy to tell friends about.","May 17, 2007","musical focus, marketing strategy, defined themes"
Jidoka,"The punchline of the Dip book is that it’s not about quitting at all. It’s about mastery. Hal has agreat blogabout production thinking. He taught me the phrase Jidoka, which describes part of how Toyota creates mastery and high quality. I’ll quote something he sent me:
[Toyota calls] stop and fix the problem “jidoka”.  It’s a process where people are asked to identify every instance where the situation doesn’t match the expectation.  They do that by “pulling the cord” to activate an “andon” — a signal.  There are three signals: green (all fine), yellow (come look at this), and red (I need help).  Operators in the Georgetown, KY plant pull the cord up to 1000 times/day.  But the line only fully stops about a handful of times each day.","May 17, 2007","Jidoka, Toyota, Mastery"

When bloggers do stuff,"In the old days, authors wrote. Other people did the marketing, and that was all there was to it.
Now, of course, most blogs are one-person operations. Which means that successful blogs are often run by restless, outward-bound people in a hurry. And a lot of bloggers either have day jobs or passionate sidelines. I think that’s a good thing, even when they fail. It’s frustrating for me to hear, “stick to your blogging,” when people criticize a project created by a blogger–because it’s part of the blogging, part of the learning, part of what’s unfolding. I’d rather read a book that’s informed by the activities (not the reporting) of the writer, and I’d rather read a blog that’s based on the successes (and failures) of the blogger.
Which brings us to Hugh Macleod and hisworkfor Microsoft. Some critics think he’s selling out. I don’t. I think he’s having a huge impact on an organization–from the outside–at the same time that he demonstrates how just about any large organization can rethink its role in the world. And he’s doing it in front of all of us, without a net.
Which brings us to Guy Kawasaki and his newproject.  I disliked this project from the very first moment I saw the beta. It’s unlikely that it will fail. It will almost certainly generate a lot of traffic and a huge ROI for Guy. For the rest of us, it demonstrates just how easy it is to start a web company today, and just how important it is to create one that makes the world better, not just noisier.",,"blogging, entrepreneurship, impact"
Yes!,"So, how to overcome those that have a reflex to say no?
One way is to flood the zone with people who are likely to say yes.
Unless you’re selling to just about everyone in the world, this is far easier than trying to persuade the nay sayers.
My school realizes this. They hold the spring concert the same night at the budget vote. 200 parents at a concert are only a few steps away from the voting booth in the gym. Starbucks realizes the same thing when they put their stores directly in the path of yuppies who like spending $4 for a cup of coffee. You don’t find many Starbucks at bus stations.
Instead of focusing on arguing with people who say no, it might be easier to get near the people who like to say yes.","May 16, 2007","persuasion, yes, strategy"

How to be a great receptionist,"Being a pretty good receptionist is easy. You’re basically a low-tech security guard in nice clothes. Sit at the desk and make sure that visitors don’t steal the furniture or go behind the magic door unescorted.
But what if you wanted to be a great receptionist?
I’d start with understanding that in addition to keeping unescorted guests away from the magic door, a receptionist can have a huge impact on the marketing of an organization. If someone is visiting your office, they’ve come for a reason. To sell something, to buy something, to interview or be interviewed. No matter what, there’s some sort of negotiation involved. If the receptionist can change the mindset of the guest, good things happen (or, if it goes poorly, bad things).
Think the job acceptance rate goes up if the first impression is a memorable one? Think the tax auditor might be a little more friendly if her greeting was cheerful?
So, a great receptionist starts by acting like Vice President, Reception. I’d argue for a small budget to be spent on a bowl of M&Ms or the occasional Heath Bar for a grumpy visitor. If you wanted to be really amazing, how about baking a batch of cookies every few days? I’d ask the entire organization for updates as to who is coming in each day… “Welcome Mr. Mitchell. How was your flight in from Tucson?”
Is there a TV in reception? Why not hook up some old Three Stooges DVDs?
Why do I need to ask where to find the men’s room? Perhaps you could have a little sign.
And in the downtime between visitors, what a great chance to surf the web for recent positive news about your company. You can print it out in a little binder that I can read while I’m waiting. Or consider the idea of creating a collage of local organizations your fellow employees have helped with their volunteer work.
One amazing receptionist I met specialized in giving sotto voce commentary on the person you were going to meet. She’d tell you inside dope that would make you feel prepared before you walked in. “Did you know that Don had a new grandchild enter the family last week? She’s adorable. Her name is Betty.”
In addition to greeting guests, internal marketing can be a focus as well. Every single employee who passes your desk on the way in can learn something about a fellow worker–if you’re willing to spend the time to do it, they’ll spend the time to read it.
Either that, or you could just work on being grumpy and barking, “name and ID please.”",,"receptionist, first impression, customer experience"
Trusted Ears,"Do you ever ask for advice? Do you try out your new ideas on people before they are seen by the public? Probably.
My experience is that the world is divided into several groups when it comes to critiques:
One group likes everything. Tell someone an idea and she’ll love it. This could be because she has such esteem for you, or it could be because it’s easier than being critical.
Another group hates everything. These folks have discovered that if you are harshly critical early on in a process, it means you won’t be responsible for failure of the idea later.
A third group eggs you on. These are the people who push you to make it sharper, more remarkable and, yes, riskier.
The last group pushes you to tone it down. To go ahead, but carefully. To round off the edges.
Yes, there are people who are able to jump from group to group, who have unpredictable insights. I know one person who is unpredictable… except for the fact that she is always 100% wrong about my ideas (if she likes it, we’ve got trouble).

Why people love bestseller lists,".Bestseller lists are everywhere, mostly because they work.
They work because deep down, many people want to do what other people are doing. Things are popular because they’re popular. Hits sound better.
It’s a Catch-22 of course (you can’t be a hit until you’re a hit). If you’re in an industry with no bestseller list, do your best to create one.

No exceptions,"Leaving aside the obvious contradiction of strategy (laptop users are more likely to buy books and less likely to steal stuff, so why not let them in the store and offer them a mesh bag to carry about), this sign highlights one of the silliest (and common) policy rules: no exceptions.
No exceptions? Really?
If I gave you a million dollars could you make an exception?
And on top of the unreality of the idea, consider the message it sends to the consumer. “We’re so busy and so centralized and so hierarchical that you shouldn’t even bother to discuss this with our staff.” Or, the short version, “go away.”
Why not try a sign that says,
WELCOME!To keep costs down, we require anyone carrying a bag bigger than this square to check it. Our check area is run by Ralph, who is kind and honest, but I hope you can understand that we can’t be responsible for any items you might want to check.

How to misuse Google Analytics,"You may very well already haveGoogle Analyticsinstalled. It’s free, it’s accurate and it’s cool. Google lets anyone with a website measure their traffic and dozens of other metrics. The entire dashboard is focused on how many people come to your site, how many pages they view when they get there and how long they stay.
Given our desire to be popular combined with Google’s desire to give users what they want, it’s not surprising that traffic is the key driver of the program.
But traffic is a red herring. At best, it’s distracting, a stand-in for something more useful. At worst, though, it’s dangerous, because the quest for traffic causes you to make bad decisions.
Why do you have a site? What’s your goal? Is it to sell something? To receive email? To spread an idea? Whatever it is, you can probably measure it. And measure it you should. Every other piece of Analytics data is trivial compared to that one number.
Short version: if you don’t understand how to do goal tracking and funnel analysis, don’t use Analytics until you do.
Google offers Analytics for a reason. They’re not being selfless… they understand that efficient websites are more likely to buy traffic, because those sites can more easily convert traffic into revenue. The purpose of the program, then, isn’t to stroke your ego (or make you feel inadequate). Instead, it’s a tool to help you redesign your site every single day to make your ultimate efficiency go up.","May 10, 2007","Google Analytics, traffic measurement, goal tracking"

Absentee Ballots,"Very few people vote by absentee ballot (though the number goes up every year). This is interesting because it’s usually easier, more convenient and more certain. It’s free and it works. If you’re going to vote, why wait until the last minute?
Because, I think, people like the idea of COD. They like the certainty of getting something right now in exchange for their effort. They want to know that nothing in the world changed between the day they would have had to send in their ballot and the day of the election.
This leads to two opportunities for most marketers. The first is that you could slice off the portion of the market that likes to order in advance (in a market where that’s not really available). So you could sell your product or service long ahead of time and offer a discount or certainty that appeals to this group. Or, you could do the opposite. You could find a product (like Girl Scout Cookies) that are only offered ahead of time and figure out how to sell them in a retail fashion, like at the reception desk at work. Buy a bunch on spec and sell em when they come in.

The New York Times Effect,"Last Wednesday, the Times ran an article (okay, it was more of a puff piece) about a new gelato shop in New York. (It hadn’t even opened yet). This little shop, called Grom, was the first US outpost of a successful chain in Italy.
I took a few friends on Saturday night, which was opening day. There were more than 50 people waiting in line on the sidewalk. It had been that way all day. While we were waiting, they completely ran out of product. All gone.
Gluttons for punishment and always eager to do research for my valued readers, we went back Sunday afternoon. Another 40 people in line.
Is Grom a purple cow? Or was it a combination of perfect weather, the perfect street, the perfect time of day and the best buzz rollout ever? If they’re busy in February, it means they’ve got more than just buzz.
Which brings us to the Fugees, a refugee soccer team in Georgia. These are kids who were lucky enough to find a wonderful coach… it’s a great story. The team got a write up in the Times a few months ago. Which led to a book deal, and a movie deal and a guarantee of more than $2,000,000 for the movie alone. That’ll put a lot of kids through college.
There’s no denying th power of this effect. The real question is this: can you count on it? Plan on it? Scale it?

Starbucks and their first Dip,"I visited the world’s first Starbucks today (there are more than 12,000 of them now). It’s a little surreal, because you can see the original elements still poking out from under the splashy current veneer. The best part of the visit, though, wasn’t the really cool people that worked there… it was seeing the stores that are just down the street. There were two or three other coffee shops, a juice bar, a french bakery, a scone shop and a pierogie stand. Any one of them (well, except for maybe the pierogies) could have become Starbucks. But didn’t.
Why?
Because of the Dip. Howard Schultz took a really good (but my no means unique) coffee shop and pushed it through a Dip that got it to 100 stores. That Dip eludes almost every small businessperson. It’s too scary. The end of the tunnel is just a little bit too far away, a little too intimidating. So most people don’t try.
This intimidation is exactly why getting through the Dip is so valuable. Starbucks succeeds largely because they’re Starbucks. Ubiquity is their friend. If everyone could be ubiquitous, it wouldn’t be worth anything at all.",,"Starbucks, Dip, small business"

Longer and shorter,"Content is getting shorter. Much shorter. Call it snack culture if you want. (Josh sends us this one.Of course it’s fake.)
At the same time, advertisers are tempted to get shorter as well. To run shorter pre-rolls and shorter ads and pay to get their jelly-bean-sized logos in the corner of the screen.
I think the answer is to do the opposite. To make loooonger ads (put em on YouTube, they’re free).
I heard an argument about the Presidential debate from last week. 90 minutes for ten people. Impossible!
Why not start the Debate Channel? 20 hours a week of live debate available online. Get a cable network to run three or four hours of highlights every week as an inducement to the candidates, but it will really be about the Net. If a candidate doesn’t show up, the others get more time to talk. Use a chess clock to be sure no one bullies the conversation.
A huge portion of our lives (as marketers, as consumers, as voters, as citizens) has been dominated by the fact that there were three or twenty TV networks. That this was a scarce resource. It’s not. Not any more. So, if there’s unlimited real estate, what are we going to build?

So, since the only people who are going to watch your commercial are the people who WANT to watch it, might as well give them something at least as long as they want to watch…]",,"snack culture, longer ads, online debate"

Last opportunity for Dip public speaking tour,"We begin to close the reservations for my US speaking gigs this week. Every attendee gets 5 free copies of my new hardcover and the ticket price is $50. I’ll be speaking about mynew bookfor about 40 minutes and then taking questions and having a discussion with the audience for up to an hour or so.
The cities: Philly, Tempe, Salt Lake, Silicon Valley, New York and Chicago.The details are right here.

See you there.",,"Dip public speaking, book tour, event details"
The magic of auctions,"In many auctions, the most irrational person wins.
Here’s the proof: eBay offers a service where you can enter your maximum bid. Say you’re bidding on a signed Derek Jeter baseball bat. You decide that the most you’d ever be willing to pay for this bat, under any circumstances, is $99. Type it in.
The auction may be at only $15, and eBay will automatically bid $16 for you. If someone else outbids you, eBay keeps increasing your bid automatically, but never exceeds your maximum.
A rational purchaser sees this as a no-lose proposition. If no one else bids more than $80, you get it for much less than you were prepared to pay. If someone else is willing to bid $100, you lose, but that’s okay, because you determined ahead of time that it was only worth $99. If it goes for a hundred bucks, no big deal… it’s like seeing a diamond ring for a million dollars. You’d like it but you’re not willing to pay for it.
The price someone in Texas is willing to pay shouldn’t have anything to do with what you think something is worth, should it?
The thing is, very few people who win auctions on eBay use this feature. It’s human nature to want to keep what you’ve got, to want to avoid losing. Even a ten-year-old gets incensed when he discovers he’s been outbid.
That’s why so many auctions are active at the last minute. Auctions don’t work in a rational way.
When you bid $16 for that bat on the first day, you feel terrific. I mean, you just bough a $99 bat for $16.
Of course, you’re only the high bidder for a day or so. Then it’s not your bat anymore!Someone else has your bat.So you bid $4 more. It’s okay, you tell yourself, because, hey, you only spent $4 to get your bat back.
And this keeps going and going until you’ve spent $200.
A friend of mine spent almost a thousand dollars on a piece of furniture worth $20 using this tortured logic. Human beings are quite willing to repeatedly spend small amounts of money to avoid losing something that they think already belongs to them.
Last thought: the only thing worse than losing a big-time auction is winning one. If you win, you feel like a chump because everyone else in the world dropped out before you. Which is why, if you ever sell something big at auction, you need to bend over backwards to pleasantly surprise the purchaser. It’s the only way to overcome auction-buyer’s remorse.
Bonus lesson: If you can sell a trial version of the product or service you offer for a small amount of money, do it. (Not ‘free’, though, cause that’ll ruin it). Once someone tries the trial–assuming they like it–then future purchases are easier to justify, because all they’re doing is paying a bit extra to keep the item from disappearing…","May 5, 2007","auctions, bidding psychology, buyer's remorse"

Thinking about Yahoo and Microsoft,"So, the Net is abuzz with news that after years of flirting, Microsoft is serious about buying Yahoo. Most of the pundits are busy talking about strategic fit or Google or overlaps or asset valuation.
The real point, I think, is people.
The best things to ever come out of Yahoo, as far as I’m concerned, have been the work of individuals. Not of some hyperbolic purple and yellow machine, but from people, strong-willed individuals willing to buck the bureaucracy. And all the worst stuff the company has done has come out of committees. If Microsoft buys Yahoo, a huge (huge) number of talented people will be even richer than before and will almost certainly walk away.
What we haven’t figured out how to predict yet iswhichpeople will perform breakthroughs, which people are the ones that will change everything. What we do know for sure is that some organizations are more hospitable to that sort of behavior than others. Microsoft has gotten good at developing pockets of this sort of innovation. The challenge of an acquisition is going to be: Can the combined company make it a lot more likely that mavericks actually bring great stuff to market?",,"Microsoft, Yahoo, Innovation"

Reaching the unreachable,"Marketing, I think, can be divided into two eras.
The first, the biggest, the baddest and the most impressive was the era in which marketers were able to reach the unreachable. Ads could be used to interrupt people who weren’t intending to hear from you. PR could be used to get a story to show up on Oprah or in the paper, reaching people who weren’t seeking you out.
Sure, there were exceptions to this model (the Yellow Pages and the classifieds, for example), but generally speaking, the biggest wins for a marketer happened in this arena.
We’re watching it die.
The latest is thehand-wringingabout the loss of the book review sections from major newspapers. Book publicists love these, because it’s a way of putting your book in front of people who weren’t looking for it. Oprah is a superstar because she has the power (the right? the expectation?) of regularly putting new ideas in front of people who weren’t looking for that particular thing.
Super Bowl ads? Another example of spending big money to reach the unreachable. This is almost irresistible to marketers.
Notice thealmost.
In the last few years, this model is being replaced. Call it permission if you want, or turning the world into the Yellow Pages. The web is astonishingly bad at reaching the unreachable. Years ago, the home page banner at Yahoo was the hottest property on the web. That’s because lazy marketers could buy it and reach everyone.
Thanks to the Long Tail and to competition and to a billion websites and to busy schedules and selfish consumers, the unreachable are now truly unreachable.
If I want a book review, I’ll go read one. If I want to learn about turntables, I’ll go do that. Mass is still seductive, but mass is now so expensive, marketers are balking at buying it (notice how thin Time Magazine is these days? Nothing compared to Gourmet.)
And yet. And yet marketers still start every meeting and every memo with ideas about how to reach the unreachable. It’s not in our nature to do what actually works: start making products, services and stories that appeal to the reachable. Then do your best to build that group ever larger. Not by yelling at them, but by serving them.","May 3, 2007","Marketing, Unreachable Audience, Permission Marketing"

Was the DaVinci Code any good?,"Depends on what you mean by good.
If you read a lot of literary fiction, probably not. If you read a lot of thrillers, even then, probably not the best you’ve ever read. But if you are a marketer measuring return on investment, then sure, it was better than good. It was fantastic. One of the bestselling books of the last twenty years…
The Dip that Dan Brown got through had not a lot to do with some objective measure of the quality of his work and everything to do with good fortune, hard work, excellent timing and the power of the right ideavirus. The short version: The DaVinci Code was popular because it was popular.
The last 75% of its sales were made to people who never ever buy books. They bought it because ‘everyone else was buying it.’
I don’t believe that this is a Dip you can easily seek out or set yourself up for. But I think it’s a fascinating lesson in the power of being the best in the world. There is a pot of gold at the end of most rainbows, except most people never get there. The mistake, of course, is to believe that following the path of the person that went before is the way to get through this Dip. It doesn’t work that way when it comes to culture. Just like old jokes, what worked yesterday probably isn’t going to work tomorrow.
Pop hits work precisely because they are hits. And marketers can work hard to create an environment where the book or movie or song or restaurant they create moves through the most challenging part of the Dip… the gulf between the organic, natural audience for a product and the much bigger, hyper-excited pop audience.",,"DaVinci Code, popularity, marketing"
Do business books work?,"Every year, more than a thousand new ‘business’ books get published in the US. Not textbooks or manuals, but general interest books about how to do business better.
Some sell a few hundred copies. Some sell a few hundred thousand. One or two might sell a million. Out of a potential audience of 30 or 40 million white collar workers in the US.
Do they work or are they an utter waste of time?
I’ll admit to being biased (wow), but my mail is an interesting barometer. Here’s a self-selected group of people, a fairly large one, fortunately, that takes the time to write in and tell me what helped and how. Not only do my books seem to help, but the general consensus from this group is that many different books from many different authors help. There are plenty of clunkers, lots of dramatically overwritten brochures masquerading as books. But mixed in with the drek are books that change everything.
If we’re going to be honest about it, we should agree that the best business books are either useless (in which case rational business people should avoid them) or they’re useful.
So here’s my real question:
If you went to a doctor who told you that she hadn’t read a scholarly article or taken any training since med school, would you stick around? What about a lawyer who doesn’t read law journals or a dentist who never bothered to read up on the newest case studies?
Never mind the professions. What about the machine shop down the street? Think the $18 an hour machine operator is supposed to read the manual that came with the new machine? Who cares if he doesn’t like to read?
Why does our bizarre national fear of reading have anything to do with this? We read stuff all the time (email, stop signs, the comics) but for some reason, people think it’s fine to draw the line at books. (Typical annual per capita purchase rate for hardcover books in the US:one).
True story: I was doing a speech for a bunch of twenty-something campus reps for a clothing company. One young lady raised her hand. She pointed toPurple Cow(about 160 pages long) and said, ""If we only have time to read twenty pages, which twenty pages should we read?""
Fortune 1,000 companies have literally hundreds (or thousands) of salespeople. Why aren’t each of these salespeoplerequiredto read the latest sales book fromJeffrey Gitomer? Compared to the cost of training, it’s almost free. Compared to the cost of not doing anything, it’s a bargain.
Can you imagine web designers who proudly proclaim that they never read up on Ruby on Rails or metatags? So how come so many marketers are comfortable announcing that they’ve never read anything byGuy?

Marketing Fear,"Marketing with fear is a powerful tool. Fear is a universal emotion, it’s viral and people will go to great lengths to make it go away.
Some items can’t be marketed without fear. Seat belts, for example. They’re not convenient, good tasting, fun to use or profitable. Fear works great in this case.
An essential question to ask, though, iswho benefits?In the case of seat belts, the use of fear directly benefits the prospect, because using seat belts not only decreases fear (peace of mind) but improves safety. It gets a little dicier if you’re selling a placebo–increasing peace of mind without increasing safety (a $30 warranty at the cash register for a $16 item is not a smart financial investment, though it may help you sleep better.)
What if the marketer not only doesn’t create peace of mind, but intentionally destroys it for his own benefit? Sometimes, fear is used as a marketing tactic even if it doesn’t benefit the prospect at all. That’s because news organizations like CNN and various organizations and politicians can benefit.Craigsends us this photo of a convenience store hoping that fear will sell some duct tape.

Most and least,"Traveling yesterday, I realized that there are two popular strategies for service delivery. One is a coping strategy and one is a marketing strategy.
You can deliver the lowest permitted amount, or you can work to create the most remarkable experience you can imagine.
Stop for a second before jumping to the conclusion that the latter is always what you do.
When I pay a bill, I don’t put more money in the envelope than I’m billed for. And I don’t put more stamps on the envelope than the USPS requires, even if I’m in a particularly generous mood. Living life like Spinal Tap (always at 11) is inefficient if not impossible. Very often, we find ourselves doing the least amount of work permitted because, after all, we have more important things to spend our time on.
Smart marketers understand two things. The first is that you must pick your battles, deciding in which areas ‘most’ matters and living with ‘least’ the rest of the time. The second contradicts that and makes this a lot more complex: Least spreads.
You’ve seen this in countless organizations. A few people get in the habit of least, then a whole department does, and the next thing you know, it’s an entire airline.Least is contagious.
Really smart marketers understand this: the best way to fight the contagion is to pay what it costs to eliminate least everywhere you look. It’s ridiculous to expect most in all things (your postage bill will get out of hand), but I think it”s possible to work to stamp out least.","June 29, 2007","service delivery, marketing strategy, efficiency"
The Verizon guy who turned down the iPhone,"Given the mass hysteria, it’s probably not so good to be Denny Strigl this week. He’s the COO at Verizon quoted with pride about turning down the iPhone deal (Verizon turned down iPhone’s advances.)
The reason you need to care about this: Almost everyone is like Denny.
Most innovative business people who dream of bizdev imagine that they can be just like Steve Jobs. Come up with a super idea, a useful service, a great gizmo and go to an industry leader. Sign lots of NDAs and go to lots of meetings. Demand that they change their ways in order to make your wonderful innovation a game changer, something that will fix their broken industry and make you both a lot of money.
Hey, Steve Jobs himself couldn’t do it at Verizon. The list of big companies that didn’t jump on game changing ideas is huge. Almost as long as the list of great companies you didn’t buy stock in when you had the chance.
The iPhone/AT&T deal is almost certainly the exception that proves Godin’s law of bizdev:Nois the default answer.The spreadsheets and the marketing team and the CFO and the lawyers have no trouble at all defending the status quo, because, it’stheirstatus quo. They created it and they like it that way. Bizdev deals like this almost always fail because the potential for upside seems too small compared to the mammoth disruption that organizations imagine will beset them.

"Positives, not negatives","Doug points us to:Verizon to prospective iPhone buyers: ‘Stay near a plug’.
It’s basically a memo designed to help Verizon reps denigrate the iPhone. I think this is bad marketing. If someone is going to switch carriers and you’ve done your best to denigrate their choice, you’ve not only lost a customer, you’ve also lost credibility and respect going forward. (Because your criticism of the phone is also criticism of my judgment.)
What I’d try instead? How about this:
""The iPhone will cost $500, plus a new battery next year, plus $50 a month. If you spent that money with Verizon, you could have x, y and z…""
Then I’d spend the rest of the conversation selling x, y and z. I’d talk about a superfast network and a more reliable coverage area and all the cool gimmicks and features in the phone I can buy for $350…  (Remember, before now, all you could talk about was cheap phones, not great ones. Apple raises the ceiling).
The iPhone is a gift for every cell phone marketer in the world. Why? Because it creates a problem where there was none before. Now, a cell phone is not just a phone. Now, a phone is worth spending money on. So, since Apple created that ‘problem’ in my mind, how are you going to solve it?","June 27, 2007","iPhone, marketing, Verizon"
How to make a million dollars,"One popular method is to make a dollar in profit from each of a million people. Or a penny from a hundred million. This is the China strategy. It almost never works.
It almost never works because the challenge of reaching that many people is just too great. It’s too risky and too expensive. Doesn’t matter that you’re only hoping for a dollar or a penny. The price isn’t the challenge, it’s the difficulty in spreading your idea.
Far easier to make a thousand dollars from each of a thousand people, or even $10,000 from a hundred organizations. You can focus on a small hive of people, a group that talks to itself. You can push through a smaller dip and reach a level of recommendation and dominance that makes incremental sales far easier.
And you can learn much earlier in the process if you’ve gotten it right or not. Because you’re making more per sale, you can spend the time necessary to figure out what really sells and modify your offering sooner in the process.
The irony is that many products and services that have reached huge masses of people actually have significant margins (Windows, for example, or a cup of Starbucks). They got the best of both worlds because first they focused on winning small communities over and that led to the larger market.","June 26, 2007","million dollars, marketing strategy, community focus"

Selling advertising,"WendaHarris Millard is leaving Yahoo. That’s as good as an excuse as any to talk about what it means to sell advertising to big advertisers.
Sooner or later, just about every media plan (especially those online) includes the line, ""and we’ll sell advertising."" More often than not, this is a pipe dream. Here’s why:
There are two kinds of advertising and this leads to two kinds of ad sales.
The first kind is the rational kind. Yellow Page ads, direct mail and Google AdWords fit into this category. This is advertising that works, if ‘works’ is defined as, ""pay $3 and make $4."" With measurable direct advertising, you can count on profit-minded small organizations to give it a try (small buys) and if it obviously makes money, to buy some more. While it helps to have a salesforce, it’s not essential (if the ads are really and truly money makers). Most media companies end up with this sort of advertising, and most of them fail, because the advertising just isn’t effective enough to be this obviously profitable.
[Most advertising takes skill to turn a profit, and most advertisers don’t have any. So, there are people who make a profit with AdWords or with Squidoo offers, but not everyone. It’s just too hard to build a medium so effective and so well-priced thatanyonewith a typewriter can turn a profit.The challenge is to have enough people make money that others are drawn to the medium and invest the energy to actually get good at it.]
The second kind of advertising is the glamorous kind, the kind that people think of when they think of the Super Bowl or Time magazine or of profitable ads that are worth selling. These are the ads that built Yahoo, the ads that built NBC and the ads that so many entrepreneurs and media moguls are counting on. These ads don’t sell because they work. They sell because they are sold.
Let me be fair: they work if we define ‘working’ as: pleasing the client, pleasing the agency, increasing brand goodwill, and building, over time, a groundswell of awareness and brand respect that ultimately leads to profits. A Chevrolet ad on the Super Bowl doesn’t generate 2 million dollars in profit. No way. But, perhaps, over time, $100 million worth of Chevy ads turns into a billion dollars of profit. It’s vague, it’s tricky and it’s political.
Jerry,who I used to work with, and Wenda and others understood the investment, patience, malarkey and magic that goes into selling an irrational, expensive item to people who pretend to measure but really don’t.

Fall into the Gap,"Today, I visited a Gap store for the first time in a while. We all know that they’ve been having trouble, and it was interesting to see how they’re responding.
They’re closing about50stores net this year, trying to make their business match the market. At the same time, it was pretty obvious from my visit that they’re working hard to save money on sales staff, store designers and other expenses. It took me twenty minutes to check out. In the old days, it would have been two minutes. My reading of the Dip is that nickel and diming is a dumb strategy.
They should close200or even 500 stores and keep the very best people from each store, redeploying them to their best stores. They should invest in those great stores, invest in design, in targeted marketing. In other words, instead of shrinking themselves back to greatness, they ought to avoid the nickel and diming and go back to what made them great in the first place.

Bad customer service… by design,"Most of us do customer service in one way or another. And most of us believe that customer service represents an investment and a commitment. The more you spend, the more you get. Companies that do lousy customer service are short-sighted or just plain cheap. So we say.
I don’t think it’s that simple, though.
Consider this screen shot. Possibly the single worst online customer service I have ever experienced. AT&T has online tech support (yay) in real time (super) that is totally and completelybroken.Not because they’re not spending the money, but because the committee that designed it is a few cards short of a full deck.
This is a simultaneous chat room, which means that each person in the room sees everyone else’s questions getting answered (not useful.) Which means that it’s unthreaded, so it’s in no particular order (less useful). Worse, there’s a 10 minute wait time after you type in your question before it gets answered. And the reps spend a lot of time waiting for people to respond, and only answer one question at a time.
The result is a traffic jam that satisfies no one.
For less money, in less time, with less software hassle, they could have used any of a number of free or nearly free systems that would be fast, pleasant and efficient. You and I could fix this system in an afternoon.

Trade show tactics,"Meganand I just got back from eBay Live. Our goal as an exhibitor was to get the 10,000 attendees talking about Squidoo. And my guess is that your goal as a trade show exhibitor is to do the same thing (no, not to talk about Squidoo, to talk aboutyou,of course).
Here’s what we did: we printed 600 t-shirts with a long, hand-written letter on the front, explaining how Squidoo helps eBayers. And we gave the shirt away to anyone willing to wear it. The incentive? Each day, Megan picked someone who was wearing the shirt and gave that person $9,000 worth of ads on Squidoo.
Within an hour, you saw orange t-shirts on the show floor. By the second day, every single t-shirt was taken and more than 5% of all the people there were wearing the shirts.
Total cost: $3,000. (plus the ads).
This obviously doesn’t work at every trade show. You need both an audience that’s into playful promotionanda suitable and appropriate prize to reward the t-shirt wearer. Since this was self-referential (Having people build Squidoo pages about you is a lot like getting them to wear a t-shirt about you) it was easy for us to do, but it occurs to me that there are much broader applications of this technique. Hey, it even worked for radio stations all the years I was growing up. Stations used to offer a cash prize if they found your car and you had the bumper sticker. And no, the station never did pick our car…
A gimmick? Of course. But a relevant one. The spreading of the idea was not just our tactic, it was the entire point. Too often, trade show exhibits seem focused on either getting rid of the people who stop by or getting their badge scanned. What a waste. The real win is to generate true buzz… people talking about you and what you do, not about your tactics. So, a magician in your booth might be fun, but if all I talk about is the magician, you’ve wasted your money.
PS The shirts were so popular that our booth was marauded. People took our sample shirts, they even took the shirt off the mannequin we brought. If you took a shirt you can part with, dropmea line. I’ll be happy to buy it from you!

MARKET DRIVEN: Lots of people claim this one, but few achieve it. Creating what the market wants. I’ll put JetBlue in this category.
MARKETING DRIVEN: Much more common. This involves creating what the marketing department wants. Like American Express.
FASHION DRIVEN: This involves changing the market to have it want what you just made. Armani, certainly, but also an art dealer at Basel.
FOUNDER DRIVEN: Idiosyncratic activity, usually by the person who’s name is on the door. I’d put Virgin in this category.
SKU DRIVEN: More titles = more success, even if it’s not true. Publishers live this model.
SUBSCRIPTION DRIVEN: How do we transform a stranger into someone who uses what we do, all the time. Intuit, certainly.
PAYCHECK DRIVEN: This is what happened to Home Depot under Bob Nardelli.
TECHNOLOGY DRIVEN: When you launch products because you can, not because they’re particularly useful. HP did this for a while.
LITIGATION DRIVEN: Lawyers with an open checkbook to bill for letters sent and actions brought. The RIAA, or any of a thousand law firms representing estates by sending out reams of mail.
COMMUNITY DRIVEN: Making decisions based on what’s best for the community you serve.Room to Readmakes my list.
TROLL DRIVEN: Growth by enragement. Engage others, say annoying things that aren’t true and bask in the attention. No examples will be given, which is the best way to deal with trolls.
MONOPOLY DRIVEN: Create a system and a standard and charge increasing tolls to travel on your roads. iTunes.
EGO DRIVEN: Just be sure you spell my name right.

Misunderstanding Steve Jobs,"In a small-minded riff on Steve, John Heilemann writes  (hat tip:paidContent.org):
“Less than two weeks from now, when the phone hits the streets, the consumerist pandemonium will likely be hysterical. Once again, Jobs may have fashioned a totemic object that will capture the culture–and cause rival CEOs to have coronary events. No one else in history has pulled of this kind of coup, as Jobs has, with four different products. The Apple II. The Mac. The iPod. The computer-animated feature film. Betting against a track record like that would be a dangerous wager. Especially when you know, deep down, that you want an iPhone. Bad..
…But Jobs has been wrong before. And if the iPhone proves a disappointment, his reputation will take a precipitous tumble: from unerring visionary to just another overreaching mogul. What’s at stake for Jobs, then, isn’t money or power–for no matter how the iPhone fares, he’ll still have both in abundance. What’s at stake is the thing that now must matter to him above all: the ending of his story.”
If you’ve never pushed the envelope of the accepted wisdom, it’s easy to misunderstand what drives Steve Jobs. I can see how someone living in a status quo world would ascribe familiar motivations to him, but it’s just not true.""The ending of his story""?Nonsense. Jobs doesn’t care about his legacy or making more money. He’s addicted to Rifting–he process of fixing problems, of leaping from one broken market to another. Why would he stop?
Iwroteabout this in Fast Company seven years ago, pre-iPod:
After the death of Walt Disney the man, something happened to WaltDisney the company. You see, Walt Disney was a three-time rifter. Hewas one of the few people who have successfully managed to find a riftin the continuum of life, to bet everything on it, and to make a profitby doing so. And he did it three times.
What’s a rift? It’s a big tear in the fabric of the rules that welive by. It’s a fundamental change in the game, one that creates abunch of new losers — and a handful of new winners.
Most people who build important businesses build them on a rift,usually one that they find by accident, and usually only once.Sometimes, after they’ve succeeded once, they fool themselves intothinking that they’re so gifted that everywhere they look, they can seea rift. But Disney was different: He really was rift gifted. After all,he did it three times.

Open Table powers through a Dip,"Open Tableis an online reservations service. It’s free to use and the restaurant pays a dollar per diner. The company has raised more than 20 million dollars to date. (originalTimesstory).
During the company’s first three years, they booked a million diners (in total). Now, they booktwo million every single month. Five years ago, they had 1,000 restaurants to choose from, now they have 7,000.
That’s what it looks like when you get through the Dip. They’re a superstar, the only choice.
How did they know it was a Dip and not a dead end? Because they were selling to an entire market, not just one restaurant (Chez Panisse still isn’t a customer). By measuring incremental progress, they could see that the corner was just ahead.
(And a Dip within a Dip–one happy client is Norma’s, a hyped breakfast restaurant in NY. Norma’s does huge business via Open Table, largely because they come up on top of the breakfast ‘bestseller’ list. Like most things that get through the Dip, they’re popular because they’re popular.)",,"Open Table, reservations service, market growth"

Responsibility,"Marketing works.
Advertising and promotion and lobbying cost money. And organizations pay for it because, by and large, it works. Not all the time, and rarely as big as people hope, but sure, you can influence the public by spending money.
Which leads to the key question:are you responsible for what you market?
Some people will tell you that the market decides. They’ll remind you that most consumers are adults, spending their own resources and doing it freely. That people have a right to buy what they want, even if what they want isn’t good for them (right now, or in the long run). That’s what living in a free country is all about, apparently.Buy what you want.
But wait.
I thought we agreed that marketing works.
If marketing works, it means that free choice isn’t quite so free. It means that marketers get to influence and amplify desires. The number of SUVs sold in the United States is a bazillion times bigger than it was in 1962. Is that because people suddenly want them, or is it because car marketers built them and marketed them?
Cigarette consumption is way down. Is that because people suddenly don’t want them any more, or is it because advertising opportunities are limited?
Others will tell you that if it’s legal, it’s fair game. If it’s legal forEdelmanto post a blog called Working Families for Wal-Mart (when it’s really working Edelman employees for Wal-Mart), then they have every right to do so. In fact, they have anobligationto their shareholders to do so. Or so they say.
I believe that every criminal, no matter how heinous the crime, deserves an attorney. I don’t believe that every product and every organization and every politician deserves world-class marketing or PR.
A neighbor was complaining that the baseball field in my town needs upkeep, and wonders why we don’t go ahead and take $100,000 from Pepsi for sponsorship of the field and a long-term contract to put vending machines on site. It doesn’t matter to him that obesity and heart disease are the number one preventable cause of death. He says that it’s a personal choice, and if we can get the money, we should.
Who’s responsible?
I was surprised at how angry I got in an email exchange with John, a reader near Detroit. I wrote, “I’m sorry if I seem like a curmudgeon, but the arrogance and  blindness of Detroit’s management really and truly annoys me. Tens of thousands of innocent workers lost their jobs while clueless overpaid  company men drove the industry into the ground for decades. These were the guys who had plenty of time to fix their problems (20 years)  but instead lobbied hard to maintain SUV subsidies and gas subsidies  and on and on. They’re sort of like cigarette companies, but with far  more side affects. They’ve let down our country, in my opinion, and just because they  are lip synching a bit now, I’m in no hurry to tell you that the problems are gone.”
And now Detroit is marketing hard in DC to fight against mileage standards again, claiming that they make the cars that people want to buy.
There are two problems with blaming the market:
The first is that the market is short sighted. Which means that in a year or two or five, when the market changes its mind and wakes up, you’re left holding the bag. By not taking responsibility for growing and nurturing the market in the right way, you get punished later.
The second is that if you poison your market, it all goes away. Not just your job, but your community too.
Let me be really clear, just in case. If you think that the world would be a better place if everyone owned a handgun, then yes, market handguns as hard as you can. If you honestly believe that kids are well served by drinking a dozen spoonfuls of sugar every morning before school, then I may believe you’re wrong, but you should go ahead and market your artificially-sweetened juice product. My point is that you have no right to market things you know are harmful or that lead to bad outcomes, regardless of how much you need that job.
Along the way, “just doing my job,” has become a mantra for blind marketers who are making short-term mistakes in order to avoid a conflict with the client or the boss. As marketing becomes every more powerful, this is just untenable. It’s unacceptable.
If you get asked to market something, you’re responsible. You’re responsible for the impacts, the costs, the side effects and the damage. You killed that kid. You poisoned that river. You led to that fight. If you can’t put your name on it, I hope you’ll walk away. If only 10% of us did that, imagine the changes. Imagine how proud you’d be of your work.

Shoestring opportunity,"TV Guidewas purchased for more than $3 billion, back when a billion dollars was a lot of money. At one point, it was worth more than ABC or NBC.
CMP, like many other trade magazine publishers, is busy consolidating, laying people off and closing magazines as they try to move to digital.

The vibe,"Have you ever been at a banquet or in a boutique or at a concert or a meeting or a company where the vibe was incredibly positive?
I think you know what I mean. A time and place where there was an overflow of positive energy. You felt surrounded by possibility, or people who believed in you, or just felt like buying (or eating, or talking) a lot.
The vibe changes everything. It’s a place you want to work, or a restaurant you want to come back to. I remember the first time I walked into Fast Company’s offices. I remember the original Legal Seafoods. And I remember, just a few weeks ago, the buzz in the lobby of the PDF conference in NY.
If vibe is so important, why does it sound flaky to worry about it? Who’s in charge of the vibe at your place? Could it be better? A lot better?

Easy. Because people aren’t consistent. Sure, you say, each of the examples above isn’t fair. They don’t match. They don’t line up.

Critics and the Dip,"Corven sends us to thisAmazing Video.

Like every other person in the audience of this video, I found his performance stirring and even moving. But I was unsettled by a few things. First, that Cord, the blogger who posted the video, felt like the singer had no confidence. I completely disagree. Bad teeth doesn’t mean no confidence. His posture on stage makes it clear that he has completely mastered his craft.
But the real takeaway for me is how small-minded, snarky and downright mean the three judges are. Even (or especially) when they are surprised by his performance, they act as if they somehow deserve to sit in judgment of him.
They don’t. Critics rarely do.

The expectation paradox,"So, people are upset because of the non-ending of the Sopranos. People are always upset when a TV show ends with a big finale, because it never meets the hype, never meets the expectations. If HBO had been quiet about it, hadn’t done the full page ads and the radio shows and the newspaper articles, it would have been fine. Expanded expectations led to big disappointment.
The paradox: if expectations hadn’t been raised, fewer viewers would have tuned in.
My main sitehas been down off and on over the last few weeks. I apologize to those of you who have been frustrated by this. My expectations ofweb.comwere fairly high–I thought that after all the years I’d been using the company they acquired, they’d do a better job. I was disappointed. We’re moving on.
I visitedwebextoday to prepare for a web conference I’m doing in a few weeks. Again, lots of high expectations (big company, lots of promotional effort) and was amazed to see a workaround about Firefox on the screen. The workaround didn’t work. I was even more amazed to discover that the version I was using doesn’t even bother to support the Mac.
I’m not one of those Mac whiners who say that everyone has to support my little boutique OS. If they had lowered expectations by clearly stating the incompatibility in the first moment, I wouldn’t have been happy, of course, but at least I wouldn’t have sat there for ten minutes, blaming myself for not understanding it.
In each case, the paradox is at work. On one hand, you want to raise expectations, because without doing that, you diminish trial. On the other hand, you want to exceed expectations, because that’s what generates word of mouth.
As word of mouth becomes an ever more important component of marketing, the scales are tipping. Undersell, overdeliver. It’s the strategy that works in the long run.
Every marketer has a choice… to make the first interaction the best of the experience, or the worst (least best).",,"expectations, disappointment, marketing strategy"
1840s democracy,"150 years ago, we had pretty much settled on all of the protocols and conventions of the American democractic system. We had figured out the steps and rules of electing a president.
Before radio, before TV.Before planes or cars.Before computers or voting machines.Before YouTube.
Since mass democracy is essentially an exercise in communication and marketing, the fact that this essential process is frozen in time is a problem.
Here’s a few why not questions:
If I ran a party and wanted to increase my chances of getting elected, I’d figure out how to turn the primary process into something that was simultaneously more interesting and more likely to lead to large numbers of my party turning out to vote in the general election. Instead, it’s almost guaranteed to do the opposite.

Coachable,"A friend is wrestling with his ability to be coached. For the coachable, ""Turn right at the light"" is seen as a helpful suggestion for someone lost in a strange town… the advice goes in, is considered and then acted upon. For someone wrestling with coaching, though, it’s like surgery. It’s painful, it has side effects and it might lead to a bad reaction.
Coaching happens all the time. Most often, it’s not from a boss or a professional coach. In fact, the best insights and advice usually come from informal or unexpected sources.
In fluid marketing and organization environments, where the world changes rapidly, coachability is a key factor in evolving and succeeding. Not because all advice is good advice. In fact, most advice is lousy advice. No, the reason coachability is so crucial is that without it, you don’t have the emotional maturity to consider whether the advice is good or not. You reject the process out of hand, and end up stuck.
Symptoms of uncoachability:
Years ago, at the great Bolshoi Ballet, auditions for the troupe were conducted among 8 year old girls. That’s because it took ten years to become great. How did the auditions work? The teachers weren’t looking for the best dancers. They were looking for the dancers who took coaching the best.

“It’s always like this”,"I visited some friends for lunch at the annual book trade show in New York last week (recognize anyone inthisphoto?). There were so many people eating lunch next to the very lame cafe at the Javits Center that we were forced to eat on the floor.

If something like this happened once a year, you’d probably be a bit forgiving. But this happens every single time the Javits Center hosts a large conference, which, of course, is exactly why the Javits Center exists… to hold large conferences.
No doubt, the poor guys who have to empty the jam-packed garbage cans curse at the short supply every day. And no doubt, the people who organize various conferences notice how few places there are to sit.The problem isn’t that they don’t know.The problem may not even be that they don’t care.

Three humps and a stick (on pricing),"I’ve been working on a video project and thinking about pricing. That led me to this chart, which is more conceptual than accurate.
Let’s go through it, starting with the stick on the left.
FREE stuff spreads. You don’t make any money from the thing you’re giving away, but you do get attention, which is worth as much, or more in many cases.
Charge even a penny, though, and the drop off is huge.
Jump over to the middle hump, the one without the question mark.
REASONABLE PRICING puts you right in the middle of the market. With reasonable pricing, you can move just a bit to the left or the right to find the sweet spot, the spot where you can balance money for promotion or shelf space or advertising against keeping your price low. Most of us are familiar with the shape of this curve in our industry. For example, hardcover books go for about $21. At $28, you have more money for co-op and ads, but sales go down a bit. At $19, you can’t promote much, but sales go up a bit.
Move a bit to the left to the first hump with a question mark.
REALLY LOW PRICING is a whole new world. That’s when something becomes cheap enough to be irresistible to someone who might not consider the category at all. This is what happens when MP3 songs go from 99 cents to 20 cents. This is what happens when you sell a hardcover book for $10. There’s no room for big promotion, at least at first, but as WalMart has shown us, you can get scale at the super low end and have plenty of profit left over to hire fancy PR firms and lobbyists and ad agencies.
The last hump, the one on the right, is usually unexplored.
REALLY HIGH PRICING is the domain of specialty markets and superstars. Elton John gets $300,000 to do a bar mitzvah. John Cleese offers training videos that cost $1000 for one DVD. This is the land of high service and extreme exclusivity.
What’s interesting about the four choices is that most organizations are only familiar with one. Ask them to try another and they freak out. They don’t even want to consider it.
I think real growth can come when you get out of your comfort hump and create a blend. Understanding how to live in multiple worlds and to balance them isn’t obvious, but the opportunities are worth it. Ben Zander’s brilliantbookcosts $10.20 at Amazon in hardcover.  Buying theDVDcosts $1495.00.
If he wanted to sell the DVD in large quantities, he’d need to price it differently and sell it in a different channel. But if he wants to work with trainers and the distributors who sell to them, he’s exactly in the center of that third hump.
Careful about the Y axis (volume). Units aren’t always the goal. (that’s why I said this chart was conceptual). FREE gets you the most units, REALLY EXPENSIVE the least. But depending on your objectives, units might not be the point.
It’s not important to know the right answer, which hump to choose, because there isn’t one. It”s essential to know the question, because there are four distinct choices, and not choosing is still choosing.","June 7, 2007","Pricing strategy, market positioning, value perception"
My web vs. The web,"Theweb has billions of pages. You’ll see so few of them over your lifetime that the percentage is almost unmeasurable.
Yourweb, on the other hand, is well-traveled and familiar to you. It’s the one you travel daily.
Facebook and sites like it are changing the world because they’re becoming, for millions of people, ""My web."" Just as it’s possible to do an entire day’s work using nothing but email, it’s now possible to live all day with your social network on Facebook. The new launch of open widgets makes that even more likely. I just discoveredztail,(which I haven’t tested) which is an automatic process to let you create and then promote your auctions via your Facebook page.
It’s not for every seller–it doesn’t help you reach strangers, it doesn’t help you teach people about who you are or what you do. But for those that are building their web around their social network, it’s an inkling of what’s to come. (hat tip toFredfor his insights on Facebook).",,"My web, social network, Facebook"
Logos,"About thirty years ago, three companies dreamed up logos that have become so powerful, I don’t even have to show you the images to get them to pop up in your head. A sneaker company paid a few hundred dollars for an abstract, upside down wave, a coffee company picked a half-naked mermaid (is there any other kind) that cost them nothing, and a computer companypicked[hired a PR firm that picked] a piece of fruit with a bite out of it.
What the images had in common: nothing. They range from abstract to woodcut to groovy. The art of picking a logo, even one for the Olympics, has almost nothing to do with taste or back story. A great logo doesn’t mean anything until the brand makes it worth something.
That’s why spending $800,000 for a logo is ridiculous. And it’s why you can’t (I don’t think I’m going out on a limb here) draw the logo of any Olympic games since 1898. The Olympics have trouble creating new logos of value because each Olympicsalreadyhas an image that sticks with people… and that’s the image of the city where the games take place. Putting an abstract picture on top of something that already has a picture doesn’t work.
[and of course, the original Olympics logo meant nothing much when they started, but now provides a great shorthand to remind us of a whole bunch of attributes (youth, sportsmanship, spirit of the games, yadda yadda) that would be very hard to visualize without it.]
The iPod didn’t need a logo, where a pair of sneakers or a cup of coffee do.
If you’re given the task of finding a logo for an organization, your first task should be to try to get someone else to do it. If you fail at that, find an abstract image that is clean and simple and carries very little meaning–until your brand adds that meaning. It’s not a popularity contest. Or a job for a committee. It’s not something where you should run it by a focus group. It’s just a placeholder, a label waiting to earn some meaning.

By creating this error (and there’s no doubt in my mind it was an accident) they called attention to the fact that seniors and 16 and 17 years olds are welcome to work there.

Building 43,"Saul Hansell writes what will certainly be the most-linked article in this week’sTimes:Inside the Black Box.
The big takeaway for me is that there are [x] number of people, where x is a large number, working in a secret building at Google constantly changing the algorithms that they use to rank sites.
Being first in the Google rankings is more important than it ever was. And getting there is now more straightforward (but not easier) than ever.
It seems to me that in the SEO arms race, shortcuts have a shorter shelf-life than ever before. Building 43 is obsessed with them, and they outnumber whoever you might hire to beat the system. Organic success, on the other hand, is a clear path. If you want to be on the front page of matches for ""White Plains Lawyer"", then the best choice is to build a series of pages (on your site, on social sites, etc.) that give people really useful information. Not just boilerplate information you stole from a legal website, but really useful stuff about you, the local courts, the forms people need… the things you’d want to find if you were doing that search.
Once you’ve done everything you can… once you’ve built a web of information and once you’ve given the ability to do this to your best clients and your partners and colleagues, then by all means apply the best SEO thinking in the world to your efforts. Hire the best consultants and use the resources you’ve got left to be sure you’re playing by the right rules.
Betting against Building 43 doesn’t seem nearly as smart as betting on them.",,"SEO, Google Rankings, Organic Success"
Who wins?,"The recycled newspapers in Grand Central Station are kept in cages more appropriate for pythons. It is apparently against the law to reuse a paper and read an old copy.
Perhaps the newspaper folks felt that it would hurt their circulation if passalong went up. This is stupid, of course, since people willing to fish a paper out of the recycling bin aren’t your typical pay-a-dollar sort of readers.
Perhaps the janitors thought it would be too much trouble to clean up.

The Blind Squirrel Problem,"My dad likes to say, ""Even a blind squirrel finds an acorn now and then.""
The thing is, acorns are getting a lot better at hiding.
I was in the local family-owned stationery store yesterday. A young man, perhaps 18, walked in and said to the foreign-born owner, who was busy behind the counter, ""You don’t have any summer jobs, do you?"" It was clear that he had never been to the store before, and from his dress (ripped shorts, sandals) that he wasn’t too serious, either.
You can probably guess the answer. The seeker thanked him and walked out, headed across the street to more rejection at the drug store.
This squirrel can stumble all he wants, but he’s unlikely to find a job, never mind a good one.
Even a summer job is 400 or more hours of work. I wonder why he didn’t bother to invest three hours in advance, looking for a job worth doing?
Actually, marketers do precisely the same thing all the time. Until it’s imminent, an emergency, it’s not high enough on the priority list. Which means that the effort (when we finally decide to allocate the time) is greater and the results are worse.","June 1, 2007","job search, prioritization, marketing strategy"
Toxic employees,"Toxic employees are the ones that have difficulty with their co-workers, or worse, far worse, with your customers.
They make two big confusions:1. They confuse ""How can I help this prospect/customer?"" with ""How can I get rid of this person and get back to work?""
2. They confuse, ""How can I have a better day by treating this person with a great deal of respect?"" with ""Why isn’t this person treating me with the respect I deserve?""
Toxic employees are usually afraid, poorly managed and underappreciated. They can rarely be bullied into changing their behavior, often because they themselves are bullies. Managers can hire the non-toxic, re-assign the toxic and be really clear with themselves that they’re willing to pay almost any price to keep toxic employees away from everyone else. And if toxic employees appears to be a pattern, my bet is that it’s your fault, not the employees.","July 31, 2007","Toxic employees, workplace behavior, management strategies"
The marine iguana,"Marine iguanas swim. They eat stuff in shallow water, which is surprising behavior for an iguana.
How is it possible for there to be marine iguanas?
Ordinary iguanas washed onshore of some of the Galapagos Islands a few millenia ago and quicklydiscovered that eating the way they were used to wasn’t going to work, because there wasn’t anything to eat. Most of them starved to death. A few, though, were lucky enough that they could tolerate foraging around on the edge of the ocean. Over generations, iguanas with this trait thrived, while those that were born without it died out. A new species evolved.
The interesting lesson for marketers is this: if iguanas had had predators and competition while this was going on, they never would have survived. The barren nature of their marketplace gave them the time they needed to evolve (or as marketers with egos would say, ""figure out"") a strategy that worked.
Too often, marketers are drawn to the hot market. The problem with the hot market is that if you don’t get it right quickly, you get crushed. Really big ideas tend to get perfected in the Siberian outposts, the little niches that get ignored (until they get really big). It takes a lot of confidence to walk into a hyper-competitive market with something new. Quieter markets may just give you the cover you need to work out what it’s going to take to make those marketers grow.","July 30, 2007","marine iguana, market strategy, niche marketing"
Benefit of the doubt,"You’ve probably seen it. The customer who’s just waiting for you to screw up. The tour passenger who is itching for one thing to go wrong, the legal client who has a whole list of complaints just waiting for the first bill that comes in higher than it should, the boss who hovers, glee in his eye as you work to make a deadline.
In fact, if you’re human, it’s probably been you once or twice.
As a marketer, one of the most beneficial things you can do is get people to give you the benefit of the doubt before you start delivering a service or a product. Here are five brainstorms to get you started:
My favorite way to get a chance is to give one. Organizations that are a little more flexible with their customers (and grateful to them) often get a lot more flexibility in return.",,"benefit of the doubt, customer flexibility, marketing strategies"
Bobcasting (and Google Reader),"I’ve been a fan of RSS for a long time, and I’ve been just waiting for it to reach its potential. Most of the readers of this blog read it via RSS, (if you don’t,click here–more confusing than it needs to be, isn’t it?)
Here’s what’s I think has been holding back RSS: the name (initials!) and the lack of a standard way to read a feed and to add a feed. We need one button, not twenty or thirty. I think both problems have been solved by RSS inside ofGoogle Reader. (Click the link for a lens on an any easy way to get started). As the acceptance of Google Reader approaches ubiquity, marketers and managers now have the chance to take this technology to a totally new place.
Dave Winer, the pioneer of RSS, had a brilliancy about seven years ago that led to podcasting. Podcasting is just an RSS feed of music, with an easy interface (iTunes). Podcasting took off because it had the good parts of RSS without the hassles. But that’s music, not text.
I want to suggest something that takes no new technology but could have a big impact on the way you do business:Bobcasting.
I call it that because instead of reaching the masses, it’s just about reaching Bob. Or Tiasha. Or any individual or small group.
The future of online communication is micro-pockets of people getting RSS feeds in their Google Reader or on their Google home page. Amazon updates? Bobcast em to me. Fogbugz summaries for the customer service manager? Bobcast her three times a day.
Yes,Twitteris just an example of Bobcasting, but with a different interface. You only twit the people who want to hear from you, and you do it without spam filters or other noise.
What happens to your team when you have an RSS feed that can put a message or update in front of them without noise? And because the Reader separates the inputs by source, I can queue up my messages from you and read them in sequence. Compare that to the noisy disaster we call an inbox.
Facebook feels seductive, until you realize that the messages from those hundreds of friends are all sort of BlendTecked together. Yes, the spam is missing, but so is control.
With Bobcasting, I can have a feed for my Fedex packages, a feed updating me on the status of my frequent flyer miles at American, a feed from the project manager on the construction of my treehouse… anything that is primarily a one way piece of communication, anything where status updates instead of dialog are the goal.
If we are really living in a one to one future, then Bob (and our interactions with him) represent the asset we need to obsess over. Using RSS and Google Reader (and yes, there will be other, better readers to come) to do Bobcasting feels like a smart asset to build.","July 28, 2007","RSS, Bobcasting, Google Reader"
The promiscuity paradox,"Marketers of all stripes are discovering that acquiring a reputation and permission to market to people isn’t as expandable as they might hope.
A PR firm, for example, might have some terrific clients. These clients give them credibility to talk to the media. Over time, the firm gains a reputation with bloggers and other media outlets. Emails get answered, press releases get read. The clients get ink, new clients show up.
The temptation is to grow the business. To take on new clients. To do the PR magic for an ever larger group of people.
Here’s the problem: the people who most want to be your clients are the people you should least want to represent. As you promote the unpromotable, the permission you have to talk to the media doesn’t go up, it goes down. Better to be the agency that only represents bestselling authors than to be the biggest agency.
In the long run, the pickier you are, the better you do. Same thing goes for online merchants, brokers, church groups and just about anyone else who markets with permission.","July 27, 2007","promiscuity paradox, marketing reputation, client selection"

Role models,"Fifteen years ago, I used to frequent a movie theater in Yonkers, NY. It puzzled me that all the teenage girls hanging out front seemed to look alike. Similar hair, similar clothes. Who, I wondered, was their role model? If they were all going to look the same, they needed some central figure to look to for inspiration. I finally figured it out–Barbie. They were dressing like Barbie dolls.
Those same girls now dress like Paris. For now. Then it will be someone else.
You may have noticed that websites do the same thing. Here’s anoptimization‘expert’. I have no idea if the data is any good, no idea if the results are as promised–I haven’t used them. But I can tell in a heartbeat what the role model for the site designer was. The look and feel of the page don’t just influence the way I think about the offer, they completelychangethe way I think about it. That doesn’t mean it’s wrong, it just means that it’s not for me. This sort of graphic approach, like the layout of the spam I get all too often, is the Barbie of the Internet. For now.

"Permission, Junk and Spam","Since I wrotePermission Marketingin 1999, marketing has changed more than any of us could imagine. One of the biggest changes is the ubiquity of search.
The idea that people wouldseek outmarketing, ads and content the same way they sought out books is radical. The bookstore is filled with hundreds of thousands of titles, most of which I have no interest in. That’s okay, though, because books mind their own business, just waiting for someone to find them. Finding what I want isn’t particularly difficult, and if you want to write a junky book, it’s fine with me, as long as you’re willing to be responsible for what you say.
That same dynamic now drives everything from radio shows to web sites to scuba tanks. Go ahead and make what you want, as long as you stand behind it and don’t bother me. If you want to sell magnetic bracelets or put risque pictures on your website, it’s your responsibility, your choice. Want to find a website featuring donkeys, naked jugglers and various illicit acts? It’s junk, sure, but it’s out there. You just have to go find it. Junk turns into spam when you show up at my doorstep, when your noise intercepts my quiet.
The result of Google and the prevalence of search means that people are far more forgiving of things that need to be sought out, and less patient than ever with selfish marketers that insist on showing up in your face.","July 24, 2007","Permission marketing, search dynamics, junk vs. spam"

Empathy,"A flurry of unsolicited questions came in on Friday, including two ""please review my blog"" letters, and a ""please review my book"" package. (For the record, I’m totally useless at reviewing your blog, sorry.)
One person was very honest and asked, ""Is my blog boring?""
If you need to ask, you probably know the answer.
The mistake most blogs and books make:they are about the writer, not the reader.
Years ago, a friend (a former judge) wrote a thriller. It was based on a true story that actually happened to him. It was terrible. Why? The fact that it had actually happened was interesting to him, but the typical reader didn’t care at all. That’s because the typical reader didn’t know him.

Two New York marketing mysteries,"Today, in Brooklyn, I passed a woman wearing a large red t-shirt. It said, in full, ""Celebrate Life with Ketchup."" [Mystery solved! it’s a reference to Prairie Home Companion. Thanks, guys].

The last marketing mystery is a bonus more than a mystery. The iconic Pinkberry yogurt chain is racing across America as fast as it can, open places hither and yon. The front of the store features a variety of almost illegible bits of marketing froth, accompanied by exactly one image that is clear. So clear, you can read it across the street.

The longest tail,"I stopped by a garage sale today. The guy had thousands of CDs, most of them in their wrappers. $3 each. I was excited.

There were no hits, no recommendations, no ""if you like x, you’ll like y"".

Keeping a secret,"By now, the Harry Potter hype machine has told you all about the pre-shipped copies, the scanned book and the spoilers. No doubt it’ll sell a few copies, and no doubt the reported $20 million on security (not to mention fedex expense) was both useful and ineffective.
The interesting thing for me is how the Net changes what it means for something to be a secret. Five hundred year old technology (books) is just too slow for the Net. The act of printing, storing and shipping millions of books takes too long for a secret to ever be in a book again.
My solution? A hybrid. Publish the first edition of the book without the last three chapters. Take your time, save the $20 million. Every purchaser then gets access (hey, everyone gets access) to the last three chapters on launch day.
Books are souvenirs. No one is going to read Potter online, even if it’s free. Holding and owning the book, remembering when and how you got it… that’s what you’re paying for. Books are great at holding memories. They’re lousy at keeping secrets.","July 20, 2007","Harry Potter, secrets, publishing"

It would help if that person understood technology, at least well enough to know what it could do. They would need to be able to write. But they also have to be able to seduce stragglers into joining the group in the first place, so they have to be able to understand a marketplace, do outbound selling and non-electronic communications. They have to be able to balance huge amounts of inbound correspondence without making people feel left out, and they have to be able to walk the fine line between rejecting trolls and alienating the good guys.

After all, direct mail has a job to do… you send the letter and you get the sale (or you don’t.) Making it longer and more powerful and more complete are all essential tasks.
Brochures are a bit different. Brochures rarely lead to a sale. They lead to a sales call. So a brochure has to be engaging and hopefully viral. But its only job is to keep you in the running, not end in a transaction.
Email (sent with permission) has a different function. Its job is to get a response. To move a conversation forward, to help you learn a little bit about the person you’re engaging with.

Changing the future,"That’s what marketers do, after all. We spend time and money to change the role of our products and services sometime in the future (whereas salespeople try to change the now).
Changing tomorrow is really, really difficult. It’s expensive and abrupt and rarely works out for the best. Which is why the worst time to change your marketing is right after 60 Minutes calls on the phone. Tomorrow is so close, it’s probably going to go down the way it’s going to go down, regardless of what you do. Changing the future of tomorrow is tough.
Changing next week’s future is a little easier, next month is easier still. You can lay the groundwork now to change your team and your products and your story so that over time, you’re in a different place than you are now.
Changing next year, though… that’s really hard. It’s hard because a year is so far away, you can count on the world being a very different place by then.

Death of the farmer’s market,"As you may have noticed, farmer’s markets are springing up all over. The combination of organic and local is proving irresistible to many towns and consumers.
The market in my town is now twice as big as it was just last year. New vendors sell muffins, cookies, muffins, cheese, muffins, and yes, frozen risotto cakes in their own disposable plastic tray. Somewhere along the way, the farmer part got left behind.
This brings out tons of people, consumers who would rather buy a sandwich than a zucchini. It’s the normal progression of things–from the edgy early adopter who seeks purity and novelty above all things, all the way through the early majority and then the mass market. As the market grows, it gets, by definition, more average. Until, as Yogi Berra says, ""no one goes there, it’s too crowded.""

Small before big,"One of the luxuries of being in a low-cost business or in having access to capital is that you can scale quickly. You can go from one salesperson to a hundred, one store to twenty, no franchises to a thousand.
In our rush to scale, sometimes we forget something essential: if it doesn’t work when you’ve got one, it’s extremely unlikely to work when you have dozens.
If a political candidate can’t sway the audience with one speech, how will doing the speech across the district do anything but waste time?
If a direct mail letter doesn’t work when you mail it to a hundred people, it won’t work any better when you mail it to a thousand.
All a roundabout way of saying that obsessing about that tiny moment when someone decides to buy pays big dividends.

The honor system,"Just about everything in civilization works on the honor system.
No armed guards at the local grocery store, no pat down as you leave the library. Most people cross the street without fear of crazed hit and run assassins.
Great marketers are able to deliver customer service because they’re willing to give people the benefit of the doubt. They tend to take your word for it.
Of course there are bad actors. One out of a thousand people will cheat on that test or rip off that store. When LL Bean or Patagonia offers a no-questions-asked money-back guarantee, some jerks decide to buy an outfit, go on a trip and then return it all.
If you spend all your time worrying about these folks, you end up underserving the other 99% of the population. Take the write off. That’s what successful marketers do.
When we move online, though, two things happen. First, word among the black hats spreads fast. One person starts ripping you off and suddenly it’s a hundred.
Worse, the ripoffs and bad actions can scale. Sure, only one in a thousand email users is a spammer. But one spammer, aided by a computer, can send a million or more emails in a day. Suddenly, the people who violate the honor system are able to drown out the good guys.
Just like the real world, though, if you spend all your time preparing for and defending against the black hats, you’ll never accomplish anything. If you assume that every single interaction online is fraudulent until proven otherwise, people will just move on to the competition.
So, online, you’re between a rock and a hard place. The first opportunity is to treat your friends better than ever, because word of mouth online is incredibly powerful. The Net brings significant leverage–you can spread ideas farther and faster.
The temptation is to embrace only the advantages of the web and insist on eternal vigilance against the possiblity of getting ripped off. To act as if everyone online is a criminal. To assume that the moment you are generous or trusting, squadrons of bad actors will exploit your generosity. I don’t think that’s the answer. If you treat people like criminals, the good ones will leave, because people have a choice.
There’s a different path. Awareness of the potential problem helps you keep your eyes open. You can watch the trends, be aware, but still embrace the honor system. Realize that the vast majority of your customers will always want to do the right thing. Look both ways before crossing the street… but still cross.",,"honor system, customer trust, online challenges"
Treating different customers differently,"I’ve gotten a lot of email about:Sprint may cancel your service if you call customer service too often.
Apparently, about 1,000 people got this note. They weren’t delinquent in their bills, but they were calling in and complaining approximately 25 times a month.
If you’re going to be obsessed with delighting customers, it’s a lot more efficient to focus on customers that are able to be delighted. That sounds like a tautology, but it’s actually a guiding principle for successful businesses. Hire nice people and attract satisfiable, gabby customers. Why not?
These 1000 people were actually happy to be unhappy. They were unpleasable, and they weren’t helping either word of mouth or the ability of the call center folks to do good work.
I think the mistake Sprint made was in only giving people one day’s notice. I probably would have given them a month or so…Turns out Sprint even gave them one month’s notice.

Instead of having people manning terminals in high-cost Rockland, NY, you’d have 10 people answering the phones (and inputting the same data) in India. More access for less money.
I have no doubt it would create savings. I’m also pretty sure it wouldn’t add much value.
It wouldn’t add value because reducing the cost of an interaction with a consumer isn’t usually the point. The real win is when a service person does the difficult work of solving problems and the essential work of connecting with people as individuals. You can’t outsource this easily.
You’ve heard it before: every single interaction is an opportunity to do marketing, not a chance to cut costs.

Sloppy naming,"If you’ve got more than one product or service, you have a problem. You need to decide if there’s going to be an architecture to the way you name things. General Motors has a division, Chevrolet. Chevrolet makes cars, and each car has a name (Corvette, Impala). They have an architecture in place that makes some things clear very quickly.
It’s easy for the brand managers at GM to figure out the steps to go through before naming a car. It’s easy for consumers to subconsciously figure out the hierarchy of how it all fits together.
This architecture isn’t a cure-all. Sometimes it leads to internal navel gazing that prevents great stuff from happening. (I remember sitting in long meetings at Spinnaker, where I was a brand manager in the 80s, arguing about what color the little logo banner should be on a particular product–teal meant educational, but siena meant family…)
The alternative, which is to make stuff up as you go along, can lead to chaos. Check out thechartof Apple products through the ages. Apple’s sloppiness has cost them millions of dollars in legal fees and settlements, not to mention making it hard for the team to keep up with the engineers.
First,Applewas a brand that modified a noun. Apple Computer, Apple II, Apple III. ThenMacintoshwas a brand that was modified by a brand that modified a noun. Apple Macintosh computer. Then Apple Mac IIfx computer, etc.
Then Apple was a brand that modified a brand that modified no noun at all.Apple Newton.
Then Apple modified its own subbrand by adding the letter ""i"" in front of it.Apple iMac.
Then they went back to the Newton strategy, with a twist:Apple iPod.The thing is, the ""i"" in Mac modified something we knew what it was (a Mac). But what’s a ""pod""?
Wait, it gets a lot worse.
Now that Apple had two successful ""i"" products in a row, they got giddy and tried to own one of the 26 letters of the alphabet. Which you can’t do. So iHome isn’t made by Apple, butiLifeis. The more equity Apple puts into the i, the more they waste, because others can just leverage it for free and people get confused.
Apple made the same mistake with thePowerbook(a third sub brand, theApple,Macintosh,Powerbooklaptop). They had to give up the word ""Power"" when they switched to the Intel chip from the PowerPC chip. A multi-billion dollar brand name, shredded.
Apple had to pay a million dollars for iphone.com, because the brand managers didn’t see it coming years ago. Same thing with Cisco’s phone.  They even paid a million dollars for permission to use the word ‘classic’ for one of the Macs years ago. Did I mention the hassles with podcasting?
When a newer, more integrated version of the iPhone comes out, what do they call it?
My guess is that everyone waits to see what Steve likes.
It’s absolutely true to argue that a naming architecture is no replacement for amazing products that people choose to talk about. But if you’re going to pay all those lawyers and marketing suits to work on the names, they might as well be encouraged to lead, not to follow.

Expectations,"Word of mouth comes directly from expectations.
Low expectations are a terrific shortcut, because when you exceed them, people are so amazed that they can’t help but talk about it.
But low expectations are dangerous, because if you fly too low, you’re invisible. Worse, when people expect little of you, they often don’t bother listening at all.
So most of the time, you’re challenged with this: high expectations that must be beat.

Times a million,"Politicians, social-cause marketers, health product marketers and others have a particular problem that makes marketing difficult: The closer an issue is to the purchaser, the easier it is to use it with impact. People care about a fire intheirmovie theatre, a lot less about one across the country. People care about an illness that they have right now, a lot less about preventing something twenty years from now. When you create gaps in time or space, people lose interest.
There’s another factor to consider as well: the consumer will be more motivated by something that she can have a direct influence on. Sure, every little bit helps, but every little bit is really difficult to market.
I was driving on the Taconic Parkway last week and noticed a Porsche Cayenne and a Ford Edge were keeping pace with me. I was driving my Prius and getting about 51 miles per gallon. The other two cars were averaging about 20 each. Here’s an analysis I just grabbed from a random website:
Even though I drive over 35,000 miles per year, a CX-7 would only saveme about $300 per year over an Explorer Limited V8 (with regular at$2.40 and premium at $2,60). Even though the Edge will run on regular,and probably achieve a bit better mileage than the CX-7, it wouldprobably only save me about $900 per year on fuel vs the ExplorerLimited V8. For someone who drives more typical distances, the annualsavings would be less than half those amounts.
Notice the lack of ""times a million"" math.
If we figure that the average driver in the US does 20,000 miles a year, I’m going to use about 400 gallons of gas. A car getting 20 mpg is going to use closer to a thousand gallons. Figure that there are about100 millionactively driven cars in the US, which means that the net difference if ""everybody did it"" has the potential to save 60 billion gallons (600 times 100 million) of gas. A year.
No, this isn’t a pitch to switch. It’s a pitch to describe how amazingly difficult it is to market that story.
The guy above who’s not going to switch from his Explorer to an Edge because it will only save him $300 a year is clearly not going to be interested (never mind moved) in the thought experiment above. It’s too distant. Too far away.
The same as the person who buys one of the million bottles ofFijiwater sold every year. The same as the person who doesn’t want to know about a kid about to die… if the kid is thousands of miles away and it’s not clear how one person can make a difference right now. Here’s the thing: all marketers who whine about the distant do is annoy people. At least the people who don’t care about the distant. They don’t get ""times a million"" math, and repeating it with frequency isn’t going to help much.
The reason PETA has had good success railing against fur coats is that they make it personal. The same way faith healers bring an impact to a room.
The lesson of the National Lampoon cover above, the best magazine cover in history, should be obvious by now. The way to sell the distant is to make it immediate. The way to sell the drop in a bucket is to make the bucket a lot smaller, not to extrapolate to even bigger numbers. ""Buy this car and we’ll kill 10 penguins"" is a lot more powerful than ""Buy this car and forty years from now, if everyone else buys a car like this one, your grandchildren are going to spit on your grave.""","July 5, 2007","marketing, consumer behavior, immediacy"

and5. retailers who have actually done this and regularly report increases in sales of 30%.(I heard from people who sell high end clothes, hardware and bikes).
Of course this won’t work for everyone. (Of course label-centric sport shopping is here to stay). And of course it’s doable (hey, you separate the men from the women from the kids already).
The most fascinating takeaway for me is this: many retailers believe that they still have the power to inconvenience shoppers as a way of increasing revenue. ""Too many stores in that mall,"" in my opinion, for me to stay with you if it’s easier and more fun to go over there instead.

Reorganizing for profit,"Here’s what most retailers do:They organize by brand/designer or labelWithin that, they organize by type of itemand within that, by styleand finally, by size
So, all the Armani blue suits are next to each other, then by size.
So, all the boxer shorts at the Gap are on a wall, organized by style first (checks over here, stripes over there,) then by size.
So, all the power tools at Home Depot are together, sometimes by brand, sometimes by function (saw) and then by type of material to be cut (wood).
This is dumb, and the web makes it obvious why it’s dumb. It’s dumb because it makes it easier for the clerk, not for the customer. And dumb because it plays to the label’s ego, not to ours.
Does anyone say, ""okay, even though my son wears size large boxers, these striped ones are really nice, I’ll buy the small instead."" Of course not.
So why not put all the large boxers right next to each other, regardless of designer and style?
When you go to Home Depot to get what you need to build something out of wood, why don’t you find the glue and the wood saws and the screwdrivers and the screws all together in a section called, ""working with wood""?

Pushing and running,"One of the most difficult transitions that marketing organizations go through is shifting from pushing against resistance to running with acceptance.
The culture at insurgent companies is all about pushing. You get turned down on sales calls, you have tiny market share, people walk away from your trade show booths. You have trouble finding suppliers and a bank loan and even employees.
So you learn to push. In fact, you may discover you start to lean against that resistance, that it becomes part of who you and your team are.
If your work is successful, you break through. You become Apple or the politician who leads in the polls. And then what?
If you’re very good, you start running like crazy. You have the wind at your back and the chance to dramatically increase your impact and market share. But most organizations keep pushing. Because that’s what they know how to do. Instead of running up the scoreboard, they look for something else to push against. I think the fascinating transformation at Apple is worth noting. The iPod gave them the opportunity to start running.

The reason for the market failure is historic. Audio bookstraditionally generate very little revenue to the author. She gets aroyalty on a royalty on a small sales base. Not worth the time topromote. Add to that the huge hassle of keeping a large number oftitles in stock at a retailer and throw in the high price required byproducing many CDs or cassette tapes per title, and you see the problem.

How to make a PowerPoint chart,"More data does not equal more information.
Sooner or later, you’re going to be tempted to use actual data in a presentation. Powerpoint makes it easy, and it also tempts you to do it completely wrong. Here are some ideas to help.
The first question:What’s the point?
Yes, there needs to be a point. The only reason to include statistics in a slide is to advance an argument. Unless you work for the National Institute of Health, the chances that you’ll be asked to review raw data on a slide and try to figure out causation is slim indeed. (Though this is a really useful way to do research and analysis, most readers of this blog don’t get invited to meetings like that very often).
In this slide fromGarr,we see too much data, poorly presented. Does the relationship of internet connectivity via cell phone in the UK vs. France have anything to do with why we’re here? I don’t think it does. My guess is that the purpose of this slide is to persuade the viewer that an enormous percentage of those in South Korean have access. The rest of the stats are certainly nice, and they add credibility, but the details are not just irrelevant to the audience, they are actually distracting.
My version looks like this:
I’ve made an assumption–my audience is in the US. I’m trying to teach them that in South Korea, a vastly larger percentage of the market has access to the internet via their cell phone (perhaps I’m pitching a VC on a South Korean internet venture). While China and the UK offer me juicy relative stats, the audience is in the US and they are ethnocentric… they understand the state of their own market.
There are several other things going on here are that are a bit more subtle. The first is that left to right bar charts are silly. The audience takes a lot longer to ‘get’ the idea that something that extends further to the right is better. UP, on the other hand, is always better.
Second, when dealing with percentages, you need to communicate that getting closer to 100% is incrementally more difficult. In other words, 40% is not twice as good as 20%. It’s actually ten times as good if you’re talking about some sort of networked device like a fax machine. In this case, I do that by drawing a picture of a cell phone. As you can see, the closer you get to 100%, the happier your psyche is. The US phone is clearly broken, the other two are pretty close to great.
Next question:How do I make it a verb?
PowerPoint isn’t a printout. It’s a presentation. As a result, you get to create action. Instead of just showing the slide I just showed you, I’d show this slide instead. Why? Because I want to set the baseline. I’d say, ""As you probably know, about a third of all the cell phones in the US have access to the Internet. As a result, there are relatively few useful services available, and most cell phone users rarely if ever go online. It’s too slow, too clumsy and there’s not enough to do.""
Two things have happened. First, I’ve made a simple statement of fact that is easy to gut check and probably believe. It becomes your fact at that point, not mine.
The second thing I’ve done, by leaving the left side of the slide blank, is create a little itch. You’re wondering what’s on the left. You’re waiting for the punchline. THEN I show you the slide with all three countries on it, and I can say, ""When you have almost complete penetration, the entire game changes…""
And then we’re in. We’re on the same page, and you’re ready to hear my story. Remember, you don’t pay by the slide. I did a presentation yesterday… 154 slides in 54 minutes. And I didn’t even break a sweat.
Last thought and then I’ll let you go. You can also aggregate data. In fact, you’re expected to. Pie charts are a great example of how people go wrong.
Here’s a typical pie chart, showing traffic sources to a website:
It’s accurate. It shows more than a half a dozen places that traffic come from. It’s also useless. It’s ungrokable. It doesn’t have a point.
Here’s the same data, grouped to make a point. ""We get our traffic from three sources, one dominates the other two, but only one of them is under our control in terms of our ability to scale it directly. So let’s talk about how we grow that slice.""
By all means, give me the data. All of it. Just do it in a printout, and share it with us at the end of the presentation.",,"PowerPoint, data visualization, presentation tips"
Are you a who?,"Years ago, I got a piece of junk mail inviting me to be in Who’s Who.
Apparently, this used to be very exciting news. Pre-web, Who’s Who was the best way to tell if someone was connected. You went to the library and looked someone up. You could see (most important) if they were in the book, and then you could see where they went to school, who they married, what they did, what clubs they belonged to…
Wikipedia, of course, changed all that. Wikipedia knows all and tells all, and it doesn’t even try to sell you something. Wikipedia is my favorite web destination of all.
Lately, though, the folks at Wikipedia are drawing a line about who’s important enough to be inside. A good friend attempted to post her bio and was rejected, ""not notable enough.""
Ouch.
Are you notable enough? I think so.
It occurs to me that the web is redefining what notable means, and so are we. Famous used to mean Gene Kelly and Mae West, or Sandy Weil and Bill Gates. But with the long tail, notable means: you’re the #1 player on your tennis team; you’re the top of your marketing department; you’re a blogger lots of people read and talk about — you’re the best and most"" notable"" in your niche, however small.  That’s the kind of famous that SquidWho is about…
This being the web and not the real world, we decided to take matters into our own hands and launchSquidWho.The people-powered open who’s who online. If you think someone is notable enough to warrant a bio, then they are. Your call, not ours, not some invisible editor’s.

Elephant Math,"Darwin pointed out that if you take one pair of breeding elephants and make some conservative estimates about their fertility, you would have more than 15 million elephants in less than 500 years (if none of them died an early death.)*
It’s pretty clear it doesn’t work that way. Perfect viral growth, even slow viral growth, rarely happens. If it did, we’d have an elephant problem.
The same thing happens with your idea. If one person told four and the cycle repeated itself for a few generations, everyone would know about it. But they don’t. It tails off. One person often tells zero. Or people hear about it but forget.
Real viral growth comes from one of a few likely paths:
It’s possible to combine some of these tactics. When a political candidate starts out, for example, it’s almost certainly with a grassroots approach, but then, perhaps, once enthusiasm picks up, he or she shows up on TV. You can organize around this and plan for it, but you certainly can’t guarantee it.
Here’s the big news: it doesn’t matter much how many elephants you start with. In other words, big launches don’t necessarily scale. What matters is how fertile your elephants are (number of babies per generation) and how long they live. If Darwin’s elephants managed to squeeze in just one more generation, they end up with 30 million.",,"Viral Growth, Fertility, Elephants"
The Scarcity Shortage,"From four years ago:
What’s worth more: a pile of gold or a pile of salt? Throughout history, many people have chosen the salt. Gold is pretty, but you can’t live without salt, and when it was more scarce than gold, it became valuable enough to use as a currency itself. (The word ""salary"" is even related to the Latin for ""salt."")
Today, of course, salt is close to worthless. Given the choice between a pile of salt and a pile of gold, you’d go for the gold every time, because there’s less of it around.
Scarcity, it seems, has a lot to do with value.
…we’re running out of a lot of important things–clean water, free time, breathable air, the ozone layer, and honest leadership, just to name a few. At the same time, we have to worry about something that is about to affect just about every business I can think of. We’re running out of scarcity.
Scarcity, after all, is the cornerstone of our economy.The best way to make a profit is by trading in something that’s scarce.This is why the music and movie industries are so terrified by the millions of people who download entertainment from the Internet every day. Downloading threatens to make supply virtually unlimited, and that could make their offerings about as valuable as those of some kids down my street who recently tried to run a stand selling freshly made mud.
It seems as though once a category becomes successful, the headlong rush to knock it off is stronger (and quicker) than it ever was before. Last week, a woman who came to a seminar in my office was desperately searching for a way to improve her mortgage-brokerage business. I ruined her day when I suggested that she shut her company down and try something else. Twenty years ago, most mortgages were written by the local bank. Those banks planted the seeds of their obsolescence when they eliminated judgment from the writing of mortgages. Once they could automate a mortgage application, so could everyone else. So mortgage brokers used their low overhead and quick wits as an advantage and stole the business. Today, there are an infinite number of brokers to choose from, all offering essentially the same service. The result is that there is no scarcity, and no profit.
It’s not just about product knockoffs, of course. While there are almost half a million lawyers practicing in the United States today, there are (gasp!) more than 125,000 in school right now. No matter what you believe about lawyers creating ever more work for ever morelawyers,there’s no question that with so many of them, they’re hardly scarce.
The same thing is true for doctors, Web sites, T-shirt shops, sushi restaurants, thumbtack manufacturers, and brands of blank CD-ROM disks. There are 100 major brands of bottled water. Someone opened a fancy ice-cream parlor in Manhattan, and then there were six.
If it’s remotely digital (like music), then it’s easy to mimic. And if it’s easy to mimic, someone wins if they can knock off the original–the sooner the better. When someone starts to sell exactly what you sell but for half the price, how long does your good-service, first-mover, nice-person advantage last?
Zara, the fast-growing European clothing store, can knock off a new fashion before the original designer even gets it to the upscale department stores. Suddenly, the original appears to be the copy.
So how do you deal with the shortage of scarcity?
Well, the worst strategy is whining–about copyright laws and fair trade and how hard you’ve worked to get to where you are. Whining is rarely a successful response to anything. Instead, start by acknowledging that most of the profit from your business is going to disappear soon. Unless you have a significant cost advantage (like Amazon’s or Wal-Mart’s), someone with nothing to lose is going to be able to offer a similar product for less money.
So what’s scarce now? Respect. Honesty. Good judgment. Long-term relationships that lead to trust. None of these things guarantee loyalty in the face of cut-rate competition, though. So to that list I’ll add this: an insanely low-cost structure based on outsourcing everything except your company’s insight into what your customers really want to buy. If the work is boring, let someone else do it, faster and cheaper than you ever could. If your products are boring, kill them before your competition does.
Ultimately, what’s scarce is that kind of courage–which is exactly what you can bring to the market.","August 27, 2007","Scarcity, Value, Competition"
Marketing = mass psychology,"All real estate brokers working today have thrived in an environment in which the price of a house increased on a regular basis for fifty years.Fifty years.Of course, it’s not just home sellers, it’s us, too. Consumers have built their financial lives around this shared belief.
I’ve spent the last few years fretting about what just happened:Your home as a piggy bank? Not anymore.
The shared belief about real estate might be in danger. The facts changed this month for the first time. The question that those that market real estate have to answer is this: will people treat a bounce in real estate the way that they think about a drop in the stock market (a chance to profit) or will it lead to a long-term reevaluation of what it means to own a house?
It’s interesting to note that insurance on a Ferrari isn’t as expensive as you think. That’s because fixing a million dollar Ferrari doesn’t cost nearly a million dollars. It’s the serial number that you’re buying–the right to sell that car later for a profit.
If the ""serial number profit motive"" disappears from residential real estate, what happens? I think it could be bigger (and worse) than most people imagine. If the marketers in the real estate world understand the challenge they face, they may very well be able to market their (our) way out of it.

Lying to your customers,"I found myself at Home Depot on Friday. I needed several pieces of wood, cut to size.
When I noticed this sign on the big saw, I took a picture, intending to write about how important it was to have key customer service features up and running. Then, a few minutes later, a guy in an orange smock walked over, took the sign down and asked what he could cut for us.
It turns out (at this Home Depot, anyway), that whenever they don’t feel like using the saw, they pretend it’s broken. (Yes, technically, they didn’t say ‘broken,’ they said ‘not working,’ which is sort of true. Except it was the saw operator who wasn’t working.)
Sort of like the gas station that won’t let you watch them in the garage because of ""insurance regulations"". It might be a great shortcut, but it can’t possibly help in the long run.
PS notice the tag line on the sign. ""No one beats our prices, guaranteed…"" When was the last time you heard someone complain about the prices at Home Depot?

So, while a few passionate people may wish for handbags or jewelry or books or watches to be available this way, none of them are even close to matching the dynamic of Netflix.
That doesn’t mean the entrepreneurs shouldn’t try. They should. A new business model offers way more room for a new company than an existing one.

Follow through,"Why do you need to follow through so much on a tennis or golf swing? After all, the ball is long gone.
Why do you have to honor a money back guarantee with a former customer who is never going to buy from you again (and it’s six years later)?
Why do you have to reinvest and retrain an existing employee who needs some guidance when it would just be quicker and easier to hire someone new?
I think the reason is the same in all three cases. It’s not because the thing you do at the end of your swing matters. It’s because it’s a slippery slope.
If you know that the last two inches of your follow through don’t matter, then you’ll start slowing down at three inches, or even four, and suddenly it does matter. If you draw the line on money back guarantees you’ll keep sliding backwards, bit by bit, until it does matter. If you’re quick to fire the employee who needs a lot of help, you’ll be quicker with those that need just a little, and then, pretty soon, it’s a very different place to work, isn’t it?
Obsessing about the last inch of follow through ensures that the important parts of what you do get just as much (if not more) commitment.","August 23, 2007","follow through, commitment, consistency"
Authentic,"Eugene Kates died yesterday. I knew him for more than thirty years, and he was a giant.
Eugene helped invent the idea of summer camp in North America. He stood up to the government, to rangers, to staff and even to his customers, the parents. He had a clear view of the way he wanted the world to be, and he stuck with it, regardless of what the world thought.
In an age of ‘the customer is king’, Eugene was an anachronism. He never said things to make people happy, didn’t sugar coat his point of view and he didn’t compromise.He once made my parents sit on a mosquito-infested dock for an hour because they had the temerity to come visit without buying lunch at his hotel. And he fired employees (any employee) who put their own needs before safety or the environment. There was one way, and it was his way.
In an age where few people stand for anything, Eugene stood for something. He wasn’t afraid to tell you what he thought, and it didn’t take long to guess what he expected.
I often encourage you to be like this person or be like that person. I’m not sure anyone could be like Eugene, or even want to be. It’s a hard road to be that authentic, that driven, that certain. For fifty years, he made things happen. He didn’t sell every slot, didn’t make every possible fan, but he made things happen.
For a lot of people, it was easy not to like him. For everyone, it was impossible not to respect him.
I miss him already.","August 22, 2007","Eugene Kates, authenticity, summer camp"
Google book search,"Flexing their traffic muscle, Google today started including book search results at the top of search (at least on my computer.) Here’s three samples:1,2,3.
Two things to notice:
1. if you were an author or publisher and it was easy to ignore them before, it isn’t now. Google is going to do stuff like this often… being the front door to the web has its privileges. If you’re an author or publisher, time toplay ball.
2. the search results areterrible.They don’t seem to be in any order whatsoever. Not sales, not links, not relevance or date of publication.

Loss vs. Gain,"I was hunting around atnameboyyesterday and found an amazing domain that was perfect for a new project we’re working on. I grabbed it. When I got to the checkout, nameboy apologized and told me that in fact, the domain was already taken. (This is because nameboy does its magic on a cached database of available names… they’d never be able to make it work in real time).
Ouch!
My name was gone.MYname. It was mine! And now it wasn’t.
I immediately tracked down the dastardly organization that had stolen my name and offered them $600 for it. (I would never have paid $100 for this name before it was ‘mine.’) They turned me down. Not because they were doing anything with it (they weren’t, at least not yet) but because they had, in a few short days, grown accustomed to owning it, to dreaming about it, and my guess is that they wouldn’t have let it go for thousands of dollars, even though they, like me, would not have paid $100 for it at first.
People will go to great lengths to keep what they think they already have. Just watch how slow people are to volunteer to be bumped from an airplane… Same thing happened when Google recently cancelled videos that people had purchased.

Business card mistakes,"Business cards are almost quaint. After all, I can get your info into my computer a lot quicker if you’ll just email it to me.
Precisely because they are an anachronism, they serve a vitally important function. In an era where no one dresses up anymore, they give you a chance to position yourself, to represent who you are and what you do in a three cent piece of paper. And yet… almost all business cards are terrible. They are the leisure suits of the marketing the world, the place where bad design not just lives, but thrives. (Wanna guess which one of these ten cards I don’t hate?)
I think the point of your card should not be to demonstrate that you are creative. The point should be to demonstrate that you have good taste.
Here’s my checklist of common mistakes (and a few suggestions). It’s $30 well spent, I think.

The Argument,"The web is about tactics, at least most of the time. Most of the meetings and most of the effort goes into honing our tactics.
One of my concerns about the misuse of SEO by marketers is that it’s largely about tactics. It’s easy to get hooked on constant cycling of this approach or that tactic, all to incrementalize your improvements.
Big successes, on the other hand, come from arguments. Arguments about what you stand for. Arguments about big strategic shifts. Google wasn’t a tactic, it was a game-changing strategy. eBay’s tactics are often poor or slow, but their strategy has been consistently brilliant.
And brilliant strategies lead to arguments. Go have one.

"Cheap media, cheap ads","Listening to AM radio at 7 am on a Sunday is a real chore.
Even in a city like NY, the ads are virtually free. Mysteriously, when the ads are cheap (think banners, or cable or AM radio), the content is lousy.
A SuperBowl ad costs a few million dollars to run… so the beer companies and the dot com companies spend millions creating the ad, even if it runs only once. A banner ad that you can buy for $200, on the other hand, appears to be created by a small chipmunk in the secretarial pool.
There’s no economic reason for this. You can run that banner ad in a thousand places. You can run that radio ad in 200 cities. If the media is cheap, it might just be a good value. And if you can run an effective ad, you can run it far and wide and turn a profit.

If you produce materials for trade shows, it’s important to remember that just because someone is sitting in an auditorium, it doesn’t mean that their standards for entertainment, video or content have been mysteriously erased.

No business model,"I just got off the phone with Kent, who in addition to his day job doing online marketing, runspdxMindShare – Portland’s network event and emails. It’s a free local newsletter with several thousand subscribers.
Kent told me that the only purpose of the newsletter is to help connect the community… that it doesn’t have a profit motive. A quick look, though, shows that this isn’t really true. By building something that connects his community, by building a permission asset with the right people (and not asking anything in return), Kent builds his reputation. He makes it more likely that people will trust him, talk to him and hire hisfirm.In an industry in which anyone can claim to be an expert, his firm’s connections and relationships confirm that they are the real deal.
The most important part of the story is this: he doesn’t do the community work for that reason. He does it for the right reason–because it feels good to help his community. The magic of the zero-marginal-cost scalable nature of the web is that your volunteer effort goes a long way and generosity almost always pays off, even when it might feel like it doesn’t.","August 16, 2007","community, connection, reputation"
The Galapagos Post Office,"Not sure what you can do with this story, but here you go:
On a deserted beach on a small island near the equator, there’s a barrel and some ziploc bags. This post office has been here for more than a hundred years. It was built by whalers who needed a way to get letters home to England. The idea was that the last stop you would make on your way home was to the post office. You’d pick up whatever letters were there and bring them back to England.
I dropped two postcards in the barrel ten days ago (no stamps, of course). They arrived on Wednesday. I’m told some notes take as long as a month or two. Apparently, you can send a letter anywhere in the world and count on it showing up. There’s actually a shortage of mail… more people want to carry the letters then write them.
Ideas spread in funny ways. In this case, the joy of the person who helps out by delivering the note is probably greater than that of the sender. And the story is so irresistible for both parties that it can’t help but spread. By word of mouth or by blog…",,"Galapagos, Post Office, Mail"

Amazon crosses a line (and forgets to bring a gift),"I got an interesting email from Amazon today.
We noticed that you purchased an e-commerce related book in the past and we thought you might be interested in an exciting new product from Amazon Services: WebStore by Amazon.
This is the first time I can remember them cross-selling from a $20 book to a service that costs more than $700 a year. It feels a little weird. Their list of people interested in ecommerce is insanely valuable, but if they put off those very people, it becomes worthless.
The mistake continues when you go tosign up.  All the usual sign up bells and whistles are there, including a neat phone authentication tool, but there’s no promises, no feature exposition, no benefits. It’s just a rush to collect your credit card and start charging you. Other parts of the site promise a free month trial, but I couldn’t see it mentioned during the sign up. I bailed at the very last page, because it wasn’t clear to me what I was getting, why I wanted it and how much it would end up costing me.
It’s very tempting to take your permission list and expand the offerings you bring to it. New products for your customers instead of new customers for your products.

The opposite,"The opposite ofupisdown.The opposite ofinisout.
Those two are easy. They are one-dimensional.
The opposite of Steve Jobs is Bill Gates.
Sort of. That’s because Bill and Steve have a lot in common (outsize personalities, many Google matches, successful tech companies). But it’s useful to consider them as opposites because we learn a lot about their approaches, personalities, and yes, brands, by looking at the inverse.
The opposite of Starbucks is Dunkin Donuts.
Not an independent coffee shop, and not coffee at home.
On the other hand, the opposite of Dunkin Donuts is not Starbucks. The opposite is ‘not having coffee out.’
That’s because when someone considers getting their morning coffee, the choice is usually home or Dunkin. That person doesn’t have Starbucks as part of their choice set. Defining your brand in this way makes it easier to ignore the irrelevant competition and easier to figure out what you are (and aren’t).
Bill Clinton and John Edwards aren’t the opposite of Rush Limbaugh. Al Franken is.
The Blackberry isn’t the opposite of the iPhone. A plain jane Motorola phone is. Apple understands this. Blackberry doesn’t seem to.

The Encyclopedia of Business Cliches,"It’s easy to make fun of business clichés. Tempting to string a bunch together in a blog post or a memo and show how clever you are. Harder, though, to avoid using them.
I think they exist to hide. By providing a layer of insulation between what you say and the truth, you can avoid saying what you mean, avoid confrontation and avoid change. Clichés make it easy to talk without really saying anything. Clichés make it easy to hide and to lie.

Couples.Fashionistas.Women.
In fact, my guess is that more than half the people in the store were women. And they weren’t all buying iPods, that’s for sure. This is clearlythe result of an intentional multi-year strategy. Apple has succeeded in doing something that no one else in tech or even cars has done. They’ve crossed the gender barrier and made people of both genders passionate about what they sell.

Is good enough enough?,"Most marketing efforts are projects in response to problems. ""We need a box for the product launch."" ""We need a press release for the tour the boss is doing."" ""We need an ad campaign for the Super Bowl.""
In response to projects, many organizations figure out the resources they’ve got and then work hard to do something good enough. On time, within budget. Meeting spec, after all, is your job.
You end up, if you’re talented, with somethinggood enough.
Is that enough? Is good enough enough to win? To change the game? To reinvent your organization and your career? In a crowded market, when all the competition is good enough, not much happens.
Good enough is beyond reproach. It’s safe at the same time it represents quality. Good enough demonstrates effort and insight and ability. People rarely get fired for good enough, which is a shame.
If you redefined the objective to be, ""makes some people uncomfortable, changes the entire competitive landscape and is truly remarkable in that many of the key people we reach feel compelled to talk about it,"" what would happen?
First, it would require significant risk-taking. Which would include the risk of failure and the risk of getting fired (omg!). Can you and your team handle that? If not, might as well admit it and settle for good enough. But if you’re settling, don’t sit around wishing for results beyond what you’ve been getting.
Second, it would mean that every single time you set out to be remarkable, you’d have to raise the bar and start over. It’s exhausting.
Third, it means that the boss and the boss’s boss are unlikely to give you much cover. Are you okay with that?

What to do when you’re wrong,"The Red Cross gotsuedby J&J yesterday.
It turns out that in the 1800s, Johnson & Johnson had used the Red Cross symbol for more than a decade before the US non-profit started using it. It also turns out that they generously gave the organization the right, for free, to use the symbol for its work, forever, as long as they didn’t use it for reasons not directly related to their mission.
Mission? The Red Cross recently licensed their logo to abrand of surgical gloves, for example. Andfirst aid kitsthat a licensee sells at Target.
In the press release, Mark Everson, the Red Cross’ president, is quoted as saying,""For a multibillion-dollardrug company to claim thatthe Red Cross violated a criminal statute, . . . simply so thatJ&J can make more money, isobscene.""
I think that’s a typo. My guess is that Mr. Everson meant to say, ""Oops! J&J is a good corporate citizen, a significant donor to the Red Cross and the original and rightful owner of the trademark. We’ll unwind our deals as soon as we can and go back to focusing on what we do best.""
That’s what I would do, anyway.
[UPDATE: I got quite a bit of mail about this post, as I expected. I think I need to clarify something: I’m not asserting that J&J is legally or morally right, nor do I have expertise or knowledge in the history of the issue or the role of the International Red Cross. My point is this: The mission of the Red Cross in the US isn’t advanced by this fight. Thumbing a nose at a long time supporter and contributor doesn’t help them. Having a lawsuit doesn’t help them. Distracting senior management from the urgent issues at hand is silly. It tarnishes the group in the eyes of other corporate supporters, because companies don’t like to do business (or charity) with groups that are intransigent. So, by ""wrong"", I mean, ""off target, out of focus, in the wrong place."" Like that.]","August 9, 2007","Red Cross, Johnson & Johnson, trademark dispute"
No one expected a tornado,"New York City was shut down yesterday by three inches of rain and a tornado in Brooklyn. The trains, the subways, the roads… they all stopped working. There were small boulders on the West Side Highway and rivers of water everywhere.
Millions of critical citizens were answered by officials who pointed out that they had rehearsed for all sorts of events, but a tornado in New York?
What they’re missing is this: people weren’t complaining about the trains or the roads. They were complaining about the communication of the news. Commuters spent hours on trains into the city, only to find that the subways were closed, thus wasting the ride. I spent two hours on the road going to a meeting in the city–and the radio never once mentioned what was going on. The city didn’t start telling people to stay home until after 9 am… two hours late.

The 80:1 Freakonomics Paradox,"TheJournalreports that there are a slew ofFreakonomics-like books on the market. Some of them are actually pretty good, few are selling at all. My guess is that the original has outsold its competitors by about 80 to 1.
That’s not surprising if you talk to people. A good friend of mine who never ever reads books about business or economics just picked up a copy last week. She said, ""I think it’s time I read this, right?"" When a product becomes a hit, an entirely new class of people become interested in it, largely because it’s a hit.
Which leads to the paradox. The easiest products in the world to develop, option, license and get to market are copycat products. They are beyond reproach. They feel safe. In actuality, though, most markets aren’t big enough for two blockbusters. The first one dominates the little market, which allows it to break through and capture the attention of the big market. The bestseller creates the problem (I haven’t read that/tasted that/been there) and then solves that problem. The second (and third and fourth and fifth) are trying to sell a solution to people whono longer have the problem.
Sure, in the long run, a blockbuster can create an entirely new market that lasts for a long time (The Model T, for example, or Star Wars) but building your own blockbuster is generally a lot easier than copying someone else’s.",,"Freakonomics, paradox, blockbusters"
Shipping and handling,"Here’s aproductsold by a merchant via Amazon that costs about $2.50. Except that the shipping and handling are more than $8. And the item weighs about two ounces.
Shipping and handling charges have always been deceitful. Storefront merchants rarely charge ""for the little hangtags"" or add a ""mannikin surcharge"". When direct mail was new, sellers tried to persuade buyers that the prices were just as good as at the local store–and they segmented S&H as a way of comparing it to the hassle of driving over. When the shipping and handling for an order was $1 or 2, this wasn’t such a big deal.
Two things have changed. First, Amazon has taught millions that free shipping is the way the world should work. As a result, anything more than free just feels wrong. Second, other merchants have realized (like the squeeze bottle example above) that you can make 100% of your profit from shipping and handling and do quite well.

Blogs, of course, ought to be the perfect place to find people in trouble. The challenge is in getting past the ""I won’t click on an ad"" mindset that 80% of those online carry around. Guerrilla marketing works best when it takes the form of a sponsorship or other unexpected combination of advertiser and content. Blogs let you go farther than that, though.
The most effective marketing use of blogs seems to be when the advertiser/marketer uses the blog as an opportunitynotto sell a product, but to attract people who are in the right mindset.JoelSpolsky rarely writes about his product, but that’s fine.

For a nickel,"The currentFast Companyreports that when Ikea started charging a nickel for shopping bags, consumption went down by 50% (95% in the UK).
Clearly, it’s not the nickel.
The way you charge for something changes the way people perceive it. If the dinner special includes dessert, people get dessert because it’s ‘free’. Of course, it’s not free. You paid extra for the special, remember?
A la carte pricing focuses your consumer. It forces them to make a choice in a spot where they didn’t use to make a choice. It can highlight features that might have gone unnoticed (underbody salt removal treatment at the car wash, for example).
If you want people to notice a bit of consumption, charge for it. Even a penny.If you want people to take something they had been leaving behind, give it away with purchase. Otherwise, they’re wasting.
Here’s one practical application. If you make something with low marginal cost like a CD, consider offering a second one (same title) for a nickel or a dollar. Why?

Instead, like a million organizations before them, defending the status quo is far more politically correct than change. So they stand back and let dinky startups with no natural advantages run like crazy.

They give customers what they want, and embrace technology and new ideas because they have no other choice. The green curve, on the other hand, is filled with people who feel helpless. They feel like the organization is aligned against them, aligned to fail, all because the status quo is so powerful.
And yes, most of the time, it is the blue curve, the new guys, the ones playing by new rules with nothing to lose, that wins.

The power of chunking,"Aaron has posted a really powerfulmindmapof what he knows about internet marketing (which is a lot). I found several sites I didn’t know about and you will too.
But the mindmap part just gave me a headache. There really is a rule of seven when it comes to putting ideas into your head (which is why phone numbers have 7 digits…). When you launch a new idea on the world, odds are you’ve thought it through and realized many permutations of it. When you want to teach Social Studies to 12 year olds, there’s lots to teach. When you want to sell something to a business, the richness of your offering demands a great deal of detail.
Obviously, Aaron isn’t trying to get us to remember or even grok all the roots and leaves of his tree. My guess is that you will soon be writing down a few things to take action on, as opposed to figuring out how all the pieces fit together. It’s a checklist, in practice, at least it was for me.
Even though Aaron wasn’t trying to sell a single idea with overkill, sometimes, marketers are doing just that. They’re going overboard with all the benefits and features and wonders of the product or service they’re launching. Politicians make this mistake every single day.
Resist.
Seven is probably too many bullets. Three is more like it.
Three we can handle. Three is manageable and memorable and actionable. Give me three things and I can find a place for them in my brain. Each of those three things can probably have three subthings if you like. And then, at least for now, that’s it.","September 27, 2007","chunking, internet marketing, simplicity"
The ball bearing and the beach ball,"Michael Brookewrites,
1.      I am not publishing a magazine – I am helping to document and foster change within skateboarding. The magazine is part of a greater movement within skateboarding. Concrete Wave exists to spread specific ideas. The more people we can spread these ideas too, the more success we achieve.
2.      I am not merely building readers or subscribers – I am building a cult of supporters, each of whom will further support the cause and bring in more readers and subscribers.
3.      I build marketing INTO the product and distribution. By limiting the kinds of advertisers I allow, by keeping the editorial strictly focused and by carefully distributing the magazine, my readers and advertisers trust the magazine to deliver on its promise of 100% skateboarding. I will never betray that trust.
4.      Concrete Wave wishes to remain a ball bearing – small, hard to find and continually in the state of being polished. Our goal is to provide readers with a deep impression when they get hit with it. Conversely, we do not aim to be a beach ball – big, seen all over the place, colorful and yet leaving very little impression when it hits. A beach ball is very fragile indeed and must avoid challenging environments, because it requires so much air to keep it afloat. A weighty ball bearing can withstand both challenging environments along with the pin pricks of adversity.","September 26, 2007","Skateboarding, Community, Trust"
Who is Philip Roth?,"There are more than 100,000 published authors in the US. Most of them have publishing houses (and at least a tenuous connection to a publicist). What a great marketing problem. The long tail of authors meets the long tail of public interest. How do they intersect?
This is a challenge to authors. Since I know a lot of them (and since many I don’t know read this blog) I thought I’d do it here.
Authors like to read.
They also like to write.
Authors hate to promote themselves. And lots of authors don’t like the web so much, at least when it comes to promotion. It’s not like traveling to an independent bookstore and having tea with the owner while you sign books, or being interviewed for the book section of theTimes.Your favorite author probably doesn’t have a blog, probably doesn’t spend all her time online.
So, instead of a significant web presence that’s author-driven, we end up with publishers building their own promo sites (this onehas just 40 (!) authors and cost a fortune to build) or we get publishers insisting that all their authors build MySpace pages (just last week, in fact).
There are a few problems with this publisher-first approach. The first is that few readers know which authors are published by which publishers, so there’s no way they’re going to visit a particular site. The second is that authors aren’t going to spend the time to build (and maintain) fancy pages. The third is that because publishers have (legal/sales) trouble picking one bookseller over another, it’s really hard to close the sale and sell the book.
I think at the heart of this is the declining value of silos.
Publishers, like many organizations, want to control the conversation, want to own the web page, want to be sure that people come to them, as opposed to going where people are. The irony here is that bookstores are precisely the opposite of this. There’s no Knopf bookstore, no Random House store. Bookstores, unlike the current conception of car dealers, work best when they are agnostic about what’s for sale.
Authors are brands. Some are billion-dollar brands, some are tiny ones. The web is custom made for authors, but so far, it’s largely going unused.
Which brings us toSquidwho.Since we launched it a month ago, people have added more than 7,000 biographies. And most of them, alas, aren’t authors. We’ve got movie stars and politicians and yes, JK Rowling. I wish I had been surprised and had discovered scores of my fellow authors there, but alas, no.
Books aren’t the universal medium they used to be, but the industry still ought to be selling more books than we are today. I’m afraid that publishers and authors have embraced a broken system, even though there are tools out there ready to help.
When I set out to build my page onPhilip Roth, I discovered some very cool interviews, videos and entries about him. But no one had pulled it all together. No one made it easy to figure out what to buy and why. Forgive me for promoting my own project, but Squidwho just feels right to me. Useful and profitable and easy.
So, here’s the challenge.If you’re an editor, an agent, a publisher, an author or a fan, gobuild a pageabout an author you like. Or yourself. The worst thing that will happen is you’ll sell a ton of books and raise some money for charity.",,"Philip Roth, author promotion, publishing industry"
When you are ready to stand up to speak,"Perhaps you should consider sitting down.
When you are asked to give a short talk at the big company gathering, or contribute a few minutes in a large group discussion, and you’re ready to stand up and have all eyes on you, sometimes, perhaps, it makes sense to sit down instead.
If you’re a bit nervous and you’ve written everything out and your main goal is to say nothing controversial, nothing memorable,nothing that might get you in trouble… well, why say it?
If your job is to act as filler, to say a small not-so-funny joke and then stall for a minute or two, or your job is to put in an appearance, or perhaps to make sure that senior management knows you exist, I bet there are far better ways to pull that off.
The traffic engineers in New York think nothing of wasting two minutes of each person’s time as they approach a gated toll booth. Multiply that two minutes times 12,000 people and it’s a lot of hours every day, isn’t it? If you’re speaking to a thousand people for just a minute or two or three and you don’t have anything in particular to communicate, you’ve just wasted many hours of the most expensive time your organization has purchased this year.
Big groups are perfect places for the efficient communication of emotion. They are terrific for the impact that comes from watching your peers shake their heads in agreement simultaneously. The power of groupthink doesn’t happen in an electronic memo, but it can sure be powerful in a big room.
The flipside is obvious: if all you want to do is recite a fact or a policy or worst of all, not really be noticed, then it’s probably better to just sit down.",,"public speaking, group dynamics, effective communication"
Push and pull,"I can’t use internal wikis. ""It’s on the wiki"" is a dumb thing to say to me.
TV networks know how to put on one show at a time, in order, and broadcast it to whomever is tuning in.
These are two sides of the same coin. Sometimes we push information (like spam email, to pick a horrendous example, or the typical vapid fill-in-the-blank PR pitch to bloggers) and sometimes we wait for it to get pulled (like a blog or a wiki).
RSS transforms blogs from pull to push. The web transforms TV from push to pull.
[RSS is push because once you sign up for my blog, for example, each post is pushed to you. It starts as pull–you have tosign up–but then it no longer requires you to go hunt for it each day].
This isn’t trivial. It changes everything about the way you market what you market. I’d spend some time thinking about whether you push or pull, about whether you can flip that, and about whether your posture matches your message.","September 25, 2007","Push and pull, RSS, marketing strategy"

Meatball Mondae (#1),"In about three months, my next book,Meatball Sundae, will be published. I know, I know, I just published abook. I’m breaking the biggest rule in publishing. I’m trying your patience by doing another book so soon, but it really couldn’t wait. The new book is on a totally different topic, and it’s a lot longer and filled with examples and stuff. It’s about the internet and new marketing and the fourteen trends that change everything.
Every Monday for the next few months I’m going to publish a thought piece from the book. We’ll start with the basic premise then move on to the fourteen trends in the book. Here goes:
What’s a meatball sundae?
Maybe this is familiar. It is to me, anyway:
You go to a marketing meeting. There’s a presentation from the new Internet marketing guy. He’s brought a fancy (and expensive) blogging consultant with him. She starts talking about how blogs and the “Web 2.0 social media infrastructure” are just waiting for your company to dive in. “Try this stuff,” she seems to be saying, “and the rest of your competitive/structural/profit issues will disappear.”
In the last ten years, the Internet and radical changes in media have provided marketers everywhere with a toolbox that allows them to capture attention with seemingly little effort, planning, or cash. Six years after the dot-com boom, there are more Web sites, more email users, and more viral ideas, online and offline, than ever before. There are hundreds of cable TV networks and thousands of online radio stations. Not to mention street marketing, email marketing, and MySpace.
Corporations, political parties, nonprofits, job-seekers, and yes, even people looking for love are all scrambling around, trying to exploit the power of these new tools. People treat the New Marketing like a kid with a twenty-dollar bill at an ice cream parlor. They keep wanting to add more stuff—more candy bits and sprinkles and cream and cherries. The dream is simple: “If we can just add enough of [today’s hot topping], everything will take care of itself.”
Most of the time, despite all the hype, organizations fail when they try to use this scattershot approach. They fail to get buzz or traffic or noise or sales. Organizations don’t fail because the Web and the New Marketing don’t work. They fail because the Web and the New Marketing work only when applied to the right organization. New Media makes a promise to the consumer. If the organization is unable to keep that promise, then it fails.
New Marketing—whipped cream and a cherry on top—isn’t magical. What’s magical is what happens when an organization uses the New Marketing to become something it didn’t used to be—it’s not just the marketing that’s transformed, but the entire organization. Just as technology propelled certain organizations through the Industrial Revolution, this new kind of marketing is driving the right organizations through the digital revolution.
You can become the right organization. You can align your organization from the bottom up to sync with New Marketing, and you can transform your organization into one that thrives on the new rules.","September 24, 2007","New Marketing, digital revolution, transformation"
Marcel Marceau died,"…and despite the void he’ll leave, it’s almost impossible not to make a small joke.
And that’s the point, at least from a marketing point of view. Marceau made it through the Dip. He entered a field that was obscure, suffering from disrespect and filled with poseurs and hacks (all at the same time). But he pushed and focused and broke through. One person = an entire form of expression.
Jackson Pollack did it, as well. So did Yo-Yo Ma.
When a promoter wanted to book someone or promote someone or feature someone, there was only one choice. When Mel Brooks wanted a mime to speak in ""Silent Movie,"" there was only one choice. Only one choice is a good place to be.
The challenge is to find a field where the Dip is small enough to get through but big enough to matter.

Bought and sold,"Residential real estate is sold. You decide to sell your house, hire a broker and advertise and have open houses. The buyer gets the message and responds if interested.
NCAA stars are bought. The high school kids play their best football and scouts come and find them, court them and ‘buy’ their services.
Venture Capitalists do a little of both, but it’s primarily a sell function. Entrepreneurs write business plans and pitch them.
The hottest properties in an MBA program are often bought. Big consulting firms come on campus to interview, looking for the masters of the universe.
I think it’s interesting to consider flopping the buying and the selling.
Companies can go out and find startups that aren’t for sale and offer to buy them. Real estate investors can write to people about buying their homes–if and when they decide to sell.
Of course, this already happens, but not so much. When I ran Yoyodyne, we sold advertising to big companies like MasterCard, Procter & Gamble and AOL. And the ads worked. We had hundreds of clients and made thousands of sales calls… and I can’t remember once that someone called us up and asked to buy an ad. If they had, you can bet we not only would have been receptive, we would have been discounting our prices as well.
More important than the price break is the idea of being in control, of not just waiting for the next big thing to find you. When a buyer and seller get together, sometimes the possibilities for both sides increase.

Seven tips to build for meaning,"What happens after I click on your Google ad?
I was thinking about great Squidoo pages (lenses) yesterday, and realized that many of them, along with many blogs, have the same goal: give someone a handle, a sense of meaning–context–so they can go ahead and take action.

The reunion problem,"Here’s what’s hard:you’re running a 75th reunion for an organization and you want to invite as many past members as possible.
The internet should make this easy. Six degrees of separation, social networks, online profiles and Google should all make it automatic.
It’s not, for a few reasons. First, people rarely surface all of the details of their life online (or even in Facebook). Most of my readers, for example, have no clue about the undefeated hockey team I was on in 1973 (of course, the only goal I scored was on my own team, but that’s a story for another day). The second reason is that spammers would be all over this information if it were easy to find. If one could email every single Facebook user who came from Cleveland, the thing would fall apart. For good reason, permission to contact the right people isn’t easy to get.
While shouting about a reunion from a blog might work, it’s not particularly efficient, is it?
So, what would I build? It seems to me that the two steps are enumeration and contact. First, you need to list everyone you’re trying to reach, and then you need to figure out how to contact them. If there were a simple piece of web software available (basically a smarter wiki), you could reach out to the 20 or 50 or 500 alumni you already know, point them to that and get them busy enumerating the list. How many people can you list from cabin 7? Who’s missing?
Once you’ve got the list, put the six degrees thing to work. As each person on the list gets contacted, you can put a mark next to their name. As the list of the uncontacted gets smaller, it’s easier for people on the fringes to focus on who they know that might know the person that needs to get reached.
My guess is that the solution already exists, but a bit of googling failed to find it.
And, if you’re a Camp Arowhon alum (or you know one) and want to hear about the 75th reunion,drop a note to Marnieasap.

Blue jeans,"When I was in college, a local human rights group posted up signs around campus one Monday. They read:
On WednesdayWear Blue JeansIf You Are Gay
This is brilliant marketing. On Wednesday morning, you needed to have a discussion with yourself. ""Should I wear jeans?… if I’m in the closet… or if I’m supportive of the quest for rights… or if I don’t want to stand out… what will it mean if Idon’twear jeans? Or if I wear jeans and didn’t know about the sign…""
This, of course, was precisely the point. It started internal debate which led, all day, to spoken discussion. Which raised the issue.
A huge amount of marketing is about ""in"" or ignore. This is about ""in"" or ""out."" By forcing people to make a choice, they created a conversation.

Mean vs. Median,"How to be wrong: measure the mean when you really should measure the median.
Consider a website that reports a mean (average) of 2.1 pages per visitor.
Then realize that the median is9. (actually, my math nerd friends inform me that my example is impossible, because of the peskiness of zero and negative pages. I’ll leave the number here as a testament to my carelessness, and will inform you that my point remains correct… that the distribution is way more important than the average. I hope Godel will forgive me).
That’s because there’s a large number of people visiting 1 page and a large number visiting 10 or 20.
Once you see that, you will completely change your understanding of what’s happening and what you need to do to change it. (In this case, the goal wouldn’t be incremental improvement from 2.1 to 2.4. It would be to figure out how to activate the one-page people and turn them into 20-page viewers… a 2000% increase from each impacted person).
You’ll find the same behavior among McDonald’s customers. The typical (mean) American eats a meal at McDonald’s once every two weeks. But I never go and some people eat there twice a day. That’s a lot more useful to know.

Two kinds of ‘don’t know’,"I don’t know French. I can’t play the piano. I have no clue how to catch a bony spinefish. This is the first kind of don’t know. Stuff you don’t know because you haven’t been taught it yet. Books are awfully good at solving this problem, so are good teachers.
The second kind of ‘don’t know’ is often confused with the first type, but it’s really quite different. This is the person who says they don’t know how to cook, or that they can’t balance a checkbook. This isn’t about technique or a lack of knowledge. It’s usually either fear or lack of interest. People with this type of deficit won’t find the answer in a book or (usually) in a seminar either.You don’t learn how to cook from a cookbook.
The answer lies in trial and error and motivation and in overcoming the fear that makes us avoid the topic in the first place.
And why should a marketer care?
You need to care because if you try to solve the second kind of ignorance with a manual or a PDF or a blog post or even a long infomercial, you’re going to fail. If you discover that users are afraid or resistant to what you’re trying to get them to do, more information is almost always the incorrect response. The effective technique involves peer pressure and support and in changing the design and inputs of what you’re doing so that this group is more receptive to what’s on offer. For example, internet penetration isn’t up by a factor of 20 because people read a lot of copies ofInternet for Dummies.It happened because of what peers said to each other over time, and because the act of getting online is a lot easier than it used to be.

Sweet spot marketing,"Golf (or maybe tennis) has the true myth of the sweet spot. That special part of the club (racket) that magically makes the ball go farther and straighter.
There’s a sweet spot in promotion and PR as well. Let me give you a few examples from the book world to get us started:
Peter Druckerwas in the sweet spot for theHarvard Business Review. His background, reputation and style of writing contributed to him writing more pieces for them than anyone else. (My stuff, on the other hand, is blacklisted by the HBR. They won’t even consider my work.)
If you want to get reviewed by theNew York Times Book Review, don’t even consider self-publishing. Don’t write a how to book. Don’t write something particularly funny, either. But it sure helps to be published by Knopf. Literary fiction by respected writers published by Knopf is the sweet spot (history comes in a close second).
There’s a sweet spot for getting on Oprah and for being on NPR as well.You rarely hear about romance novels on All Things Considered.
My point isn’t that you shouldn’t try to get these middlemen to broaden their horizons or to give up on something you’re passionate about. It’s just that it might be easier to build a new sweet spot than it is to persuade an established middleman to change his rules for you.
I never had a chance with existing magazines so I invented a writing style for myself that worked well withFast Company, which until then had never had a columnist. Bloggers around the world are discovering that it’s cheaper and faster and more effective to build their own media channel than it is to waste time arguing with the old ones.
So I guess my advice would be to either build your product and network along the way to align with exactly what the middlemen want… or reject them and live/thrive without them. It’s the middle ground that’s really frustrating.","September 16, 2007","Sweet spot, promotion, media channel"
Alarm clocks,"For twenty cents or so, alarm clock manufacturers can add a chip that not only knows the time (via a radio signal) but knows what day it is too. Which means that they can add a switch that says ""weekends."" Which means that the 98% of the population that doesn’t want to wake up on the same time on weekends as they do on weekdays will be happier (and better rested.)
This isn’t as complicated or expensive as myideafour years ago.
So why doesn’t every alarm clock have this feature? Because most people in that business are busy doing their jobs (distribution, promotion, pricing, etc.), not busy making products that people actually want to buy–and talk about.

You get to choose,"That’s the cool thing about marketing. Unlike most other functions in the organization, you get to choose where and how you do what you do.
If you don’t have the money to do a full-scale TV campaign that’s going to work, you shouldn’t choose TV.If you don’t have the organizational support to engage in a long-term grassroots strategy, don’t do it.
I was talking to a journalist aboutbootstrappingthe other day and he wanted me to share some examples of big, capital-intensive companies that got their start by bootstrapping. My answer was pretty simple, ""If you don’t have a lot of capital, don’t choose a business that requires it.""
If you have an organization that is slow and deliberative, don’t enter a market that rewards the fleet of foot.If you have colleagues that love to discuss everything out loud, don’t choose a campaign that will fail if the market senses internal discussion and disagreement…
Don’t raise VC money for a business that can’t possibly pay off for the investors. Don’t promote a lunch menu in a neighborhood where no one goes out for lunch.

Punishing the outliers,"Mushahid points out that a nearby McDonald’s has a sauce policy. If you want six or eight packets of dipping sauce for your chicken knuckles (or whatever), they charge you for them. The sign is big and loud and probably in ALL CAPITAL letters.
I can see why this happened.
99 people out of a hundred take one or two packets of sauce. One guy takes 20. This is infuriating. You lost money on this guy. He’s a pig. He probably hordes the sauce and uses it on his eggs in the morning or whatever.
Like the jerks who buy a couch at DWR and then return it after the party.
Just because you’re in business doesn’t mean you have to be a patsy, doesn’t mean you have to give away everything all the time. Or does it?
There are two pieces of math that might help you figure this out. The first is simple: How much do the bad guys cost us? If it’s a cost of doing business, it’s probably not worth changing your atmosphere/guarantee/state of mind over. Sure, shoplifting would go down if you locked up each item behind the glass. But punishing the majority costs you far more than the theft does.
The second is a little more subtle: does the bad behavior spread or damage the experience of the good guys. Not in the sauce example, certainly, but yes when it comes to people spamming your comments board or smoking in the elevator.
If I were McDonald’s, I’d just add another item to the menu: Extra sauce, 20 cents. Give your frontline staff the authority to waive the fee for good customers or small extras (""I’m supposed to charge you for the extra sauce, but don’t worry about it, it’s free for you today."") but it’s an easy way to deal with the guy who wants 25 packets.

Jeff points us to Done, an SEO firm that claims it can quash bad reviews from showing up in Google. Sort of a reverse SEO play, they offer to take angry customer rants or riffs on sites likeConsumer Reportsandmake them less likely to show up in a Google search.MSNBCreports that they point to success with companies likeWebLoyalty.com. (Typical searchhere).Marketers love this story. They love the idea that SEO could be done in reverse and that unfair and unjust besmirchments can be made to disappear.
The problem, of course, is that while the story is seductive, it’s not particularly true. As soon as a company starts to push the bad stuff down, someone writes about it or new bad stuff shows up and on it goes… Even worse, not only is there always another bad thing to push down, but the act of writing about what the company is doing (like I’m doing now) makes it even more difficult to ""manage your reputation"" by burying the critics.

Let’s make up some numbers,"TheTimesreports today that the MPAA has released a study that DVD pirates are costing New York City $903 million a year in lost wages.
Making up numbers is a brilliant marketing technique, especially when the numbers are precise and untestable. Ivory Soap, after all, is 99 and 44/100 % pure.
$903 million is about 9,000 jobs paying $100,000 a year each. That’s a lot of ticket takers, Blockbuster clerks and gaffers. And yet the Times reprints the numbers as true.
Marketers make up numbers all the time. It’s a great way to tell a story with efficiency, and if you do it in the right spirit (meaning that the numbers are as close to true as you can get them) there’s little downside or damage. Except to your reputation when you’re wrong…
Do we need to know how much the Dow moved to a tenth of a point? No, of course not. But when we start delivering numbers with that level of accuracy, people can’t help but believe them.","September 11, 2007","marketing, statistics, credibility"
Big ideas,"Padmanabhan wrote me a nice note today, asking why I so freely give away ideas. (It was nice because he thought some of the ideas were actually good ones).
I responded that ideas are easy, doing stuff is hard.
My feeling is that the more often you create and share ideas, the better you get at it. The process of manipulating and ultimately spreading ideas improves both the quality and the quantity of what you create, at least it does for me.
History is littered with inventors who had ""great"" ideas but kept them quiet and then poorly executed them. And history is lit up with do-ers who took ideas that were floating around in the ether and actually made something happen. In fact, just about every successful venture is based on an unoriginal idea, beautifully executed.
So, if you’ve got ideas, let them go. They’re probably holding you back from the hard work of actually executing.",,"ideas, execution, creativity"
Thinking about this war,"This is the first war that’s a marketing war.
The New York Police Department just released areporton Jihad and terrorism. [It seems as though the NYPD has taken the document down. Not sure why….Hereit is.] It’s controversial, particularly among peoplewho haven’t read it. I’m going to skip over some of the ethnicgeneralizations and focus on other parts of the document… I thinkthere are some fascinating implications for marketing in this document,so here’s my riff (those who wish I would just write about selling soapshould skip to my next post).
How come there are no longer any famous bank robbers?
During the heyday of bank robbery (from Butch Cassidy to JohnDillinger), banks were a great option for criminals. After all, that’swhere the money is.
The FBI realized that they didn’t just have a crime problem. Theyhad a marketing problem. Bad guys knew that robbing banks paid. In response, the FBIdid a few things. First, they focused on catching every single bankrobber. And second, and more important, they built Alcatraz andpromoted it like crazy.
Alcatraz marketed a concept. ""Bank robbery is a really bad idea."" Combinethat with some big arrests, marked bills, silent alarms, video camerasand some movies and TV shows and the act of robbing a bank shifted fromeasy to dumb. There’s no doubt that Dick Tracy and the FBI TV series did more to stop bank heists than bullets ever did. The money might have been in the banks, but smart crooks looked elsewhere to commit their crimes.
No ads were purchased, but marketing was done nonetheless. Stop fora minute and think about that. The FBI did this on purpose. Theymarketed to criminals. They spread an ideavirus.
Some people saw the post 9/11 world as an enforcement problem. Withenough guns and wiretaps (along with a modern Alcatraz), the idea wasthat a similar sort of anti-crime marketing could be effective. Catchevery single terrorist and put them in a high profile jail. I don’tagree with this perspective. There’s still a marketing problem, butit’s a different one.
As the NYPD report points out, fundamentalist terrorism is anideavirus. It spreads (via mass media) but unlike bank robbers,Jihadists and others are far more immune to the idea of lawenforcement. In fact, unlike the bank robbery meme, the ideavirus thatleads to this behavior is actuallyenhancedand further spread by traditional enforcement tactics and martyrdom.
The NYPD report frequently mentions the Internet as an enabler andconnector, but monitoring and regulating the internet isn’t going to beeffective in stopping the problem. If the RIAA can’t stop file sharing,imagine how difficult it will be to hinder the spread of text online.The medium is far too permeable. If we shut down all media, including the Internet, we could slow the virus, but even that wouldn’t stop it–and no one is willing to pay that price.
The best way to counter an ideavirus, any ideavirus, is not bychallenging the medium in which it spreads. It didn’t stop pirate radioor salacious TV shows or online porn. What has always worked the bestis countering one ideavirus with another one. To use the same medium tospread a different, better, more powerful ideavirus. You don’t counterracism by making the act of uttering racist statements against the law. You do it byspreading an idea (racism is hateful, wrong and stupid) that keeps theracist from expressing his ideas because all his friends will shun himif he does.
If you want moderate ideas to spread in a community, promote thepeople who are spreading those ideas. Make them heroes. Amplify theirmessage and help it spread.
Hamas leverages and extends its power with the Palestinians by providinghealth care in neighborhoods. That’s the message that gets through tothe people on the ground. Every action a group (any group) takes tells a story.What’s that story? Does it spread? When it spreads, how does that storyaffect the conversations that people have with each other? If the NYPDis right (and I think their analysis of how this meme spreadsisright) then the most important thing our government can do is discusswhat sort of ideavirus they are working to spread. And then takeaction. And spread the right story in the right way.
What’s the story? What is the TSA ‘saying’ in their work at LAX?What is the brave soldier saying as she does her stint in Takrit? Whatdoes the NYPD or the school district or the local hospital say as theyinteract with immigrants in their daily lives?
I guarantee you I don’t know the answer.I don’t know wherewe should send troops and how long we should stay there. I don’t knowwho to arrest and what to look for. But I do know this: it’s amarketing problem, the most important one we face. By and large, themarketing is being done by people who don’t see that we have amarketing problem. Understanding the words and concepts behind theideavirus is the critical next step in spreading the right message tothe people who need to hear it.
I sat in my office six years ago, looking south along the Hudson and watching our world change. I don’t think anyone could have predicted then where we’d be now. I’m hopeful that by looking forward, we can market our way to better place. Thousands of brave people have sacrificed for our safety and peace of mind. I’m grateful to them. The next step is to get smart about strategy and marketing.",,"marketing, ideavirus, terrorism"
The haystack,"It’s easy to be wowed by what a magical job the search engines do in finding you just the right needle in the haystack.
The fact is that search engines are very good at fairly simple searches, and very good at finding information about single products, services, people and ideas.
But they’re terrible at connections, at rankings, at horizontal results. They can’t help me find the 25 most important up and coming artists in the United States. They can’t help me find six products that are viable alternatives to something that was just discontinued. They can’t help me rank the service of four accounting firms.
There’s a giant opportunity. (Many opportunities, actually). It’s to collate and slice and dice and rank domain-specific knowledge and surface it. There are some areas where this is done extremely well (restaurants, for example), but in most cases, it’s not done at all.
Organizing the world’s information is a laudable goal. But we’re only an inch down the road.","September 10, 2007","search engines, information organization, domain-specific knowledge"
Random Acts of Initiative,"As a young first-year student at the Stanford MBA program (most of the other 300 students had wasted a few years working at a bank, but he came straight from undergrad) Chip Conley picked out four other students–strangers to him and to each other–and invited them to a weekly brainstorming session. He explained to us that once a week we’d meet for four hours and brainstorm business plans and entrepreneurial ventures.
A year later, we had compiled more than 500 great ideas, countless lousy ones and  had figured out how to think about the structure of a business. I think the five of us would all agree we learned more in that room in the anthropology department than we did in the classes we were paying for.
The extraordinary thing about Chip’s little bit of initiative in setting up the group is how rare it is. Successful people have this in common. It’s not the giant breakthroughs, it’s the willingness to take little chances.
Chip has gone on to be the most successful of our team, running one the largest independent hotel chains in California. We had a deal… I agreed not to open hotels, he agreed not to write books. Well, once again, he broke his end of thebargain.
Even if you don’t have an anthropology department nearby, there’s no doubt that there’s some small piece of initiative you can grab a hold of tomorrow.","September 9, 2007","initiative, entrepreneurship, brainstorming"
How to spend $20 million,"Treating different customers differently is important.
Customers actually like it if you do it right. People in coach don’t mind the folks in first class getting more service, because they’d like to be there one day. (Or because they like the fact that the people paying too much for a fancy seat are subsidizing their flight). People at nightclubs like watching celebrities being whisked to the front of the line, because it reinforces their belief that they’re at a special place.
The trouble kicks in not when you treat different people differently but if it’s random, or unfair or unpredictable.
When Steve Jobs gave a $200 discount to the late adopters of the iPhone, the early adopters were incensed. They were being treated differently, but in the wrong way. My guess is that his $100 store credit and personal note helped a great deal, but it also cost about $20 million in profit. If Apple had thought it through, he could have offered any of the following (and done it during the presentation he did of the new products):
The key is to not give price protection to early buyers (that’s unsustainable as a business model) but to make them feel more exclusive, not less.
As for being capricious, consider this photo from the US Open. The Open doesn’t allow spectators to bring in backpacks of any size–IF the straps are padded. They don’t announce this rule, and they enforce is somewhat randomly.
If it were really a security issue, they’d have to enforce it completely. If it’s just a silly policy that someone dreamed up one day, it’s sure to annoy people. Because it’s irrational. Because it’s not enforced in a way that makes sense.
So yes, treat different customers differently. The more the better, actually. But do it consistently and in a way that your customers respect and understand.","September 8, 2007","customer treatment, exclusivity, fairness"

NBC and missing the point about power,"A lot of buzz this week about NBCswitchingfrom iTunes to Amazon.
One can’t help but be reminded of the rearranging of deck chairs.
For fifty years, NBC’s major asset was that there were only three TV networks. That meant that all other things being equal, there was a 33% chance you’d tune in. They had a partial lock on attention.TV Guidewas important, but it didn’t have enough power to make or break a network.
Welcome to the new age, guys.
Now NBC has a .00001% chance of being picked at random, and plenty of competition for attention. It also means that there’s a new powerbroker, a middle man with far more power in influencing what people watch (and pay for).
NBC could have been this middleman. They ceded this role to YouTube and then iTunes. Switching to Amazon merely creates a third player, but it doesn’t do what the networks truly needed to do–build a direct relationship between the network and the viewer. Amazon has one, so does Apple.
This is the major scramble of this generation… who gets permission to talk to the consumer, to represent the consumer, to determine what’s hot and what’s not. If all three of these players gain power, my guess is that content providers will provide content to all three. On the middleman’s terms. If you’re not listed, you’re invisible.","September 7, 2007","NBC, powerbroker, streaming competition"

Yet another frontier ruined,"…by marketers.
Apparently, the gurus at Jupiter (""Flip a coin!"") have issued a report about viral marketing. Micah points us to:Viral Campaigns Falling Short, Says JupiterResearch – 09/05/2007. The article says that the thrust of the report is that marketers are failing at viral campaigns because it only works 15% of the time, and that the most popular technique was ""targeting influentials.""
Excuse me… the most effective technique is making stuff worth talking about in the first place. True viral marketing happens not when the marketer plans for it or targets bloggers or skateboarders or pirates with goatees, but when the item/service/event isworth talking about.
There, now you don’t have to buy a study to know what to do next. [I feel badly to be picking on a report I haven’t even read. I hate it when people do that. I guess my knee jerk reaction occurred because marketers are always the first to look for a shortcut… and the shortcut is almost always the long way around.

As a result, we end up hiring people who are good at self-marketing, not at what we need them to do.
It may very well be that this programmer or that cleaning person or this animator is absolutely terrible at the things that make it easy to get hired. Is there anything wrong with that?

So, any carrier can offer it (hence the free part), any developer can easily modify it/enhance it, and the thing is paid for by location-aware permission marketing.

Labor Day,"I’m working today. In fact, if I’m conscious, I’m working. That’s largely because it doesn’t seem like ‘work’ today. I’d write this blog even if no one read it.
More and more people are lucky enough to have a gig like mine… work you’d do even if you didn’t have to, even if you didn’t get paid to do it. This is a bigger idea than it seems, because it changes the posture of what you do. Different motivations ought to lead to different results.
My version goes like this: If I’m doing this for fun (and I am) then I might as well doing something remarkable/great/worth doing. Otherwise, why bother?
Here’s something I wrote in 2003, shortly beforePurple Cowcame out. I reference it a lot, I guess I think it’s good:
Your great-grandfather knew what it meant to work hard. He hauled hay all day long, making sure that the cows got fed. InFast Food Nation, Eric Schlosser writes about a worker who ruptured his vertebrae, wrecked his hands, burned his lungs, and was eventually hit by a train as part of his 15-year career at a slaughterhouse. Now that’s hard work.
The meaning of hard work in a manual economy is clear. Without the leverage of machines and organizations, working hard meant producing more. Producing more, of course, was the best way to feed your family.
Those days are long gone. Most of us don’t use our bodies as a replacement for a machine — unless we’re paying for the privilege and getting a workout at the gym. These days, 35% of the American workforce sits at a desk. Yes, we sit there a lot of hours, but the only heavy lifting that we’re likely to do is restricted to putting a new water bottle on the cooler. So do you still think that you work hard?
You could argue, ""Hey, I work weekends and pull all-nighters. I start early and stay late. I’m always on, always connected with a BlackBerry. The FedEx guy knows which hotel to visit when I’m on vacation."" Sorry. Even if you’re a workaholic, you’re not working very hard at all.
Sure, you’re working long, but ""long"" and ""hard"" are now two different things. In the old days, we could measure how much grain someone harvested or how many pieces of steel he made. Hard work meant more work. But the past doesn’t lead to the future. The future is not about time at all. The future is about work that’s really and truly hard, not time-consuming. It’s about the kind of work that requires us to push ourselves, not just punch the clock. Hard work is where our job security, our financial profit, and our future joy lie.
It’s hard work to make difficult emotional decisions, such as quitting a job and setting out on your own. It’s hard work to invent a new system, service, or process that’s remarkable. It’s hard work to tell your boss that he’s being intellectually and emotionally lazy. It’s easier to stand by and watch the company fade into oblivion. It’s hard work to tell senior management to abandon something that it has been doing for a long time in favor of a new and apparently risky alternative. It’s hard work to make good decisions with less than all of the data.
Today, working hard is about taking apparent risk. Not a crazy risk like betting the entire company on an untested product. No, an apparent risk: something that the competition (and your coworkers) believe is unsafe but that you realize is far more conservative than sticking with the status quo.
Richard Branson doesn’t work more hours than you do. Neither does Steve Ballmer or Carly Fiorina. Robyn Waters, the woman who revolutionized what Target sells — and helped the company trounce Kmart — probably worked fewer hours than you do in an average week.
None of the people who are racking up amazing success stories and creating cool stuff are doing it just by working more hours than you are. And I hate to say it, but they’re not smarter than you either. They’re succeeding by doing hard work.
As the economy plods along, many of us are choosing to take the easy way out. We’re going to work for the Man, letting him do the hard work while we work the long hours. We’re going back to the future, to a definition of work that embraces the grindstone.
Some people (a precious few, so far) are realizing that this temporary recession is the best opportunity that they’ve ever had. They’re working harder than ever — mentally — and taking all sorts of emotional and personal risks that are bound to pay off.
Hard work is about risk. It begins when you deal with the things that you’d rather not deal with: fear of failure, fear of standing out, fear of rejection. Hard work is about training yourself to leap over this barrier, tunnel under that barrier, drive through the other barrier. And, after you’ve done that, to do it again the next day.
The big insight: The riskier your (smart) coworker’s hard work appears to be, the safer it really is. It’s the people having difficult conversations, inventing remarkable products, and pushing the envelope (and, perhaps, still going home at 5 PM) who are building a recession-proof future for themselves.

We accidentally marketed ourselves into a corner,"What if I told you about an industry which:
…and
…according to most of the studies I’ve seen, there’s very little or no difference in the efficacy of one competitor vs. another.
Of course, I’m talking about undergraduate colleges in the US.
The most competitive colleges are as competitive as ever–in most cases, more so. Many admit only one in ten students. According to two senior officials at Swarthmore, the differences among the ‘good enough’ applicants is basically zero. Rather than putting tens of thousands of kids through insane anxiety, they wonder, why not just put all the ‘good enough’ students in a pool and pick the winners randomly?
Here’s the amazing part: According toThe Chosen, an exhaustive study of college admissions, there’s no measurable difference between the outcomes of education with the most exclusive schools and the next few tiers. Graduates don’t end up happier. They don’t end up with better paying jobs. They don’t end up richer or even healthier.  The whole thing is a sham (which costs a quarter of a million dollars a person at the top end).
There’s no question that a Harvard degree helps (or is even required) in a few fields. There’s also no doubt that spending four years at Yale is a mind-changing experience. The question isn’t, ""are they wonderful?"" The question is, ""Is it worth it?""
It’s almost as if every single high school student and her parents insisted on having a $200,000 stereo because it was better than the $1,000 stereo. Sure, it might be a bit better, but is it betterenough?
Boomer parents have bought in to the marketing hype at a level rarely seen in any other form of marketing. They push school districts, teachers and their kids to perform pointless tasks at extreme levels just to be admitted to the ‘right’ school, even though there’s hardly evidence that the right school does anything but boost their egos.
Schools respond by spending a fortune on facilities that will increase their rankings in various faux polls, even though there’s no evidence at all that a better gym or a bigger library matters one bit to an undergraduate’s long-term success in life.
If it weren’t so expensive (in terms of time and money) it would make a marvelous marketing case study. Add in the tears and wasted anxiety and it’s really a shame. Very few people are pointing out that the emperor is barely clothed, and those that do (like me, I guess) get yelled at.
I’m not criticizing a college education per se. No, it’s clear that that’s a smart investment. I’m talking about the incremental cost (and anxiety) separating consumers of the ‘top’ 500 schools from students of the ‘top’ 50. It appears to be pure storytelling, a story that so appeals to the worldview of baby boomers with teens that they are absolutely unable to resist the story, despite the facts.
High school students are thrust into a Dip, in some cases the biggest one of their lives.The Dipextracts significant costs along the way, and then ends with a giant spin of the roulette wheel. I wonder if we’re marketing ourselves to a dead end.
I guess I’d do two things. First, I’d figure out how to teach parents to understand what really matters and what doesn’t about time spent in high school and the choice of a college. Second, I’d push for every selective college to share one application and do a draft similar to the one they do for medical residencies. Every applicant ranks the schools they’d like to attend, in order. Every school considers all the applications, grabs the students they’d love to have in priority order, puts the rest into the ""good enough"" pile and lets a computer sort em all out as pareto optimally as possible. At least kids will go into their twenties correctly blaming a computer instead of mistakenly blaming themselves.","October 31, 2007","college admissions, marketing hype, educational equity"

Farming domains,"To pick up a bit on yesterday’spost,one strategy that smart domain owners are pursuing isn’t particularly groundbreaking: they’re putting up good content.
When you have millions of free visits, it’s okay if you’re sloppy, it’s okay if you waste some and it’s okay if you don’t get organic traffic.
For a long time, domain owners acted like real estate investors. Buy. Hold. Sell.
Now, though, they’re starting to act like real estate developers. Buy. Build. Hold. Make money on ‘rent’.
To that end, we did a deal with the people who own ever.com.Everisn’t a particularly useful domain name (though it’s short). So organic traffic is pretty limited, especially if you just put up a few links.
Enter the newever.com. We hooked up the Squidoo engine to it and people have already built pages like:best.cameras.ever,best.lyrics.ever,funkiest.mammal.everand evenworst.president.ever.We’re limiting the number of pages built per person, and after thirty days, if the page isn’t improved and promoted, we put it back the pool.

Thinking about domains,"Thirteen years ago, Josh Quittner wrote an article inWiredthat almost made me richer than Donald Trump.
He wrote about how many domain names were up for grabs, including McDonalds.com.
Inspired, I sat down and registered hundreds of them. I was about to hit the ‘buy’ button when my office mate persuaded me that it was somehow unethical. Persuaded, I only ended up buying one or two generic terms.
Shoot.
Anyway, a decade and a half later, boom over, domains persist. Many are worth a fortune, tens of thousands are worth a semi-fortune.
Why are they still worth so much?
For a long time, clueless surfers would type a word into the address bar of their browser, figuring it was some sort of magic search engine. Type ""gloves"" into the address bar of Safari, and yes, it will take you to www.gloves.com.
But Firefox and others are wising up and connecting that spot to the search engines. Type ""gloves"" into Firefox and you’ll automatically go to the number one result on Google. Research shows that the number of people who accidentally end up on these sites is going down.So why the value?
I’m going to argue that it comes from two things.
1. Commitment. Because there’s ony one ""dot com"" TLD and no serious contenders, there’s only one neighborhood for business online. You’re either on Fifth Ave. (or Rodeo Drive, your choice) or you’re not. If you build a site atmexicansugarskull.com, you’re making it really clear to the surfer that you care about this topic, that you’re here to stay and that you can be trusted.
2. Focus. Similar, but not quite the same. By having a domain that matches what you do, you are able to focus the attention of the surfer. They know what to expect before they get there, and you can spend less time explaining yourself. The web already offers too many choices–this way, your site doesn’t have to.
I think this can help lead us to some useful strategies. If you own domains:
If you don’t own a domain that’s a perfect match (and that’s most of us):
Over the last few weeks, Squidoo has launched a number of new domains to take advantage of this focus impulse:Squidbids,SquidvidsandSquidwho,to name a few.
I’ve been amazed at how quickly people ‘get it’ when they visit each domain, and how productive the effort has been. The internet has taught people what to do when they see a domain. It’s not just an address, it’s the first bit of marketing.

In 1960, the typical stay for a book on the New York Times bestseller list was 22 weeks. In 2006, it was two. Forty years ago, it was typical for three novels a year to reach #1. Last year, it was 23.
Advise and Consentwon the Pulitzer Prize in 1960. It’s 640 pages long.On Bullshitwas a bestseller in 2005; it’s 68 pages long.
Commercials used to be a minute long, sometimes two. Then someone came up with the brilliant idea of running two per minute, then four. Now there are radio ads that are less than three seconds long.It’s not an accident that things are moving faster and getting smaller. There’s just too much to choose from. With a million or more books available at a click, why should I invest the time to read all 640 pages of Advise and Consent when I can get the idea after 50 pages?

A glance at their San Francisco listings shows more than 33,000 ads for housing. That means that if an apartment doesn’t sound perfect after just a sentence or two, it’s easy to glance down at the next ad.

Permeability,"Here’s an interesting question for the next telemarketer who calls you, or for the next clerk or customer service person you touch base with: ""What’s the name of the president of your company?""
There’s a reason it matters. If the leadership of a company are cut off from vivid, direct contact with the front line, they are cutting off important information. Not just data, which is easy to summarize in a graph or a report, but visceral information that they remember and take action on.
Years ago, I took a friend to a chicken slaughterhouse in the Bronx. You pick a chicken, they bring it into the back room and bring you back fresh chicken parts. The thing you notice when you are walking to the car is that the bag is warm. A little different from the supermarket. Something you never forget, actually.
That’s how most CEOs and top managers make decisions. Not based on unemotional data, but on emotion-rich, experience-based stories.

"End your tasks, end your job?","One reason for organizational paralysis is that it’s easy to believe that if your tasks go away, your job goes away.
If you’re the district manager for the Yukon Territory and the company stops serving the Yukon, you’re going to get fired, aren’t you? If you are the product manager for the evangelical market and it’s determined that this market isn’t growing fast enough, what’s going to happen to you?
It’s no wonder, then, that groupthink and politics and natural defenses kick in every time strategy is discussed.
The thing is, in most organizations, when the Yukon gets shut down, the district managerdoesget laid off. Big mistake.
As soon as management starts conflating people with tasks, they’ve  guaranteed that the organization is going to get stuck. Probably soon. A better plan: rotate your people and continually reward and promote and challenge them. Make a big deal when someone makes the case for shutting down her task.

“I can’t afford it”,"That’s not true.
At least it’s not true almost all the time. Very few of your prospects literally can’t afford it. What they are really trying to say is, ""it’s not worth it."" As in, it’s not worth reprioritizing my life, not worth the risk, not worth what I’ll have to give up to get this, not worth being in debt for.
One response to repeated cries of ""I can’t afford it"" is to lower your prices. A better response is to tell a better, more accurate story, and to tell it to the right people. The best response is to make something worth paying for.",,"affordability, value perception, pricing strategy"
Surveys,"Thanks to the internet, surveys are a lot cheaper than they used to be. And the prevalence of roll-your-own amateur surveys means that we all have a lot to learn.
A survey can teach your customers or it can help you learn from them.
And it might be a real survey, or it could be a census.
The traditional understanding of a survey is that the goal is to LEARN from your population and that you will ask a scientific sampling, not everyone.
You can TEACH people with a survey, though, simply by asking them questions that help them notice things they never noticed before. ""Do your prefer option A or option B,"" might just be a way of getting people to notice that you even have an option B.
The very act of asking a question may change the experience for the customer. One small firm I know shows prospects a book of testimonials. Then they say, ""I hope that when we’ve completed our job for you, you’ll be willing to write one too."" That seed increases the likelihood that people are going to be looking for something good to say, which increases the likelihood that they’ll enjoy the event.
Of course, this can spiral out of control pretty quickly.Push polling, in which faux pollsters call people up and ask them questions with patently false assumptions about competing candidates, for example, is just wrong.
But don’t forget the hybrid solution, which I call a Trident survey. ""4 out of 5 dentists surveyed recommend sugarless gum…"" Hardly scientific, but publishing the results made dentists feel better about recommending the gum and made people with teeth happier about chewing it.
Which leads to the question of how many people you’re going to ask. Professional surveyors almost never ask everyone. They carefully select a representative sample (not so easy) and invest in each interview, thus scaling the results for the whole population. That’s howNielsenworks.
There are plenty of inexpensive ways to ask EVERYONE your question, though. That turns your survey into a census. A census only works, of course, when the response rate is close to 100%, because uneven response rates are going to skew your results.
Analyticsis a form of census survey. You can track how everyone who visits your website behaves.Focus groups, on the other hand, are a poor use of just about anyone’s resources, because they are inherently not surveys at all. Without a skilled moderator, all you get is useless (but extremely vivid) data.
So, I guess I’d summarize the survey question by identifying four kinds of surveys that are worth doing:
One last warning: round off. 98.2% is a bogus result. ""Most"" is a lot more accurate. The ultimate purpose of most traditional surveys is to make decisions. Alas, your audience is often the very worst group to help you make a decision. When you let a survey be presented as accurate, it becomes the silent decision maker in the room and leads, often, to mediocre products for the middle of the market.

Internal marketing,"In the middle of its biggest growth spurt ever, just before Christmas,Apple fired 800 of its employeesfor stealing. They were caught grabbing $100 rebates on the iPhones Apple had given them for free.
The impact of this sort of action is pure marketing. It sends a powerful message to every other employee (and eventually the public). Most organizations would waffle, or hesitate at the scale of the firing or try to come up with an excuse for the really really good employees.

The New York Times Bestseller List,"Cumulative advantageis a powerful side effect of story telling. Get out front, even a little, and you sell more because many people like to invest in a winner. We like to read what other people are reading.
A classic example of cumulative advantage is the power of theTimes’list.
Rebecca has a goodpostabout the list but she misses the two key points.
The first: TheTimes’list is completely fictional. Made up. Divorced from reality. The stated goal of the list is to find (and promote) books thatTimeseditors want people to read, not books that are actually selling a lot. (The editor of the Book Review told this to me years ago). So, they make up ‘rules’ to appear consistent. WhenHarry Potterwas selling like crazy, they invented a new list so that they could take JK Rowling’s books off the real list. When diet and other books started selling a lot, they made up a new ghetto (miscellaneous) for those books. When books started selling in places like Wal-Mart (thus driving the snootiness factor down) theTimespenalized sales in chain outlets. And books like the Bible are banished because they’re not current enough.
The second: the list is easier to manipulate than ever before. The identity of reporting stores is becoming easier to find and the leverage of being on the list is high enough that authors can profit just by buying their own books in enough quantity.
The best part… it doesn’t matter. Cumulative advantage is so powerful that even though the accurate reports of book sales often completely contradict theTimeslist, authors and others still obsess over it. We’re always looking for clues, especially in crowded markets.
The thing that amazes me is that there are so few bestseller lists in other markets. Consumers want them. Producers can leverage them. It’s an opportunity, I think.","October 22, 2007","Cumulative advantage, Bestseller list, Manipulation"

As I stood in the store looking at the racks and racks of glasses (90% profit margins!) I understood why this business is so lucrative.

The need to be right,"I don’t think you can underestimate how important it is to most people to be right.
People choose jobs, products, partnerships… just about everything… in many ways because it makes them feel right or at least diminishes the chance that they will be ‘caught’ being wrong.
The customer isalways right. When they’re wrong, they’re not your customer any more, because it’s better to flee than be wrong.
Myposton wikipedia really hit a nerve with a large number of readers. In many cases, the feedback I got was that the article in wikipedia might be wrong or vandalized. And if the underlying article is wrong, well, then you would be wrong. And being wrong is… bad.
I like being wrong. Not enough to make a habit of it, but enough to realize that I’m actively testing scenarios. Take a fact of dubious authenticity, riff a scenario around it and see if it feels right. That act of scenario building is a key factor in brainstorming, in creativity and in problem solving. If you need the core fact to be guaranteed right and perfect, you’re doomed, because facts like that are in short supply.
Are you setting up your customers to be right and to feel right? Or is the risk of ‘wrong’ holding them back?
[I know, there’s a huge need to have right facts and right practice, particularly in jobs where quality of service is essential. Got that. My point is that we’re so good at getting those sort of facts right that maybe, just maybe, we need to spend more time teaching people the other stuff.

The wikipedia gap,"I wonder who the first teacher was who said to his class, ""Okay, we have ball point pens now. No need to use class time to learn how to use a fountain pen.""
I heard from two people this week (one is 11, the other twice that) who were forbidden to use Wikipedia to do homework.
When I was in b-school, I admit that I discovered a shortcut. I had to write a long paper on Castro. I went to the magnificent Stanford library, found a great book on Castro, opened to the bibliography and found ten sources. Which I then laboriously paged through, spending hours and hours in order to find the facts I needed.
Then, facts in hand, I was able to do the actually useful part… I synthesized some new ideas and wrote a paper.
Apparently, going through the act of finding the books, sorting through them, reading a lot of chaff and eventually finding the facts is an essential skill for an 11-year-old kid. And for a college sophomore. Essential enough to be responsible for 80% of the time they spend on the work itself?
Selecting the facts is an important part of the process. Finding them shouldn’t be.
I don’t know about you, but when I hire someone, or go to the doctor or the architect or an engineer, I could care less about how good they are at memorizing or looking up facts. I want them to be great at synthesizing ideas, the faster and more insightfully, the better.
Until just recently, law students had to learn a painstaking process to look up cases by hand. No longer. The academy realized that teaching students to be great at Lexis was a smart idea.
Please don’t tell me that Wikipedia isn’t a real encyclopedia or one that can’t be trusted. Perhaps it can’t be trusted if you’re prepping for a Presidential debate, but it is sure good enough to help me learn what I need to learn–which is how to quickly take a bunch of facts and turn them into a new and useful idea.
Here’s what just about every exam ought to be: ""Use Firefox to find the information you need to answer this question:"" And as the internet gets smarter, the questions are going to have to get harder. Which is a good thing.

Is viral marketing the same as word of mouth?,"I got a note from a college student last week, explaining that his professor told him he couldn’t use the term ‘viral marketing’ in a paper. It doesn’t exist, apparently, it’s just a new-fangled form of word of mouth.
I found the interaction fascinating (""I’m not certain what benefit is gained by arguing with an instructor"" is my favorite quote from his teacher) but I got to thinking about whether the instructor had a point.
""Viral marketing"" shows up 2,000,000 times in Google, ""ideavirus"" shows up 200,000 times. Of course, you could argue that just because millions of people are using a term doesn’t make it legitimate (though you’d be wrong).
Anyway…Viral marketing [does not equal] word of mouth.Here’s why:
Word of mouth is a decaying function. A marketer does something and a consumer tells five or ten friends. And that’s it. It amplifies the marketing action and then fades, usually quickly. A lousy flight on United Airlines is word of mouth. A great meal at Momofuku is word of mouth.
Viral marketing is a compounding function. A marketer does something and then a consumer tells five or ten people. Then then they tell five or ten people. And it repeats. And grows and grows. Like a virus spreading through a population. The marketer doesn’t have to actually do anything else. (They can help by making it easier for the word to spread, but in the classic examples, the marketer is out of the loop.) The Mona Lisa is an ideavirus.
This distinction is vital.
For one thing, it means that constant harassment of the population doesn’t increase the chances of something becoming viral. It means that most organizations should realize that they have a better chance with word of mouth (more likely to occur, more manageable, more flexible) and focus on that. And it means, most of all, that viral marketing is like winning the lottery, and if you’ve got a shot at anideavirus,you might as well over-invest and do whatever it takes to create something virus-worthy.
And yes, I happen to think that arguing with the instructor is a very good idea.",,"viral marketing, word of mouth, ideavirus"
Do you think they did it for the PR?,"Of course not.

"Meatball Mondae #4–No middlemen, no insulation","Perhaps the biggest change the new marketing brings is the easiest to overlook, mostly because it’s so obvious.
Every organization now has the ability (and probably the responsibility) to deal directly with the world. With customers, with prospects and with those impacted by their actions. No middlemen.
The president of the bank isn’t used to hearing from a customer about to lose her house. A retailer in Tucson isn’t used to hearing from a potential customer in Nebraska. A rock star is used to being entertained by A&R guys, not by maintaining a permission list of 100,000 customers and 55,000 MySpace friends.
This direct connection is an asset or a risk, depending on how you look at it.
The asset (the only asset, pretty much) that can be built online ispermission.The privilege of marketing to people who want to be marketed to. This asset is big enough and valuable enough to build an entire business around (witness Scott Adams and Amazon) and it upsets traditional power structures in just about every industry.
More important, it leads to the idea of ""no insulation.""
Sonosmakes a device that would have been inconceivable only ten years ago. The Sonos system is a remote control (with an LCD screen), a hard drive, and a box. The box hooks up to your stereo speakers, and the hard drive holds all your MP3 files. You can use the remote to review your entire music collection and play it anywhere in your house. Add more boxes, add more rooms. One hard drive can be used to let your daughter play Mahler in her room while you listen to Coldplay in the kitchen.
While the idea is simple, and installation is a snap, the products Sonos replaces weren’t simple or easy. As a result, multi-room speaker systems were sold by consultants—the sort of private services that cater to multimillionaires and their homes. At a recentCEDIAShow (the conference for installers), one of the categories was “Best Installation over £100,000.”
If you were in that business (companies like Runco and Stewart Filmscreen), you catered to the CEDIA installers. You let them be the middlemen, the service and support people, the installers, and yes, the folks that made most of the profit. The installers guided many of the decisions that their clients made, and you were at their mercy.
Sonos sells a product for about a thousand dollars. That’s less than the gratuity on most custom installations. As a result, Sonos decided to use the Web to allow consumers to interact with them directly.
In addition to a well-designed discussion board, Sonos invested in motivated, well-trained online staff members, who are seemingly everywhere, answering questions within a few minutes of them being asked. Sonos has pleasant technicians answering the phone on weekends. They not only publish their email address, but actually answer queries (and helpfully) in a matter of hours.
Of course, Sonos is still happy to work with the CEDIA crowd. But by embracing the ideas of accessibility and speed, they have made their product appealing to people who could easily afford to spend ten times as much.
How will their competition catch up? How can their competition simultaneously jettison their entire sales force, dramatically increase the quality of their customer service, lower their end pricing by 70%, and make the product consumer friendly? They can’t.
When everyone was playing by the same rules, when all suppliers relied on insulation in order to maintain margins and keep throughput efficient, it was a terrific system. But as soon as one player in the industry can use a direct connection to the end consumer, the rules change for everyone.[Find out moreabout this series.

Radiohead and the mediocre middle,"I got a ton of email this week about the Radiohead rollout. The short version: Radiohead (a million-selling rock band) launched their new album as a pay-what-you-want MP3 combined with an expensive boxed set. This is the sort thing I’ve beentalkingabout for seven years and many unknown bands have been doing for at least that long.
A lot of pundits have jumped in and talked about how this is the next big thing. That the music industry is finally waking up and realizing that they can’t change the world… that the world is changing them.
But that’s not the really useful insight here. The question is: why did it take so long, and why did we see it fromPrince(CD in the newspaper),Madonna($120 mm to leave her label and go to a concert promoter) and Radiohead?
Most industries innovate from both ends:
The mediocre record companies, mediocre A&R guys and the mediocre acts are struggling to stay in place. They’re nervous that it all might fall apart. So they wait. They wait for ‘proof’ that this new idea is going to work, or at least won’t prove fatal. (It’s the impulse to wait that made them mediocre in the first place, of course).
So, in every industry, the middle waits. And watches. And then, once they realize they can survive the switch (or once they’re persuaded that their current model is truly fading away), they jump in.
The irony, of course, is that by jumping in last, they’re condemning themselves to more mediocrity.","October 13, 2007","Radiohead, music industry, innovation"
The end of the poll,"For some reason, Americans love polls. We make very big decisions based on what we think everyone else is doing or going to do. I guess people don’t like to be ‘wrong’ even if wrong means doing what they believe in.
Gallup and others got very good at scientific polling. While traditional polls are often quite wrong when question bias or moving issues are at stake, they got pretty good at measuring conventional wisdom.
The web changes this. It changes this because polls done on the web are as far from scientific as possible (they don’t even measure what thewebthinks, never mind what everyone thinks) yet they are shrouded in the same respectability, the same graphs, the same nomenclature.
A web poll is nothing but a traffic stunt.
Which makes thisnotefrom Allen Wastler at CNBC so ridiculous. They ran a gimmicky poll, the results didn’t turn out the way they wanted so they took it down and snarkily blamed those that voted in the poll.
Polls aren’t going to go away. They make great traffic bait. But they are clearly sliding from their position of trust. (Which is just fine with me).",,"polls, web polling, trust"
Secular Christmas + Creativity = Halloween,"Christmas has always been the king of retail holidays in the US and it probably always will be. Many families spend 25% of their discretionary income each year on gifts and trinkets for the holiday.

Teaching your customers a lesson,"Meganpoints us to this photo of a package returned by the post office. For being less than 1% short on postage.

While monopolies can get away with this, you probably shouldn’t try. Yet businesses (and non-profits!) do it all the time.

Hey, it’s not the Supreme Court (fortunately). You’re not setting precedent every time you interact with someone.

How to create a great website,"Here are principles I think you can’t avoid:
1. Fire the committee. No great website in history has been conceived of by more than three people. Not one. This is a dealbreaker.
2. Change the interaction. What makes great websites great is that they are simultaneously effortless and new at the same time. That means that the site teaches you a new thing or new interaction or new connection, but you know how to use it right away. (Hey, if doing this were easy, everyone would do it.)
3. Less. Fewer words, fewer pages, less fine print.
4. What works, works. Theory is irrelevant.
5. Patience. Some sites test great and work great from the start. (Great if you can find one). Others need people to use them and adjust to them. At some point, your gut tells you to launch. Then stick with it, despite the critics, as you gain traction.
6. Measure. If you’re not improving, if the yield is negative… kill it.
7. Insight is good, clever is bad. Many websites say, “look at me.” Your goal ought to be to say, “here’s what you were looking for.”
8. If you hire a professional: hire a great one. The best one. Let her do her job. 10 mediocre website consultants working in perfect harmony can’t do the work of one rock star.

How to create a good enough website,"For most people, that’s all you need. A website that’s good enough. Not that breaks new ground, establishes a new identity, discovers new ways for people to interact online. Just a good enough website that didn’t kill you to launch.
To be clear, the following advice assumes that:
So, here’s what you do. First, realize that traditionally, the jobof designer has been linked with the job of programmer. There were verygood reasons for this. Designing a page that can’t work is silly, andchanging the design every time you change the way the page works can betime consuming and expensive.
As a result, web design became a sacred art, one done only by theblessed few, in caverns far away from where mortals tread. In addition,it became expensive, because design changes (which marketers love tomake) got in the same queue as programming changes.
We need to start by divorcing the two practices. There’s no longer areally good reason for the two to be so closely linked, especiallysince disciplined use of CSS and testing pays such dividends.
Start with design. Don’t involve the programming team until you’re90% done with the look and feel of your pages. It’s cheap to changedesign if it can’t by supported by programming, and cheaper and fasterto have design done in Photoshop before you commit to cutting it up andcoding it.
I’m going to go out on a limb and beg younotto create an originaldesign. There are more than a billion pages on the web. Surely there’sone that you can start with? If your organization can’t find a website that you all agree can serve as a model, you need to stop right now and find a new job.
Not a site to rip-off, but an inspiration. Fonts and colors and layout. The line spacing. The interactions. Whynot? Your car isn’t unique, and your house might not be either. Ifyou’ve got a site that sells 42 kinds of wrapping paper, why not startby finding a successful site that sells… I don’t know, shoes oryo-yo’s… something that both appeals to your target audience and hasbeen tested and tweaked and works. No, don’t pick a competitor. Thatwill get you busted. Pick a reasonably small but successful site in atotally different line of work. Say to your designer: ""That’s ourstarting point. Don’t change any important design element withoutasking me first. Now, pull in our products, our logo and our companycolor scheme and let’s take a look at it.""
At this point, some people are aghast! Shouldn’t the web be a design contest on top of everything else? I don’t think so.
Now, take your finished Photoshop pages and get every single personwho can possibly veto your project to say okay. THEN give it toengineering to make it work.
[Boy, am I in trouble. People hate posts like this one. They read all sorts of things into it that I don’t intend. I’m certainly not against bespoke design, or designers. I certainly don’t believe that all engineers are bad designers or even difficult to deal with. The point of the post is most definitelynotto encourage you to commit copyright violations or even ethical ones. It merely works to recognize two things:
1. If you are unable to agree on an existing site, you are sure going to spend a lot of time and money trying to agree on a custom one.
2. The process of design and user interaction is best done separately from the process of server speed, database structure and uptime.

Meatball Mondae #3 (Columbus Day Edition),"Google and Discovery
Google and the other search engines have broken the world into little tiny bits. No one visits a Web site’s home page anymore—they walk in the back door, to just the place Google sent them. By atomizing the world, Google destroys the end-to-end solution offered by most organizations, replacing it with a pick-and-choose, component-based solution.
Columbus is the center of a popular fable about discovery. He set out to find something, got lost along the way and instead gets credit for an ever bigger find. The analogy of the web is pretty much a stretch, but here goes: people don’t always find you the way you want to be found.
Not only are there literally a million ways to discover you and your offerings, but rarely people hear your story the way you want it to be heard. The idea of a home page and a site map and a considered, well-lit entryway to your brand is quaint but unrealistic.

The means that bundling is harder than ever.
Bundling was the glue that held together almost every business and organization.
Bundle donations and parcel them out to charities that deserve them. (That’s the United Way).
Bundle TV shows and present them, with ads, on your TV network.
Bundle the items in your industrial supplies catalog and hand it to the business buyer.
Bundle thirty businesses and house them in one big office tower.
The Yellow Pages is a multibillion-dollar business that consists of nothing but bundled ads for local businesses. No one wants to keep a flyer for every business in town, but everyone has a copy of the Yellow Pages.
Book publishers bundle authors and share the expertise of their staff, their sales force, and their capital in order to bring books to readers.

Thinking outside the (eBay) search box,"More than a million people sell on eBay regularly, and by someestimates, more than half a million people do it as their full-time job.
The prevailing wisdom is this:
So, a prospect goes to eBay, types in ""Elmo"" and sees all thelistings. Common sense tells the prospect to find the cheapest one froman acceptably rated bidder. The end result is average stuff sold toaverage people for slightly below average prices. The long tail kicksin and there’s a business! eBay does its share by putting a part of itsprofits to work in promotion and in affiliate programs and in ads onGoogle, etc.
You, loyal reader, can already guess what’s coming:average stuff for average people is no way to make a living.In fact, the big eBay success stories, the ones that people talk about, are theAlan Greenspan paintings, thegrilled cheesesandwich that looks like the Virgin Mary, or the woman who sold thePokemoncards for a fortune, etc. In other words, buzzable stuff. Unique stuff.Remarkable stuff. Stuff that got sold despite the search box, notbecause of it.
That’s all fine if you’re running a circus sideshow, but what aboutthe hundreds of thousands of people that just want to sell typicalstuff and don’t have great copywriting talent? They need a differentstrategy, one that gets them attention off eBay and builds an assetthey can profit from.
7 years ago I helped a friend at Yahoo by writing a short book aboutthe short-lived Yahoo auctions business. I argued that the assetsellers should build is permission. That the way to make a living as aseller on eBay is to have a list of people who want to get a weekly ormonthly email from you outlining your latest and greatest auctions. Andto do that, you need a specialty, you need to be real and you need tobe trusted.
If I collected Fiestaware, for example, I’d look forward to anupdate from a trusted source on her (and everyone else’s) Fiestawareauctions, sorted by desirability.
Instead of running a rolling garage sale, you need to become anexpert. Someone who is seen as knowing what they’re talking about, andsomeone who can reach out to possible buyers instead of waiting forthem to find you.
I’m selling my treasuredcanoeon eBay. Without this blog, it’s really unlikely that I’d get even abid or two on it. Of course, if every eBay seller had a blog like mine, they’dbe fine, because they could just post their auctions as I just did, andthey’d get plenty of traffic. But building thousands of blog posts overnearly a decade is a lot of investment just to sell a canoe.
For the seller who doesn’t have that asset,we’ve just launched SquidBids.
Here’s thepageI built about my canoe auction.
It doesn’t work so well if you’re doing what I’m doing, which isselling just one item. But imagine that someone decides to specializein antique teaspoons or even bulldog puppies… the idea is to build ablog, a twitter following, a FaceBook social graph, and even aSquidBids page that:
The goal, to make a really long post short, is to create an environment where people will pay extra because it’syouwho’s doing the selling. And that happens when you give your audiencethings. Give them information and access and insight. Point to auctionsthat aren’t even yours… if it’s good stuff.
This feels hard. It takes time. But it’s far far easier and more profitable then wishing and hoping that someone stumbles onto you. If selling on eBay is actually your business, you need to start setting out the breadcrumbs that make you worth more than the next guy.

The tools: when you give a kid a net connection, access to wikipedia and to the rest of the world, things change fast. Things you wouldn’t necessarily predict. Like a ten year old who can diagnose his dad’s illness. Or a farmer that can ask his daughter to find out where to get a new part for the tractor. Or…
The bravery: When Nicholas Negroponte and his team started this project, they had nothing but obstacles. The status quo of software and hardware and skeptics stood firmly in his way. And he took a lot of grief for the effort. Even when you’re doing nothing but good, fear of change is going to cause a lot of people to object.
The marketing: Everything, even laptops for kids, works its way through the innovation diffusion curve. That means that most countries, most organizations and most communities aren’t going to adopt this tool for a few years. It doesn’t matter if it’s perfect… these things take time. Smart marketing embraces the curve and doesn’t insist that it must change for this project, right now.

Thinking about Bizdev,Some ideas to get you started:,,"Bizdev, ideas, strategy"
Business development,"A friend of mine wears only Armani eye glasses.
Of course, the glasses aren’t actually made by Armani. Or, if you think about it, designed by him. Perhaps they’re sold by Armani stores, but I’d guess most of them are sold in stores that are totally unrelated to the company.
So what, exactly, explains the success of the line?
Licensing, affiliates, franchises, partnerships, traffic exchanges, joint ventures and co-promotions live in a netherworld. While they are all important marketing techniques, they often come under the rubric of business development, a department where there is little structure and few rules.
Bizdev is hard, but worth it. Hard because there’s no ‘retail’ deals. If I want to license the Armani name I can’t just pick up the phone, get a rate card and use it. No, it takes months or even years. In most cases, there isn’t even an easy way to figure out who to talk with.
So most marketers avoid it altogether. Don’t you think that Pop Tarts filled with Kraft cheese singles would be a hit? (They’d taste terrible, but kids and harried moms would go wild.) So why not a simple licensing deal or joint venture? Because there’s no such thing as simple in this industry.
Take a look at the growth of the web. Most companies end up doing it solo, when it would have been so much easier to grow in concert. My friend Dev worked on a company that figured it could make money on the clickafteryou bought something from a store. That’s a wasted page anyway… you just finished buying, the page says thanks and you go somewhere else. Wouldn’t it be great to just put that page to work? Sure, but doing that deal isn’t so easy.

Data vs. Software,"The last ten years online have been breathtaking, not because of software (which isn’t much better) but because the treasure trove of data keeps getting better and better. Wikipedia, all by itself, is worth the price of admission.
This site gives a glimpse of theamazing collection of fixes and addonsyou can find for Firefox and other browsers. I highly recommend it. I can only marvel, though at how hard it is to do some things online. Why can’t I, in one click, grab all the links on a page and save them as a text file?
While I’m at it, I think we’re on the edge of two big software breakthroughs. The first is programs that live on the web instead of your desktop (I know, we’ve heard a lot about how this is the next big thing, but it’s almost here) and second is in desktop software that is truly web-aware. That knows the definitions of words. That can update and correct and conform my address book. It’s all still lousy, all still in the dark ages, but there are glimmers of hope.
For now, the data is far far ahead of the tools.
PS Randy came through with the magic tweak I asked for above. Really nice of him, though of course it shouldn’t be bespoke! If it’s something you’ve been wanting to do, here’s how: First, make a bookmark. Second, go edit the bookmark by hitting ""organize bookmarks"". Change the URL to this: javascript:(function(){as = document.getElementsByTagName(""a""); str =""""; for (i=0; i<as.length; i++) { str += as[i].href+""<br>\n"" }with(window.open()){document.write(str); document.close();}})()    that’s it, done. And Joost just sent a clickable version:  javascript:(function(){as=document.getElementsByTagName(""a"");str=""<ul>"";for(i=0;i<as.length;i++){str+=""<li><a href=""+as[i].href+"">""+as[i].href+""</a></li>\n""}str+=""</ul>"";with(window.open()){document.write(str);document.close();}})() Whenever you hit that bookmark, it’ll open a new window with all your links on it.","October 1, 2007","Data, Software, Web Tools"
Meatball Mondae (#2),"Talking ’bout a revolution…
Everyone studies the industrial revolution in school but most of us don’t really understand it. The basic idea, it seems, is that Henry Ford, Eli Whitney and some guy with rifles invented the assembly line and the whole world changed in about a week.
Actually, we’ve had several industrial revolutions over the last 250 years. While the assembly line, the invention of the corporation and improvements in transport appear to be the obvious causes, it’s easy to forget that in just a few generations we saw changes in every element of what it meant to be in business. Standardized quality control, innovative product design for utilitarian products, employees (!), branding, investment, advertising, insurance, product development… the list is miles long.
Why care?
Because just sixty years ago, there was another revolution. This one was caused by the triumph of mass marketing. General Foods, General Motors and the rest of the consumer-focused Fortune 500 are organized around a single idea: that efficient factories making average stuff for average people could triumph.
GM had a great run. So did tons of other companies. They figured out how to make stuff in large quantities. Run big factories. Hire and manage large numbers of people. The age of advertising ushered in a revolution that had more impact on organizations (and the planet) than any that came before it.
TheMeatball Sundaeis an idea that’s possibly even bigger than that one. When mass marketing dies, the future of the companies that embrace this approach dies too. We’re living through a wholesale change, but all most of us can do is worry about the color of the links on our blogs.
TheMeatball Sundaehas a subtle but subversive lesson: change the media, and the organizations change too. Kiva instead of the American Heart Association, Amazon instead of the local bookstore, MoveOn instead of the DNC.
We’re spending a ton of time arguing about tactics, social networks and adwords. Behind the scenes, an even bigger revolution is brewing. It’s the one where entire organizations change in response to the lever of the change in marketing. Henry Ford could have said, ""we’re all manufacturers"" and been right. Today, we can say, ""we’re all marketers,"" and we will be just as right.
Every time the deck is reshuffled, the early players profit. You and I don’t have the chance to build a mass media company ever again. But every organization has the chance to reinvent and grow in the face of the huge opportunity today’s shift brings.
This sounds hard. It’s not. Once you understand the key forces at work (I figure there are about 14 of them) it’s actually easier to gowiththe flow than it is to fight it.
This is way too conceptual for a blog post or even a useful book, so I guess I’ll ask the question this way: If you were alive in 1947 and knew what you know now about the last sixty years of mass marketing, what would you have done? What would you have built?Was it just about making better TV commercials?

That doesn’t make sense,"Ben has apostabout a beer made by an order of monks in Belgium. These monks, who have taken vows of silence, only sell the beer by appointment, don’t label the bottles, and severely limit the supply they create. As you can imagine for a beer that some call the best in the world, it has quite a cult following.
There are two ingredients to this remarkability. The first, as Ben points out, is the idea of ritual. By changing the way the product is created and distributed, they add a religious and spiritual element to the process (even if they weren’t monks). Second, they’re not trying to sell themost.That’s critical.
When you try to maximize anything, you work to be efficient, to fit in, to appeal to the average person, since that’s where the numbers are.

The room was dead. People were sprawled over the chairs. One guy had his head down. Others were facing away from the speaker or checking their iPhones.
They didn’t think of themselves as marketers in that moment, but of course, they were. They were marketing themselves to the speaker as uninterested, tired and hard to reach. They probably got very little back in the way of increased energy or enthusiasm from the person they ostensibly came to hear.
Every time you walk into a meeting, agree to sit in on a sales call, do a job interview or have a conversation with a consultant, you’re marketing.

What fascinates me is thatonline-onlyretailers do better closer to Xmas, but the online outposts of brick and mortar stores (like JC Penney) do betterearlier.Translation: the Penney’s and Target customers don’t ‘get’ the whole fast-shipping thing, because when they think of traditional stores, they think slow. The Amazon customer has been spoiled, and in addition to one-click, is now trained to wait until the last minute.
The funny thing is that this is precisely backward what it was just five or ten years ago. Mail order was slow, last minute was for local.

The caricature of your brand,"Coryhas a post that points out research demonstrating that police have better luck finding suspects using caricatures than boring sketches.
A caricature falsely highlights various anomalies while diminishing the boring parts. So Jay Leno gets a ridiculous chin, or Jimmy Durante gets an even bigger nose (okay, he had a pretty big nose).
The same is true for your brand, but even more so. The best brands are caricatures of their true selves. Yes, they must have exceptional ‘features’ (a step that’s easy to skip, but without which leads to failure) but then, over time, those features become a caricature. During the formative days of Fedex, the caricature was that their drivers would even rent a helicopter to get just one package delivered on time. It’s easy to turn Starbucks’ variety and focus on your needs into a caricature as well, ""half-caf, extra hot, short macchiato, extra foam, with soy, in a ceramic mug….""
As Nixon discovered, when the caricature becomes negative, it’s almost impossible to escape (glad I’m not Bob Nardelli or a shareholder at Topps hamburgers). Worse than avoiding the negative, though, is the tendency for most organizations to resist creating a brand that can be caricatured. It doesn’t feel safe or responsible or prudent. Coloring inside the lines and pleasing most of your customers most of the time almost guarantees you’ll be bland.

They’re tearing down a classic diner in New Rochelle, NY and putting up a Walgreen’s drugstore, right next to an existing CVS. The diner’s fans are up in arms. Not to worry, the NYTimesreports. Here’s the key quote, unedited:
""Joel Sachs, a lawyer for the developers, said that Walgreens has realized from the beginning that the diner was an icon in the community and would be a sensitive tenant.""
Sensitive?Does that meant that the Walgreens is going to serve bacon? Or does it mean nothing whatsoever?
It would certainly be more truthful to say, ""hey, it’s our right to put up a Walgreens. If you don’t like it, you should rent the space instead."" But that would be inflammatory, so it’s easier to just spin, I guess.
[Two people have pointed out that my ‘quote’ is a paraphrase. It’s entirely possible that Mr. Sachs didn’t say anything about being a sensitive tenant. If that’s the case, I’m just plain wrong. But (in this case, anyway) I don’t think I am.]","November 25, 2007","lies, development, community"
Cowboy Junkies Paradox,"Twenty years ago,the Cowboy Junkiesreleased close to a perfect breakthrough album. It sold a bazillion copies.
Every since, they’ve been touring, making a living on the road as they’ve released almost twenty records, none of them monster hits in the US. The paradox occurs at their concerts… when they play one of the old hits, the crowd goes wild. The people most likely to come to their concerts are the ones most likely to encourage them to become an oldies act. Of course, once the group does that, people are going to stop showing up.
Marketers of all stripes face the same challenge. Your current customers want nothing but the old stuff, but the new customers don’t know you exist, so they can’t speak up.
[Clarification! I love the Junkies. I saw them last night. They were spectacular… I own more than half their twenty CDs and you should too… my point, which was defeated by brevity, is that thefanscreate the paradox.

Because they like it. It feels special. They are somehow earning the discount. The store creates discomfort and then profits from it. And the customers save money…
Southwest did the same thing to load their planes. By getting rid of boarding passes, they create a small sense of panic. People line up and push and shove to get on the plane in the mistaken belief that somehow they won’t get on.

The challenge is… what if you had to charge 7%. What if you had to charge more when everyone else was charging less?
What would you do? How could you make it worth it?
Now, just imagine what would happen if you did that at 6% or even 5%? You’d be unstoppable.

"Meatball Mondae, again… this time it’s about the wealthy","Rich people used to all be the same,just different from the rest of us. Now they’re not only different fromthe rest of us, but different from each other.Rich people usedto do similar jobs, wear similar clothes, live in similarneighborhoods, and read similar magazines. As a result, marketing torich people was pretty easy. No longer. As the gulf between rich andpoor continues to widen, the number of people considered rich increasesdaily, and the diversity of the rich increases as well.
[Byrich,I mean people with enough money to buy what you sell].
It turnsout that not only are the wealthy like us, they are us. Despite thewidening gulf between rich and poor, there are more wealthy people than ever before. In fact,you’re probably one of them. Michael Silverstein and Neil Fiske of BCGtalked about this in their bookTrading Up, and the trend has onlybecome more pervasive.

You won’t find me on Amazon’s new book reader,"Newsweek has all the details righthere.
I’ve been hyperventilating about Amazon becoming a book publisher since at least 1998. That’s the juicy part of the business… finding writers for your readers as much as you spend time finding readers for other people’s writers. A book costs about a dollar or two to print and sells for $20… Lots of room there for Amazon to integrate the process, to find long tail successes, to match hidden needs with authors needing promotion.
Kindle, the code name for their new ebook reader, gives them a platform where they can actually begin to be a publisher (though for now, they’re resorting to acting like a low-paid middleman, once again leaving short-sighted publishers to cripple a new medium).
When Amazon came to talk to me about being included on the reader a long long time ago, I said sure,but.
The but is that I wanted my books to be free and included in every reader, and my blog, too.
The beauty of real books is that they don’t require a reader, which means that millions of people are eligible members of the market. Even if you only have .0001% market share, you can still get your book read.
The challenge that my hero Jeff Bezos has is that if he’s really really lucky, he’ll sell a million of these things in a year. And that means that at $10 a book, you need to have significant market share to make an impact. The Sony reader has been out for months and it has sold, perhaps, a few thousand units.
My thought was to use it, at least for a few years, as a promotion device. Give the books for free to anyone who buys the $400 machine. (Maybe you can have 1,000 books of your choice, so there’s not a lot of ‘waste’.) You’ll sell more machines that way, that’s for sure. And the people willing to buy the device are exactly the sort of people that an author like me wants to reach. No harm, no foul, all three of us win. If there were a million of these machines out there and an author had a chance to have her next book show up automatically on all of them, few among us would say, ""no thanks to that exposure.""
This is a disruptive approach, the sort of thing only a market leader could pull off. It changes the world in a serious way. I wanted to be part of that.
I was unpersuasive. Sorry.","November 18, 2007","Amazon, ebook reader, publishing"
Saying goodbye,"The restaurant in town closed about six months ago. For weeks, there was a sign about renovations. Then a new sign, this one promising big things. Then, of course, the ""for rent"" sign from the broker.
A software service I used for a while sent me a note today that read:
Please note that the service has reached end of life and is scheduled to be decommissioned on Monday, December 3rd.  Once the service has been taken down, all content will be deleted.  It is very important that you transfer your data to another service provider prior to this date to avoid data loss.
That’s it. The entire note.
One last example: someone I hired a while ago changed her mind after the first day. She never showed up again. Didn’t answer calls or email. Just vanished. Not dead, just a chicken.

The end of misogyny?,"For as long as I can remember, marketers have been using misogyny to sell products, get votes and attract viewers.
It’s sort of astonishing… in my lifetime, we’ve seen the end of public (but certainly not private) attacks on people because of race or mainstream religion (fringe beliefs and sexual orientation are still fair game, apparently)… but trying to humiliate half the population because of their gender seems just fine.
That may be changing. There’s a significant backlash about John McCain’shandlingof a question earlier in the week. If the questioner had used a similar epithet about a black person or someone from Poland, they would have been shown the door. At least I hope so.
And now Robert Greenwald has put together a really disturbing (NSFW)videoof misogyny and pornography as broadcast on Fox News.
As Hugh Hefner demonstrated with Playboy fifty years ago, objectifying women was a shortcut to cash. And all you have to do is visit Las Vegas to see it happening in every hallway, on every billboard. What is now becoming clear is that many of the people in your market won’t stand for it any longer.

The associate would be primarily responsible for using the internet, video, and a range of tools available for building community to share what Acumen Fund is learning about effective ways to bring critical goods and services to people living in the developing word who make less than $3 per day.  Acumen Fund wants to engage a wide range of communities in our work, and will reach out to those that care about social entrepreneurship, strategic philanthropy, and solving the problem of global poverty.
Experience building on-line communities or working in communications, media, or video would certainly be beneficial in the role; however we are also looking for someone who is a self-starter and eager to learn new skills and bring their creativity to the work.

The $8 billion story/scam,"In case you had any doubt that human beings are irrational creatures, driven by stories, consider the case of the gift card.
Christmas has become a holiday about shopping, not about giving. Case in point: the $100 gift card, now available from banks, from stores, even in a rack at the supermarket.
Last year, more than $8,000,000,000 was wasted on these cards. Not in the value spent, but in fees and breakage. When you give a card, if it doesn’t get used, someone ends up keeping your money, and it’s not the recipient. People spent more than eight billion dollars for nothing… buying a product that isn’t as good as cash.
Along the way, we bought the story that giving someone a hundred dollar bill as a gift (""go buy what you want"") is callous, insensitive, a crass shortcut. Buying them a $100 Best Buy card, on the other hand, is thoughtful. Even if they spend $92 and have to waste the rest.
The interesting thing about stories is that the inconsistent ones don’t always hold up to scrutiny. Consumer Reports and others are trying to spread a different story. One that sounds like this:
Gift cards are for chumps.
If enough people talk about this new story, people will be embarrassed to give a gift card. It’s a waste. It’s a scam. It’s a trap for the recipient.
The irony is that the gift card companies could easily spend, say, half the profits and create a wonderful, better story… where every $100 gift card also generates two or three dollars for a worthy cause. That would resonate with a lot of people… But I think it’s unlikely.
If I were a creative non-profit, I’d start marketing alternative gift cards. They would consist of PDF files you could print out and hand over to people when you give them cash. It could say,
""Merry Christmas. Here’s your present, go spend it on what you really want. AND, just to make sure we’re in the right holiday spirit, I made a donation in your name to Aworthycause.""
Stories come and go. It’s up to marketers to spread the good ones.","November 15, 2007","gift cards, consumer behavior, holiday shopping"
Conceal vs. Reveal,"Marketing spends a lot of time concealing things.
Take this box of Whole Wheat Ritz crackers. The #1 ingredient? White flour.
Or consider the fine print read in a hurry at the end of the car ad or the fact that most bottled water comes from the tap… Most contracts are designed to conceal as much as to reveal, which is one reason lawyers get a bad rap.
If you set out to conceal as a marketer (airbrushing a photo, leading with your strengths, staying within the letter if not the spirit of the law) it's easy to invent creative new ways to achieve your goals. It sure feels as though you can stay ahead of the game.
A different technique is starting to gain traction, though. Working to reveal instead of conceal. My fish monger in Grand Central has started placing signs in front of each fish. They describe exactly where the fish came from, whether it's healthy and how endangered it is. You'll never see fine print saying ""previously frozen."" They don't have any fine print. The first few times you visit the stand, it's actually off putting. It takes the romance and pleasure out of buying the fish, because you realize that there's a cost to it. The meat guy across the way doesn't have pictures of cows being slaughtered, does he?
But after a while, because the information is out there, because smart fish buyers already know some fish is endangered, the signs give you power. They allow you to make smart choices. They send a message to the customer about the honesty and intent of the seller. They build trust.
Once you embrace the idea of revealing as much as you can (consider Amazon's policy of selling the cheaper used copies right next to the new ones, as well as featuring ads from competitors on the same page) it's a lot easier to live and thrive online.

Who pays the messenger?,"In just about every business, the last mile accounts for the bulk of the cost of the service or good being sold. Retailers get half. Insurance people get commissions. Distributors make their share.
When the internet drove the cost of some things to zero, the equation could change, because you don’t need to pay a messenger when your offer is so irresistible. So, free email could be free not just because it’s so cheap to run and because you have ad revenue, but because you don’t need much of a marketing effort to get the word out.
As we enter a new stage of post-industrial businesses, it’s easy to forget to build in the cost of the messenger. A great idea isn’t a great idea unless you can pay someone to help you spread it, to help you overcome our natural inclination to ignore you or to say ""no,"" purely out of habit.
If you’re not going to plan on paying the messenger, your offering better be so remarkable and have such a viral story that your investment in product eliminates the need for media and sales.","November 13, 2007","Last mile, cost of service, marketing effort"
Meatball Mondae week 9: The Long Tail,"[Somehow, this post disappeared. I’m trying again!]
Byitself, a bias for choice is interesting but not particularlysurprising. What’s surprising is the magnitude of this desire. Myfavorite example is the comparison of a typical Barnes & Noblestore with Amazon. If you examine the sales of the 150,000 titles in abig store, you’ll see that they account for perhaps half of Amazon’sbook sales. In other words, if you aggregate the millions of poorlyselling titles on Amazon, they add up to the total sales of all thebestselling books in the physical world put together.
Anotherway of looking at it: More people watched more video on YouTube lastweek than watched the top ten shows on network television.
Anotherway: A quick look at your grocer’s beverage aisle will prove to youthat Coca-Cola is no longer the most popular soft drink in the country.The most popular soft drink is ""other"": none of the above.
The mass of choices defeats the biggest hit.
Thiscurve shows up over and over. It describes travel habits, DVD rentals,and book sales. Give people a choice and the tail always gets longer.Always.
The Long Tailhas been around forever, but only now does it really matter. That’s because of several trends working together:
a. Online shopping gives the retailer the ability to carry a hundred times the inventory of a typical retail store.
b. Google means that a user can find something if it’s out there.
c. Permission marketing gives sellers the freedom to find products for their customers, instead of the other way around.
d. Digital products are easy to store and easy to customize.
e. Digital technology makes it easy to customize non-digital goods.

What brand is your mattress?,"According to aTimesinterview with the head of Tempurpedic, you don’t know.
That’s how they built a built a billion dollar company. By getting 2% of a market that doesn’t care about brands to care about them. A typical marketer looks at this and says, ""great marketing! You branded a product in an unbranded marketplace.""
I actually don’t think that’s what really happened. I think what happened is that every single product in the mattress market was perceived as the same, so there was no reason to care about which brand, because, frankly, it didn’t seem to matter. Like brands of gasoline or milk.
Many marketers are excited about a brand-free market. They walk in wads of cash and try to buy share. They believe that the brand can build the product. That’s backwards.
When you change the product enough, branding happens.
There are two traps here:
first, entering a brand-free market where people have been trained to ignore the various competitors is really expensive, because people aren’t listening, no matter how great your offer is. I think Tempurpedic got a little lucky.
and
second, believing that you can have the brandbeforeyou have the product. You almost certainly don’t have the money to pull that off.
He also said that 95% of his customers have recommended his product to others. Not the brand, not the experience, but the product. I have, it’s true.

“A potential spoiler”,"Here’s a quick way for the mainstream media to enrage people: In aNew York Timesreview of Ron Paul’s latest TV commercial, Julie Bosman concludes, ""The advertisement accomplishes what the Paul campaign said was its modest goal: to introduce Mr. Paul to voters in that state, where he is emerging as a potential spoiler in the Republican primary.""
But this isn’t a post about politics, it’s about spoiling things.
When you’re trying to sell something new, particularly in a business to business setting, there are always people like Julie Bosman. They are the defenders of the status quo.
They have an important job to do: to point out to everyone the risks of change. To identify potential spoilers.
You don’t have to like Ron Paul’s politics to be annoyed at this (I’m not voting for him), particularly if you’re an agent of change, someone who tries to sell growth or new ideas or even a product.
The thing is, being annoyed at it doesn’t do you any good at all. The status quo police aren’t going to go away, and in fact, they are often a big help in that most of your competition is held at bay by them.
So, how do you persuade the status quo police to stop treating you like a potential spoiler? You don’t. I don’t think you have a prayer. Instead, you create an environment where her colleagues and her family persuade her.
The establishment didn’t like the microcomputer (the president of Digital Computer thought it was dumb), the iPod or even Nike sneakers. The establishment didn’t like Jimmy Carter’s chances the first time out either. You can spend all your time selling the establishment, or you can just work around them.

The Seth Godin Boxed Set,"I’ve been playing with this idea for about eight months and it’s just about ready. I’m really pleased at the finished product.
I’ve never offered a video or a training product, despite the fact that I get asked about it a lot. I figured (pre-glasses) that it was time to give it a try.
These DVD products usually run about 45 minutes and sell for $900 to a thousand dollars. I thought I’d try something a little different. In addition to my seminar, I wanted to add some other elements that make it more interesting and useful to a wider audience.
I’m producing a four DVD set.
The first DVD includes a full speech I did in Denver in March, along with an hour-long interview with Charlie Rose. The next three DVDs include six hours of informal Q&A from a seminar I did this fall. Eight hours of me (heaven forfend!) and the price is $800. $100 an hour, more if you nap.
I’m going into production now and I realize that I have no idea how many to make. So, here’s the deal:
If you’re interested in buying a set for your company,click here and drop me an email.I won’t bill you or even make you promise you’ll actually cough up the money. But I will add you to a list and alert you when it’s ready, and I’ll use your note to guesstimate the interest. I’ll keep the email lines open for two weeks and then let everyone who responded know what’s up. All I need is your contact info… it’s not for correspondence, please.
You get the rights to watch the thing as often as you like, and to show it to groups as large as 30. It’s pretty clear I can’t visit as many places as I’d like in order to give my seminar, so this is a chance to go places without flying. Not included are the rights to do large group presentations or to post it on a public or private server. Unfortunately, it’s not an erasable DVD, so you can’t delete me and put Seinfeld on instead.

FaceBook’s Hotmail problem,"Real old-timers remember Hotmail. They came out of nowhere to become a massive ideavirus. growing exponentially and then selling to Microsoft for more than $400 million (in cash).
And yet Microsoft has never ever come close to making a profit on this. Why?
Because Hotmail trained users not to click on the ads. The last thing you want to do while checking your email is to stop doing that and read some ads, or to click away to another site.
The mistake Hotmail made? Not building a permission asset. What if registration gave you a choice of 5 or 10 or 1,000 different newsletters you could get for free every week. (Pick one for your free membership, or pick as many as you want). And what if every newsletter was filled with actual news and plenty of free samples, gift certificates and big time savings directly related to your topic?
Most people would look forward to the newsletter. The ads would be a bonus, not a penalty.
When someone goes to FaceBook, they’re not looking for stuff. They’re looking for people. But people don’t buy ads, stuff does.
That’s a problem.
Any platform that makes ads a distraction or a cost is always going to fail compared to a site where the ads are a welcome part of the deal.

In the new transparent age, it’s really difficult to tell two stories simultaneously.
Why George Allen won’t be running for president:
It was a greatWeb moment. George Allen was the Republican Party’s next star, anointedas a potential candidate for president in 2008. But first he had to winthe Senate race in Virginia, considered by many to be a layup for him.
Thetraditional way to run a political campaign is to control your message.Control what you say and when you say it. Control who hears it.
Tell one story to your raving fans, and a more moderate story to people in the center.
Asvoters have seen again and again, politicians are good at this. Somepeople call it lying. But in general, politicians have gotten away withit.
The top-down, control-the-message strategy worked in the past for a few reasons:
ButGeorge Allen discovered that the rules have fundamentally changed.Allen’s challenger asked S.R. Sidarth, a senior at the University ofVirginia, to trail Allen with a video camera. The idea was to documentAllen’s travels and speeches. During a speech in Breaks, Virginia,Allen turned to Sidarth and said, “Let’s give a welcome to Macaca,here. Welcome to America and the real world of Virginia,” said Allen.As I write this, YouTube reports that Allen’s slur has been watched onYouTube more than 318,000 times. Add to that the pickup from thebroadcast media (which picked it up because it was popular, not becauseit was “important”), and you see why George Allen lost the election.
Theironic part of the appearance is that the first words out of Allen’smouth on the tape are, “Ladies and Gentlemen, we’re going to runpositive campaign.” The story didn’t match the facts, and the factsshowed up on YouTube.
Summary for nor non-politicians: You can’t tell two stories at the same time. Not for long.

What is the ‘live web’?,"You didn’t realize it, but just about everything you do online is asynchronous.

There are a few reasons for this. The biggest one is this: TV works as a live medium because millions watch just a few channels. The web needs to be asynchronous because there are too many channels! If you had to be ‘tuned in’ to see a blog post or read an email (the way you need to be tuned in to catch a live phone call or hear something on a police scanner) you’d miss too much.
Technology in the form of fast enough bandwidth is combining with a bigger audience to create live pockets online now. Thisblog feed, for example. This post was on it at 7:36 EST, but you missed it.
Watch for more live stuff. It’ll probably happen in places where there are clearly defined and very motivated audiences, and in pockets where there is so much value to be gained by monitoring the live feed on the web or your phone (like stock news or leftover tickets) that it’s worth your attention.","November 3, 2007","live web, asynchronous, online audience"

How can you change your game?
Consider the plight of Mike Huckabee and John Edwards. Both are making strong runs for the nominations of their parties, but both  suffer because they’re not seen as front runners. So why not change the game? Instead of waiting for a TV network to invite them to a debate, why not make your own TV show? Debate each other, in public, in Iowa. Broadcast the whole thing on YouTube. When you’re done, challenge others in the opposite party to debate you, one on one. On your channel. What are they, chicken?
Consider the sandwich/burger shop/deli on a street crowded with choices. What to do? Why not get rid of all the meat and become a vegetarian/kosher sandwich/burger shop/deli?

"Marketer of the year, 2007","It’s a tie. Two marketers, same category.
My criteria:
Both winners built world-famous brands in less than a year of effort. Both paid for their marketing largely through self-liquidating campaigns on the web itself. And neither one of them has a job you will ever likely have. Which makes it even easier to learn from their work as marketers.
In two days we find out if either one of them actually built a marketing campaign that worked. It really doesn’t matter, though. The fact that they’ve gotten this far (with diametrically opposed points of view, by the way) is proof that this marketing thing isn’t just a fad.
You’ve probably guessed my two winners: Ron Paul and Barack Obama. Who would have guessed two years ago that without much help at all from the establishment, either would be where they are today? That’s the power of the new marketing.

Nickel and diming,"If you run a business that’s ""all inclusive"" (like a buffet, a resort, a membership organization or even a consulting practice) you really only have two ways to increase your profits.
The first wayis to figure out how to get more money out of each customer. That means a surcharge on the special lobster appetizer or a small extra fee for better service. It means coming up with ways to not actually be ""all inclusive"", to give the customer less unless they pay you more.
The goal of this method is to come up with goods and services that have a low marginal cost (your cost of getting or delivering one more) and a high marginal value (what it’s worth to the customer). So, if you can charge the best members of your club a $500 fee for attending a networking event that only costs you $3 a person to host, you’re going to see a large increase in profit.
The second wayis to figure out how to give your customers more. To be even more ""all inclusive"" than the competition. To find countless items of low marginal cost and just include them. Why? Because it creates return visits from your existing base, and even better, is a significant investment in word of mouth, the most effective marketing available to you.
The Beaches resort in Jamaica prides itself on great people (true) and on being totally all inclusive (not so true). I was there for a few days for a family reunion and it was pretty clear to me that an MBA on a mission was at work. The nickel and diming adds up. He had scoured the place to find ways to charge just a little (or a lot) more as often as possible.
Wifi is a great example. The marginal cost of hosting one more person on a wifi network is as close to zero as something can be. Charge people more than $10 a day and suddenly you’re making hundreds or thousands of dollars of extra profit. Or promise free scuba, but charge people $70 for a checkout course before you let them dive… low marginal cost, high incremental profit.
I have no doubt that this works in the short run. It might even work out to be a viable marketing strategy in some markets. However, the alternative is worth considering.Not only do everything you say you’re going to do, but do more.
Offering low marginal cost items for free is a shortcut to generating word of mouth, which is a lot cheaper than buying ads.",,"nickel and diming, all inclusive, profit strategy"
Do heavier packages pay?,"We just measured a Poland Spring bottle (the new design) and discovered it weighs preciselyhalfof an empty Gatorade bottle.
That’s a lot of shipping, hefting and plastic. Multiply half times a million trillion and that’s huge.
Does it increase sales? My guess is that beverage marketers are too smart to have not considered this, so the answer is probably yes.
Same way the fancy iPod box is a lot sexier than the one they use when you get a free replacement at the Genius bar.
Trivial stuff, certainly. Yet it makes a huge difference. Will it flip soon? Will smaller and lighter begin to equal sexier?
[Update: the facts behind the example are a lot clearer now, thanks to a friend who works in the water business. Before I share his take, though, it’s important to recognize that fashion often follows function… in other words, even though there are functional reasons for the example above, they may very well incite the fashion… He writes:
I thought I would give you a little context around the heavier bottle:
1) First off, …to be the lightest bottle in the marketplace, for two reasons:a) Given the environmental impact of water packaging, it’s the right thing to dob) It makes good business sense to reduce packaging…helps offset rising commodity costs
2) Gatorade (and most other bev manufacturers: Vitamin Water, etc.) HAVE to use the heavier bottle due to the process they use to fill their containers.  It’s called the ""hot-fill"" process (I’ll spare you the details, but you get the point).  This allows them to avoid using artificial ingredients and preservatives.
3) Soda bottles also use heavier bottles due to the integrity needed to avoid exploding bottles (carbonation).  You’ll notice that both Aquafina (Pepsi) and Dasani (Coke) water bottles also use the same heavy bottles…they are purely leveraging existing soda bottles…you will also see that this is quickly changing as they too are lightweighting their bottles.
So that’s it.  Not sure I answered the question of whether heavier packaging increases sales (in our experience, functionality trumps weight)…but I do know that our industry, and CPG companies in general are under tremendous pressure from retailers to lighten their environmental footprints.  While today’s consumers are slow in adopting the same concerns, we believe that ultimately ""greener packaging"" (and products) will begin to make inroads into purchase decisions. ]","December 30, 2007","packaging, marketing, sustainability"

Only two years left,"This is my last post until next week. I want to thank you for reading this year… I'm sure I get more out of this than you do, and I appreciate your attention.
In the meantime, here's a post from four years ago. There's only two years left in the decade, so time's a wasting… Happy new year.
<snip>
Here's a question that you should clip out and tape to your bathroom mirror. It might save you some angst 15 years from now. The question is, What did you do back when interest rates were at their lowest in 50 years, crime was close to zero, great employees were looking for good jobs, computers made product development and marketing easier than ever, and there was almost no competition for good news about great ideas?
Many people will have to answer that question by saying, ""I spent my time waiting, whining, worrying, and wishing."" Because that's what seems to be going around these days. Fortunately, though, not everyone will have to confess to having made such a bad choice.
While your company has been waiting for the economy to rebound, Reebok has launched Travel Trainers, a very cool-looking lightweight sneaker for travelers. They are selling out in Japan — from vending machines in airports!
While Detroit's car companies have been whining about gas prices and bad publicity for SUVs (SUVs are among their most profitable products), Honda has been busy building cars that look like SUVs but get twice the gas mileage. The Honda Pilot was so popular, it had a waiting list.
While Africa's economic plight gets a fair amount of worry, a little startup calledKickstartis actually doing something about it. The new income that its products generate accounts for 0.5% of the entire GDP of Kenya. How? It manufactures a $75 device that looks a lot like a StairMaster. But it's not for exercise. Instead, Kickstart sells the machine to subsistence farmers, who use its stair-stepping feature to irrigate their land. People who buy it can move from subsistence farming to selling the additional produce that their land yields — and triple their annual income in the first year of using the product.
While you've been wishing for the inspiration to start something great, thousands of entrepreneurs have used the prevailing sense of uncertainty to start truly remarkable companies. Lucrative Web businesses, successful tool catalogs, fast-growing PR firms — all have started on a shoestring, and all have been profitable ahead of schedule. The Web is dead, right? Well, try telling that to Meetup.com, a new Web site that helps organize meetings anywhere and on any topic. It has 200,000 registered users — and counting.
Maybe you already have a clipping on your mirror that asks you what you did during the 1990s. What's your biggest regret about that decade? Do you wish that you had started, joined, invested in, or built something? Are you left wishing that you'd at least had the courage to try? In hindsight, the 1990s were the good old days. Yet so many people missed out. Why? Because it's always possible to find a reason to stay put, to skip an opportunity, or to decline an offer. And yet, in retrospect, it's hard to remember why we said no and easy to wish that we had said yes.
The thing is, we still live in a world that's filled with opportunity. In fact, we have more than an opportunity — we have an obligation. An obligation to spend our time doing great things. To find ideas that matter and to share them. To push ourselves and the people around us to demonstrate gratitude, insight, and inspiration. To take risks and to make the world better by being amazing.
Are these crazy times? You bet they are. But so were the days when we were doing duck-and-cover air-raid drills in school, or going through the scares of Three Mile Island and Love Canal. There will always be crazy times.
So stop thinking about how crazy the times are, and start thinking about what the crazy times demand. There has never been a worse time for business as usual. Business as usual is sure to fail, sure to disappoint, sure to numb our dreams. That's why there has never been a better time for the new. Your competitors are too afraid to spend money on new productivity tools. Your bankers have no idea where they can safely invest. Your potential employees are desperately looking for something exciting, something they feel passionate about, something they can genuinely engage in and engage with.
You get to make a choice. You can remake that choice every day, in fact. It's never too late to choose optimism, to choose action, to choose excellence. The best thing is that it only takes a moment — just one second — to decide.
Before you finish this paragraph, you have the power to change everything that's to come. And you can do that by asking yourself (and your colleagues) the one question that every organization and every individual needs to ask today: Why not be great?","December 27, 2007","Opportunity, Action, Excellence"
What’s the point of this interaction?,"Every time you interact with a customer, you’re engaging in marketing. Doesn’t matter if you’re instituting a policy, gaining some data, delivering an invoice… it’s a marketing interaction.
So…
When you bother 100 customers to get useful data from 2, you just paid a marketing cost.
When you yell at a classroom full of kids because one kid misbehaved, that’s a marketing decision.
When you make 5,000 non-smugglers wait in a steaming customs hall at a resort destination, you may think you’re doing your job and collecting those little white forms, but what you’re really doing is marketing (negatively).
And…
When you bring a little candy (which wasn’t required) with the check (which was) you’re using the transaction as an opportunity to do positive marketing.
Here’s a little thought experiment that will show how your managers are misjudging these interactions: Go ask your front line people what they’re doing when they’re doing what they think is their jobs. Like when they’re ripping tickets or answering the phone or filling out a form with a customer. How many say, ""I’m using this as an excuse to market to our best customers""?","December 26, 2007","marketing interaction, customer engagement, positive marketing"
Exclusion,"When I was in college, the Dean tried to put together an advisory group of students. Nobody he invited joined–it wasn’t worth the time. Then he named it, ""The Group of 100"" and in just a few days, it was filled. The easiest way to have insiders is to have outsiders.
Credit card companies have made billions by selling a card that others can’t get.
Politicians stand up and talk about their (exclusive) religion, or pit one special interest group against another.
And of course, the best nightclubs have the biggest velvet ropes and the pickiest doormen.
Limiting the supply of your service, or the quantity of your product, or being aggressive in who you sell to (and who you don’t) are all time-tested ways to build a killer brand. Humans like being insiders, and will work hard to create their own imaginary demarcations to demonstrate that they’ve made it inside.
Populism is almost always a hard sell, it seems.
When Tiffany’s lowered prices and quality and tried to reach out to the masses, they almost went bankrupt.
The Net seems to be turning some of this upside down. Twitter and Yahoo mail and eBay are completely populist. Hotornot, flickr and other websites have embraced this idea as well. (Worth noting that gmail started as a totally insider service, with a limited number of invites, shared person to person).
It’s interesting to take a second to look at wikipedia. It started with the most populist, inclusionary point of view of all, but over time, people being people, a hierarchy and inner circle has been created. The exclusion is based on effort and skill, not race or income, but it’s still exclusionary. And at its best, it makes the site work. When it fails, it limits discussion, reinforces small thinking and enrages the outsiders.
The first thing I’d ask myself before launching a product, a service, or a candidate is, ""who are we leaving out?"" If the answer isno one,be prepared for uncharted waters. The future of marketing (at least the big successes) is going to be fueled by those with the guts to embrace the masses. The profits, at least in the short run, may well be found by those that embrace exclusion.
One last thing: while people are delighted to be included (and seem to enjoy excluding others), the benefits they feel are dwarfed by the anger and disappointment of those excluded. It’s something that people remember for their entire lives.",,"Exclusion, Insiders, Marketing"
What does Santa look like?,"Coke didn’tinventSanta. The astonishing thing is that for a moment we might even believe that they did. If you think about it, our conception of just about every distant historical or mythical figure is just an artifact of the stories that marketers have told us. Sometimes they’re marketing for profit, other times they’re just spinning a tale (Washington and his cherry tree).
It all comes down to two simple things:","December 23, 2007","Santa, marketing, myth"
"Frequency, Frequency, Frequency and the paradox of the Net","The #1 contributor to success in advertising, without any question whatsoever, is frequency. ""Repeat yourself until everyone is annoyed but your accountant,"" says my friend Jay Levinson.
Most of the time, creative entrepreneurs lose interest long before their marketing message loses its power.
The challenge online is this: smart people are bored by frequency. The people you’re trying hardest to reach won’t sit still for repetitive messages. I used to read a certain blog religiously, but after the 300th irrelevant post about his new book, I had to flee. I haven’t been back since.
So this is the dilemma. If the most powerful asset online is permission, the privilege of delivering anticipated, personal and relevant messages to the people who want to get them… and the most powerful tool of advertising is repetition and frequency, which the majority of prospects cringe at (but which works) what to do?
I think there are two strategies that are shaping up online.
The first: burn your permission. Every time you have something to sell, either buy enough ads on popular sites to achieve frequency, or just burn out your core base by repeating your message over and over again. At least you’ll make enough money to be able to rebuild your audience later.
The second: go easy on the frequency and embrace your audience. Give them what they want (interesting, new stuff) instead of what you need (frequency). Play for the long run.

The joy of the commons,"We’re all familiar with the tragedy of the commons. It’s the idea that if everyone shares a resource with no consequences on their individual behavior, people will take but not give and everyone will lose.
Garr Reynolds shows us the joy of the commons. Basically, he’s written a book (thebook) about presentations and PowerPoint and put entirely too much effort into it. It appears that it has taken him tens of thousands of hours, tweaking endless invisible details to bring us this piece of work.
Because the market is crowded, he overdelivered. Dramatically. And it shows.

Your ads are not for you,"Here’s the puzzling math of advertising, offline and on:
In other words, you don’t get 100% attention when you buy an ad. In fact, you don’t get 50% attention or even 1%. If you’re very very good and very lucky, it might be .1% but it’s more likely to be one in 10,000. Which is exactly the right number, it turns out, to make advertising work. Any lower and you couldn’t afford it, any higher and everyone would need a warehouse, not a house, to store all the stuff they bought.
This is no accident, of course. We look at ads when we need to. Then we stop.
The real question is this:who’s likely to look at your ads?Because that’s who you’re advertising to.
This is especially important online, because an unclicked text ad is truly invisible, with very little subliminal value.One surprising viewis that  the typical clicker is female, lower-than-typical income, interested in sweepstakes and coupons. Not that surprising, actually, since if your ‘need’ is for that sort of content, you’re going to click often, and forever. People who click on ads for class action lawyers or kitchen renovation stop doing so once their project is complete. So they’re outnumbered.
Anyway, stop advertising to yourself. You’re already sold. You’re not the target market.","December 20, 2007","advertising, target market, audience"
…and your clicks for free (the new ebook),"For the last two months I’ve been working away on a (short) ebook about traffic. Traffic to your blog or your company site. It has evolved quite a bit, and ended up using Squidoo lenses as a template for the point I was trying to make.
There’s an enormous amount of superstition about what makes some pagesrank high while others languish. When you look at the actual figures,though, much of that fades away.
It turns out that the new playing field enforced by the search engines is eliminating many of the shortcuts that used to be effective. In other words, the best way is the long way.
The long way is to create content that is updated, unique and useful. Again and again we see that sites that do all three manage to get more than their fair share of traffic. So, I guess the title of the ebook is a bit misleading. The clicks don’t cost money, but they do take effort. That’s good news for people who have more talent than cash.

Self promotion,"37 Signals, as usual, has athoughtful post about self promotion.
Except they missed the biggest part, by a mile.
They don’t do self-promotion. Self-promotion, as the term is used by many people, is a mildly pejorative way to describe someone who promotes himself at the expense of others.
Nobody says, ""That Yo Yo Ma, he’s so self-promotional,"" or, ""can you believe what a self-promoter the Dalai Lama is?"" That’s because they’re not promoting themselves. They’re promoting useful ideas. They’re promoting tactics or products thatactually benefit the personthey’re reaching out to.
Paris Hilton is a self-promoter. You don’t get any benefit out of her appearances other than temporary entertainment value and some schadenfreude. The guys at 37 Signals have never done a bit of self-promotion in their entire careers.

eBooks for sale,"While I’ve had some luck selling ebooks, I’ve particularly enjoyed giving them away free. While I was busy doing that, an entire industry has evolved around selling pdfs. The math is simple: sell 10,000 at $30 each and you too can move to Gozo and sit in the sun.
The vernacular of the sales process is fascinating, though. Apparently, many ebook authors believe you need to write pages that are 56 inches long, filled with claims, promises and fake book covers. (and sometimes, as you’ll see below, this works quite well).  I’m not sure that this, by itself, is the future of the medium, though. I think it belongs to people who find a following, curate information for them, build a permission asset and then write a tremendous ebook at a fair price.

Meatballs and permeability,"A few decades ago, Tom Peters argued that outsourcing everything in your company (and letting the various departments compete with outside vendors) made a lot of sense. If you need to run your copy department or factory efficiently enough to compete, you will, the thinking goes.
Logistics turned out to be a big problem with this idea. The fact is, atoms have to travel, so there’s a built-in advantage to the in-house solution.
Bits, on the other hand, don’t care so much about where you are. I needed some typing done on Saturday, so a click to Craigslist and then an email and… it was done. In half the time and for less than half the cost of having someone on staff to do it. At most organizations, especially those with more than fifty employees, there are people standing by to either make things get done quickly (like filing or typing) or to slow them down (like committees, lawyers and approvals, etc.). In each case, those skills aren’t nearly as valuable as they used to be.
When your organization starts freely sharing internal data (like rolodexes and schedules and cost info) and allows easy use of motivated outsiders, things get faster and cheaper and smarter. That’s one of the side effects of organizing around the new marketing as opposed to organizing around the factory.

Building a platform (and thinking about Google’s Knol),"At the end of November, I flew out to give a speech to 350 Google folks. They had invited me to join a panel on the best way to for Google to work with partners.
My riff (I only had about 8 minutes… gotta hate panels) was to point out that AOL, Microsoft, Yahoo and others before them had had the same challenges in building an environment that attracted partners and media companies. (I had run companies that worked with each of them). The question it turns out, is always the same:do you have a platform that I can build a business on?
Obviously, a lot goes into that calculation. It’s not just tools and technology. It’s attitude and predictability. It also involves a threshold, an attainable goal that separates insiders from outsiders.
Take Hollywood, for example. There are literally tens of thousands of people and organizations that have built a business around the movie-making platform. The major studios provide a predictable, profitable place to make a living. Screenwriters, technology companies, advertising agencies–they know that they can depend on the system, and even better, they realize that once they’ve paid some dues, they can profit over time by getting better gigs, more reliable income streams, etc.
Wal-Mart has done the same thing with the businesses and vendors that count on them. They have created a series of rules and procedures and over time, it gets easier and easier to make a living working with them.
Small organizations can do the same thing. Restaurants, for example, build a universe of staff and vendors, each of whom is making a small bet on the stability of the platform as well as the opportunity to exploit economies of scale as a trusted partner.
The challenge for Google, I pointed out (and was echoed by others on the panel) is that the ‘algorithm’ that drives the search engine doesn’t favor trusted partners. The New York Times should get the benefit of the doubt, for example, more than it does. It’s easy to argue for the democratic nature of search results, but both the business environment and human nature demand elements of promotion and trust.
Anyway, I got back from my trip to Google and crunched some numbers and postedthis good newsabout Squidoo. We’ve hit profitability, grown to be three to five times as big as others in our space and reached more than 125,000 users. A good day.
The very next day, GoogleannouncedKnol, a direct lift from Squidoo circa 2005. Apparently, Google wants to be in our business. It’s almost enough to ruin your day.
Then, a funny thing happened: I started getting notes of congratulations. Of all the business models and all the internet ideas to jump on, Google had chosen ours. There were hundreds of neat ideas out there, but they picked ours.
That goes a long way to legitimize the original idea. It brings new users into the space. It makes it easier to findpartnerswho want to exploit this ‘new’ idea. It allows room forcreativity.It’s not about whether or not someone should be doing this. It’s about which place they want to do it in. That’s a huge change.
Just as the acquisition of blogger led to an explosion in blogging software, Google’s Knol makes the space pioneered by Squidoo a lot more attractive.  Apparently, the best thing that can happen to you if you pick Google as a platform is thatthey mimic you.This isn’t true in the restaurant business (it’s bad news for the farmers when a restaurant starts its own farm). This isn’t true for Hollywood (it’s bad news when the movie studios start their own film processing labs.) The nature of the Web, though, seems to be that because of the very openness of the system, imitation is the highest form of endorsement.
[aside: I couldn’t resist responding to Udi Manber’s posting about why Google is launching Knol. He said, ""We believe that many do not share that knowledge today simply because it is not easy enough to do that."" Well, I took the sample page (under Creative Commons) that his wife had written andturned it into a Squidoo lens. I even added a few features that would double the income she might earn for the charity of her choice. It didn’t take very long.]","December 16, 2007","Google, Knol, platform"

Facebook’s generational challenge,"Last month, I posted about Facebook’sissue with ads. I just had two fascinating interactions with the site that point to the good news and the bad news about their future.
I’ll confess I’m not a Facebook user. I have an account as a way of checking it out, but I’ve ‘friended’ very few people. Why? Because if I friend you, especially someone I don’t know, I’m giving you explicit permission to start a fairly intense series of interactions. This makes good commercial sense if you’re an insurance salesman or even a musician looking for gigs, but if you’ve got a limit on the time you can invest, it’s not only time-consuming, it’s a recipe to bitterly disappoint people. I’m amazed at people who claim to have a thousand friends on FB. Friendship is a little like the Navy. Either you’re in or you’re out.
What I’ve recently discovered is that even myrealfriends, the handful I’ve got on my list, aren’t so good at answering messages (at least messages from me). Three out of the last four people I pinged, folks that would always answer a phone call or an email, haven’t written back. That’s probably because my generation hasn’t figured out how to filter, prioritize and work with the incoming the way we have with email.  This test group appears to have fallen into the trap of accepting friend requests because they didn’t want to offend people and now they’re overwhelmed with noise, all of it at precisely the same level of urgency. There’s no doubt that technology will come up with a far better solution–networked friend-based messaging ought to be super smart and efficient.
The flipside? A friend got into college last week. The university gave her a list of the kids from our state who also got in. Within 24 hours, they were all friends. ALL of them! They knew who knew who, what they looked like, what their histories were. Facebook to the rescue. A new network built on the old network within minutes.

This is the new politics,"Forget about YouTube debates.
The future of politics looks just likewhat Cory did to the Canadian DMCAthe last few weeks.
One person, with just a few hard-working people in the field, managed to derail a bill that lobbyists spent millions of dollars on.
Sure, it helps that it was a lousy bill, that Cory co-writes the most popular blog in the world and that the bill was about something that blog readers care about. Doesn’t matter. Because as readership grows and issues start attracting loyal readers, what this proves is that Tip O’Neill was wrong. All politics isn’t local. All politics is about permission. The permission to share your views with people who want to hear them, people who take action, people who tell their friends.

The Billion-Dollar T-Shirt,"This is my favorite article of clothing, and for good reason. It’s a t-shirt I produced in 1994 (14 years ago) to promote abookI worked on for almost a year. The book was more than 500 pages long. The t-shirt cost me at least a billion dollars.
In 1993, I knew a fair amount about the internet, more, I daresay, than most people. I had built products for Prodigy, was working with AOL and had even used a prototype version of Mosaic. I saw what was coming.
So, my company decided to writeThe Best of the Net. Instead of building a search engine or an auction site or a payment system or … we decided to spend a year writing a book.
Why?
Agenda.Every morning in those days, I woke up and asked myself a question: What should I write a book about?
Assets.I had all the tools I needed to write and sell books. I had a great team, access to the publishing community, a brand… I figured my job was to leverage those assets.
Assumptions.I assumed that the world would stay pretty much the same while I leveraged my assets and completed my agenda.
So I ended up with a t-shirt.

Getting sad at Whole Foods (more vs. less),"A trip to the Whole Foods Market used to be really fun. It’s an amusement park for food, a place where the lights are bright, the vegetables are fresh, the potato chips apparently guilt free.
Sometime in the last year, it feels to me, the story changed.
The mantra of ""less"" which is a natural offshoot of carbon-footprint thinking, combined with the mantra of ""less"" which is a natural offshoot of overfishing, combined with… have made shopping in a store like this a contest over who can have less impact.
So, here’s a can of tuna, but maybe that’s not okay because it’s a can and it’s tuna.
And here’s an avocado, but maybe that’s not okay because it came a long way in a truck.
And on and on.
For me, local and organic is a treat. I feel great doing it and I’m happy to invest the time to go to the Union Square market. I wonder, though, about how long the legs on that story are. If we’re going to make people feel guilty when they spend money, pretty soon they’re going to start ignoring the story that makes them feel guilty.

People don’t truly care about privacy,"There’s been a lot of noise about privacy over the last decade, but what most pundits miss is that most people don’t care about privacy, not at all.
If they did, they wouldn’t have credit cards. Your credit card company knows an insane amount about you.
What people care about is being surprised.
If your credit card company called you up and said, ""we’ve been looking over your records and we see that you’ve been having an extramarital affair. We’d like to offer you a free coupon for VD testing…"" you’d freak out, and for good reason.
If the local authorities start using what’s on the corner surveillance cameras to sell you a new kind of commuter token, you’d be a little annoyed at that as well.
So far, government and big companies have gotten away with taking virtually all our privacy away by not surprising most of us, at least not in a vivid way. Libertarians are worried (probably with cause) that once the surprises start happening, it’ll be too late.

This leads us to Ask.com’s new Eraser service, which promises to not remember stuff about your searching. The problem they face: most peoplewantGoogle and Yahoo and Amazon to remember their searches, because it leads to better results and (so far) rarely leads to surprises.
The irony is that the people who most want privacy are almost certainly the worst possible customers for a search engine. These are the folks who are unlikely to click on ads and most likely to visit the dark corners of the Net. If I were running a  web property, I’d work hard to attract the people wholeastwant privacy and want to share their ideas with everyone else

Meatball Mondae: Millions of channels on AdWords,"Google AdWords is a very simple idea that’s surprisingly little understood. On every page of Google search results, in your Gmail and your Froogle results, and more and more on the pages of other Web sites (like Squidoo or the New York Times), you’ll find these ads.
The AdWords are smart. They appear based on the context of what you’re doing. Search for “Bextra” in Google and you’ll find plenty of articles about this discontinued pain reliever. But look over at the ads and you’ll see that many of them belong to law firms. These firms are paying handsomely for your attention. They are filing class action lawsuits on behalf of people injured by Bextra, and the law firms figure that the very best way to reach those people is to find them at exactly the same moment that those people are looking for them. In other words, instead of racing around trying to generate attention, the firms merely stand by and wait for attention to find them.
Not since the Yellow Pages has there been a ubiquitous directory that brings together the searchers and the sought.
Not only do AdWords show up at the right time, but they are also priced intelligently. The Yellow Pages charged based on the size of the ad, and you paid whether the ads worked or not.
For AdWords, on the other hand, Google charges by the click. This means that the advertiser determines what it’s worth to get a visit from an interested, qualified, and motivated consumer and pays exactly that. If someone else is willing to pay more, they get the traffic instead.
The bidding system means that the advertisers with the most motivation pay the most for top billing. At the same time, Google will adjust placement based on how many times an ad is clicked on. As a result, the ads that run the most are focused, relevant, and beneficial to both sides.
While this is clearly good news for Google (millions of businesses and organizations bidding against each other, with all the money going to Google!), it’s also great news for marketers. Even marketers who don’t think of themselves as marketers.
The Kahn Law Firm probably thought of themselves as litigators, not marketers. But by using AdWords to assemble a large class of people who saw themselves as victims of a poorly labeled medication, Kahn has an advantage over other law firms. Kahn wins this round not by using their litigation skills, but by understanding the New Marketing.
Every day, hundreds of millions of people do hundreds of millions of searches on Google. Each search is its own “channel.” Each search represents a distinct marketing vehicle, a chance for an individual to directly connect with a marketer.
So the question is this: If there were a TV channel all about exactly what you sell, and the ads cost about $1 each, would you buy them?

Thinking about Canadian pricing,"For a long time, Canada was a hassle. I still remember years ago, going to ""Canadian pricing meetings"" where we could discuss how to price our software for the Canadian market.
Canada is a fantastic country, almost certainly more attractive (in terms of a place to live or people to hang out with) than any other I know of. But for US manufacturers, it’s a foreign country, with customs and distributors and yes, currency exchange. For decades, the US dollar was worth more than the Canadian, so the easy thing to do was to jack up your prices. Now you had extra cash flow to make up for the difficulties.
Of course, the loonie is now worth more than a buck, so from a marketing point of view, Canada is a huge issue. When you have $28 written on your product but try to sell it for $35 in Canada, you’re doing nothing but annoying your northern neighbors. When you prohibit your Detroit car dealers from selling cars to visiting Canadians, you’re enraging them.
When I was growing up in Buffalo, businesses had three choices when dealing with visitors from Canada (just ten miles away): they could take Canadian currency but charge a fee for the transaction, they could refuse to take Canadian currency, or they could take it at par even though it was worth less.
Guess which companies got the business.
I think you have the same choice today with the products you export. If you expect to get your fair share of the market up North, you better have parity in your pricing, even if it costs you more to get the product there.",,"Canadian pricing, currency exchange, market strategy"
Marksmanship,"In a new study released in today’sTimes,it turns out that the typical NY police officer only hits 34% of the time she fires a gun. Even from a distance of six feet or less, it’s 43%. Obviously, Bruce Willis is the exception.
I wonder how it changes your decision making when you discover that you’re only going to be successful one out of three times. Never mind blasting a weapon out of an assailant’s hand, we’re talking about hitting the target at all… How does a cop have the guts to even pull a weapon knowing that most of the time, it’s not going to have its desired effect (my guess is that the threat and the noise and chaos is as positive an outcome as an actual hit…). I know I would never have the guts to do that job.
Salespeople have a harder time with this than marketers. Marketers have lots of ‘bullets’ and they don’t notice the ones they miss (I usually miss 99.5% of the time online, and more than 99.999% of the time selling books). We just reload and blithely continue on. But salespeople have to deal both with personal rejection and the expectation of the boss.
The poor hit rate of selling explains call resistance. Non-professional salespeople almost aways wash out because they can’t keep at it, day after day, once they realize that most of the time, they fail. I guess my point is that if a policeman can risk his life doing it, we can probably find the nerve to go on one more sales call.","December 9, 2007","Marksmanship, Sales Resistance, Coping with Failure"

"Monopolies, seven years later","Seven years ago, I wrote an article about media, copyright, monopolies and the future. You can find the unedited versionright here. I’m fascinated by the stuff I got right, and amused that while the concepts are there, many of the examples would be different today.
Here’s a (slightly) shorter version, because most people don’t read long stuff so much:
You’re a monopolist.
Not that there’s anything wrong with that, of course.
If you’re reading this magazine, it’s likely that you’re asuccessful member of the profit-seeking entertainment industry. And ifyou’re making money in movies, books, music or TV, it’s because you cantake advantage of a legacy of monopolistic (or maybe oligopolistic)practices.
Having a monopoly is fun and exciting and fraught with power. It’s also intoxicating.
How else to explain the hubris of three of Hollywood’s best andbrightest launching a well-funded website that managed to go out ofbusiness before it even launched? If you’re used to being able tocorner the market, it’s easy to think that another medium is justanother medium.
How else to explain the exploits of the RIAA as they valiantly duelwith Napster, trying to put the genie of widespread music distributionback into the bottle. They’re used to having a monopoly on thedistribution of music, and they want it back.
How else to explain the antics of the book industry as they stumbletheir way through the minefields of Microsoft, Stephen King and freee-books? ""Publishers control the distribution, not these weenies,dammit!""
It was great to be a monopolist. Steady profits and no hassles. Itwould be great if we could stay monopolists forever, wouldn’t it?
Before you call the Justice Department, let me explain. The limitedsupply of content, the few choices of distribution–these practices areall legal… most of them are actually enforced by the government. Butunderstanding where these monopolies came from (and why they’re goingaway-fast(!)) will give you a new way of looking at your business, andit turns out that this sort of analysis can open amazing new marketsand new ways of generating profits.
We know that if you offer a smart consumer two products that areabsolutely identical (same quality, similar brand attributes, just asconvenient), she’ll choose the cheaper one. Gasoline stations haveprice wars-but movie theatres don’t. Supermarkets lose money when theysell milk, but TV networks are dedicated to turning a profit on justabout everything. The heart of the mediabusinessis the prospect of being a monopolist-of getting paid alotmore than our products cost to make. But when the monopoly goes away,there’s not a lot of room for obscene profits. In markets where peoplehave a choice between equals, the cheapest and most convenient oftenwin.
Over time, the media business has done everything it can to be sure that consumersdon’thave a choice. After all, a CD increases in price about 25 times fromthe time it’s made to the time it’s purchased by the listener. And a TVad that costs a network zero to broadcast might end up selling for amillion dollars.
There are three things that led to the monopolies we now enjoy:
This triad is responsible for the profits you’re enjoying right now.Imagine a nightmare of a world in which all three legs on this stooldisappear. At the same time.
Time to wake up. It just happened.
THE MONOPOLIES ARE DYING…AND THEY’RE GETTING DEADER
The past, the glorious, profit-making,funpast of the media business was based on:• scarce creators, under long term contracts• scarce retail outlets, able to be controlled with marketing muscle• scarce spectrum (few radio stations, few TV stations)• copyright laws (and a lack of technology) that limited theft of services• limited power of the creators to compete without a large media company as partner
It’s hard to outline a point of view that shows the power of any form of media gettingstrongerover the next decade. There are going to be more TV channels, not less.More ways for authors to distribute their works, not less. More waysfor musicians to connect with listeners, not less. More ways forconsumers to sample or take content, not less.
You were a monopolist. You’re not anymore.
To succeed in the old days, here’s what you needed to do (choose any two!):1. Grab a piece of the electromagnetic spectrum, hopefully one limited by the government2. Buy up the supply of actors or writers3. Establish long term profitable relationships with distributors and retail outlets
Welcome to a new century. In the new century, we all have the same goal:1. Establish a direct and positive relationship with the end user.
It sounds easy. It’s not. It’s scary. It’s likely to wreck yourbusiness before it saves it. Doesn’t matter. The truth is: businessesthat don’t aggressively pursue this tactic will disappear.

Are all three of these examples perfect businesses, bound tobankrupt you and your peers? No way. They’re nits. Chinks in the armor.Little businesses that might get bigger. Sure, there are tons ofexample of well-financed new media companies that went under. That’snot the point. The point is that individuals with little or no moneyare building real media properties that are attracting the consumersthatyouwant to attract. There will be plenty of carnage and disappointments in this new arena. Who cares? What matters is that thereisa new arena. It’s mere presence means that the monopolies are dying.
I had coffee with the executive producer of a network news show lastweek. He told me that every year, in addition to getting smaller insize, his audience, on average, ages almost a year. The people he needsin order to maintain his monopoly are finding something else to do withtheir time.
Need more proof? Take a look at Tivo and Replay. These digital VCRshave tiny audiences (but expect a bunch to sell this Christmas). It’seasy to dismiss them as toys for the digerati. Easy, except for onefact: 80% of the people who use one of these devices skipallof the commercials during the shows they watch. ALL of them!

But when movies are shown on DVD players in my house andyours, there’s room for hundreds of millions of movies to open on thesame day!
Think it’s easy to sell banners on the Internet? There are 40million different sites, with more every day. How much of a premium areyou, the advertiser, willing to pay for one thousand impressions onthissite instead ofthatsite? That’s why the CPM went from $100 a thousand to a buck in lessthan two years. What happens to the ad sales of your TV network whenthere are 40 million different TV networks? What happens to the budgetfor your new arthouse movie when there are millions of people crankingout their own arthouse movies?
You’re not going out of business tomorrow. The structures you’vebuilt and perfected are going to stick around for a long time. We stillwant blockbuster movies and the Top 40 and Tom Clancy’s next book. Butit’s not going to get better, more profitable or more fun. It’s goingto get worse.
As I write this, NBC has flown hundreds of its best people toSydney. Is it possible to overpay for the Olympics? When the massmarket is long gone, and network viewership is at an all time low,probably not. It’s a fun way to revisit the glory days of Ed Sullivanand Mary Tyler Moore. Alas, in the long run, the folks who run theOlympics will end up with all the money and NBC (or whatever network isdumb enough to take its place) ends up with two weeks of memories and ablack hole where their wallet used to be. People are wringing theirhands over NBC’s Olympic ratings. They say they’re lousy because of thetime zone issue. Nonsense. They’re lousy because Americans are nolonger willing to sit down for two weeks and all watch the same stuff,especially when it’s jammed with irrelevant commercials.
The alert reader now interrupts and shouts, ""Wait a minute!"" Afterall, Pop.com just went bust. Viacom spent a ton on MTVi, and look whereit got them. And Warner Bros. spent years and years with anentertainment portal (lately called Entertaindom) and it tanked as well.
""We’re not against new media. We just think it’s a bit of a fraud.""
And my response is to cry foul. I spent years dealing with many ofthese organizations, and I was astonished and overwhelmed by thecombination of old-media thinking, arrogance and lack of vision theymanaged to squeeze into just a few very well furnished audiences.
…
…Don’t bring the old monopoly-driven mindsets to the non-monopolymarketplaces! Just because you can get away with being a bully (""Do youknowwhoyou’re talking to!"") in your current job doesn’t meanthat the mindset is going to fly in a world where the rules aredifferent.

So now, the good news:
Oprah Winfrey launched a magazine in the Spring. It has millions of readers, starting from zero. Probably profitable from day 1.
Stephen King wrote a book and more than 150,000 gladly paid him for a chance to read the first chapter.
Jimmy Buffet is one of the most successfully recording artists working today, and he rarely makes a record.
The answer to your monopoly problem is to create a new monopoly. I call it the Permission Monopoly.
Here’s how it works:
Everyone has a limited attention span. We can’t read all the bookswe want, listen to all the music we want, go to all the movies. So wefilter. We ignore. We procrastinate. And we hide.
Have you heard the new album from Bill Frisell? ReadDescarte’s Error?Seen Croupier? Didn’t think so. No time. Of course, if someone youtrusted insisted that you spend the time to try them out, you might. Ofcourse, if they were created by people you’d liked in the past, you’dbe more likely to try them out. If you could try them out for free,you’d be more likely to try them out as well.
In the past, Tower Records or The Tattered Cover or WNEW or GeneralCinema was appointed (by default) as the arbiter of what we’d payattention to. If it got played on the radio, we heard it. If it was bythe cash register, we saw it. If Brandon Tartikoff liked it, we watchedit.
In today’s million channel universe, though, those arbiters are alot less powerful. Now, maybe I want Slate to recommend it. Now, maybethe programmer of my internet radio station has to cue it up.
So, without powerful arbiters, it’s way harder for powerful mediacompanies to modify the marketing conversation. Way harder for tenwell-funded salespeople to get shelf space everywhere that matters. Wayharder for a crack PR person to get you a review in just the rightpublication.
What’s a megalomaniac media mogul to do?
The wrong strategy, it seems to me, is to go court and try to stopthe leaky bucket. It also seems like a mistake to call the authors andfilmmakers and others who abandon you, ""crazy"" or ""short-term focused""or to say, ""well, they can get away with that but the others can’t.""
The defectors know something you don’t. The defectors know that ifthey hurry, they can build a new monopoly, a monopoly you don’tcontrol. They know that they can build a direct and long-termrelationship with the end user, one that will survive competitiveincursions and will last a long time.ifthey hurry.
And so, learn from these folks.youshould hurry. Youmusthurry. If you understand that the game is radically and permanentlybeing changed, you can go out today and start building mutuallybeneficial relationships with your listeners/readers/watchers. You canoffer these folks something of value in exchange for their attention.You can then build a new monopoly.
Imagine trying to get Bill Clinton to allow you to publish his newautobiography. What happens when you can say, ""We have apermission-based relationship with 32 million Americans, all of whomlook forward to hearing from us every two weeks with our hot new bookofferings. And by the way, our competition doesn’t even have 10 names.""
What happens when you’re trying to break a great new trance band,and you have permission to send the first single, by e-mail, to 600,000kids who loved the last trance band you broke? Think that helps yourcareer?
PLEASE NOTE: I’mnottalking about treating consumers the way you andother marketers have been treating them for a century. No churn andburn. No contemptuous, ""we’ll talk to you when we want to, otherwisekeep quiet!"" And no renting, buying or selling lists. No, I’m talkingabout treating this new client the same way you treat your mostimportant retail account or radio station or theater owner. You don’tshow up at his house in the middle of the night (or if you do, youbring a big box of cubans). You don’t send them e-mail spam, or callthem on the phone over and over again.
You have a relationship. You understand that every interaction hasto benefit BOTH of you or the relationship is over. If you’re going tobuild a monopoly on consumer attention, you’ll need to do the samething.
Here’s how I boil it down to as few words as possible:1. Make it easy for your happy users to tell as many of their friends as possible.2. Give away free samples early and often.3. Get permission from anyone who likes what you do to follow up withanticipated, personal and relevant messages that benefit both of you.4. If this requires changing what you make and what you charge for, fine.5. If steps 1,2, 3 and 4 mess up your current business model, fine.
…
The new monopoly of the future ispermission. Permission to talk toyour customers directly about new stuff. Permission to teach,permission to ask, permission to learn. If you have that monopoly, youprofit over and over and over again.
…
The power is certainly moving. It’s moving from five oligopolisticstatus quo gatekeepers that controlled money and promotion and retailto a much messier, faster-moving, more interesting amalgamation ofdatabase keepers, musicians and fans.

The discipline of one ring,"There were 12 people on line at the post office today. That’s fine, I guess, because for most shipments, the post office is both a monopoly and a pretty good value. So service isn’t high on their list.
There are many businesses, though, that have no other useful tool available to build market share. They can’t profitably advertise (at least not so much any more) and they have competition. So they say they’re in the ""service business.""
But then, here comes the dreaded, ""due to unusually heavy call volume…"" or the line at the door or the interminable wait for a waiter.
[To interject: I’m not arguing that every business practice needs to be instant, or totally cater to the needs of the user. For example, I don’t think Google ought to have operators standing by to answer toll free calls from people who don’t know how to use the search engine. I’m arguing that if you’re going to compete on service, you ought to compete on service. Back to the post…]
So, some companies have decided to answer the phone onone ring. Fedex did this for a long, long time. Rackspace still does, which is exactly why we chose them (and they’ve made enough from one account with us to pay for dozens of people to answer the phone…).
When you need to answer the phone in one ring, you discover exactly what it means to provide a certain level of service. Either you’re succeeding or failing. So you hire more people and devote more resources, because there is no slippery slope. On or off.

Big Ideas (Meatball Mondae 11),"In a factory-based organization, little ideas are the key to success. Small improvements in efficiency or design can improve productivity and make a product just a bit more appealing. New Marketing, which exists in the noisy marketplace, demands something bigger. It demands ideas that force people to sit up and take notice.
At the same time that we see how game-changing ideas (like the iPhone) can trump little improvements, we’re also noting the end of the “big idea” in advertising.
There’s a difference between a big idea that comes from a product or service and a big idea that comes from the world of advertising.
The secret of big-time advertising during the 1960s and ’70s was the “big idea.” InA Big Life in Advertising, ad legend Mary Wells Lawrence writes, “… our goal was to have big, breakthrough ideas, not just to do good advertising. I wanted to create miracles.” A big idea could build a brand, a career, or an entire agency.
Charlie the Tuna was a big idea. So was “Plop, plop, fizz, fizz.”
Big ideas in advertising worked great when advertising was in charge. With a limited amount of spectrum and a lot of hungry consumers, the stage was set to put on a show. And the better the show, the bigger the punchline, the more profit could be made.
Today, the advertiser’s big idea doesn’t travel very well. Instead, the idea must be embedded into the experience of the product itself. Once again, what we used to think of as advertising or marketing is pushed deeper into the organization. Let the brilliant ad guys hang out with your R&D team and watch what happens.
Yes, there are big ideas. They’re just not advertising-based.

"Thanks for calling, please go away","Most customer service organizations are architected around a simple idea: interacting with customers is expensive, driving costs down is a good thing, thus getting people to go away is beneficial.
Think about it: most inbound customer service people are rewarded for on-phone efficiency. Calls per hour. Lack of escalations. Limited complaints. What’s the best way to do that? Get people to go away.
If you’re on this system and a long-time customer calls in with a complicated problem, one that’s going to require supervisor intervention and follow up, what’s your best plan? Is it to spend an hour with this person over three days, or is the system designed to have you politely get them to just give up?
I’d focus on building a system that measures [sales rate before call] vs. [sales rate after call]. If the sales rate goes up, give the call center person a raise. It’s that simple.
Paypal seized the money in my account on Friday. After seven years as a user, they decided my new DVD project was suspiciously successful and it triggered all sorts of alarms. The first step was a call from them… a cheerful person asked me a few questions and all seemed fine. Then, with no warning, they escalated the process. The system they put me in treated me like a criminal and at every step they made it difficult for me to keep going. Phone calls were made, and I spoke with two incredibly friendly people who were clearly unable to do anything other than be friendly. Both people were happy to talk to me for as long as I wanted, but neither person was able to do anything at all. The system is clearly designed this way… to insulate the people who make decisions from the actual customers. The desired outcome (I go away) doesn’t seem like it’s aligned with the corporate goals (I stick around).
The question I’d be asking is, ""Do people who go through process and manage to prove that they are not criminals end up doing more business with us as a result of the way we treated them?"" If the answer is no, you’re probably doing it wrong.
The last straw was this: After I put together all the documents they wanted (including a copy of my passport) and created a PDF, I tried to upload it. They don’t take PDFs, the alert box said, just JPGs. So I sent the images and get this notice:
I followed up with the email address on the screen and got an email back, informing me that the email I had mailed to at PayPal wasn’t monitored.
Sigh.
[PS in the ninety minutes after I posted this, I heard from a slew of people. Guess what? Every single one had a Paypal horror story to share. Once you teach an entire organization to mistreat customers, it’s hard to fix.]

Permission Marketing,"Permission marketing is the privilege (not the right) of delivering anticipated, personal and relevant messages to people who actually want to get them.
It recognizes the new power of the best consumers to ignore marketing. It realizes that treating people with respect is the best way to earn their attention.
Pay attention is a key phrase here, because permission marketers understand that when someone chooses to pay attention they are actually paying you with something precious. And there’s no way they can get their attention back if they change their mind. Attention becomes an important asset, something to be valued, not wasted.
Real permission is different from presumed or legalistic permission. Just because you somehow get my email address doesn’t mean you have permission. Just because I don’t complain doesn’t mean you have permission. Just because it’s in the fine print of your privacy policy doesn’t mean it’s permission either.
Real permission works like this: if you stop showing up, people complain, they ask where you went.
I got a note from a Daily Candy reader the other day. He was upset because for three days in a row, his Daily Candy newsletter hadn’t come. That’s permission.
Permission is like dating. You don’t start by asking for the sale at first impression. You earn the right, over time, bit by bit.
One of the key drivers of permission marketing, in addition to the scarcity of attention, is the extraordinarily low cost of dripping to people who want to hear from you. RSS and email and other techniques mean you don’t have to worry about stamps or network ad buys every time you have something to say. Home delivery is the milkman’s revenge… it’s the essence of permission.
Permission doesn’t have to be formal but it has to be obvious. My friend has permission to call me if he needs to borrow five dollars, but the person you meet at a trade show has no such ability to pitch you his entire resume, even though he paid to get in.
Subscriptions are an overt act of permission. That’s why home delivery newspaper readers are so valuable, and why magazine subscribers are worth more than newsstand ones.
In order to get permission, you make a promise. You say, “I will do x, y and z, I hope you will give me permission by listening.” And then, this is the hard part, that’s all you do. You don’t assume you can do more. You don’t sell the list or rent the list or demand more attention. You can promise a newsletter and talk to me for years, you can promise a daily RSS feed and talk to me every three minutes, you can promise a sales pitch every day (the wayWootdoes). But the promise is the promise until both sides agree to change it. You don’t assume that just because you’re running for President or coming to the end of the quarter or launching a new product that you have the right to break the deal. You don’t.
Permission doesn’t have to be a one-way broadcast medium. The internet means you can treat different people differently, and it demands that you figure out how to let your permission base choose what they hear and in what format.
When I launched mybookthat coined this phrase 9 years ago, I offered people a third of the book for free in exchange for an email address. And I never, ever did anything with those addresses again. That wasn’t part of the deal. No follow ups, no new products. A deal’s a deal.
If it sounds like you need humility and patience to do permission marketing, you’re right. That’s why so few companies do it properly. The best shortcut, in this case, is no shortcut at all.",,"Permission marketing, attention, consumer respect"
Linkbait,"Insiders know what it is, but it’s a new term to many.
Here’s what you do:Put a picture on your website. Something novel but still recognizable.Or something really useful.Then, put lots of links to various websites within the image.Or, if you want, make it something remarkably honest or confessional or provocative.Or make it a top 10 or top 41 list.Then, tell the people you’re linking to about it.

Tribe Management,"Brand management is so 1999.
Brand management was top down, internally focused, political and money based. It involved an MBA managing the brand, the ads, the shelf space, etc. The MBA argued with product development and manufacturing to get decent stuff, and with the CFO to get more cash to spend on ads.
Tribe management is a whole different way of looking at the world.
It starts with permission, the understanding that the real asset most organizations can build isn’t an amorphous brand but is in fact the privilege of delivering anticipated, personal and relevant messages to people who want to get them.
It adds to that the fact that what people really want is the ability to connect to each other, not to companies. So the permission is used to build a tribe, to build people who want to hear from the company because it helps them connect, it helps them find each other, it gives them a story to tell and something to talk about.
And of course, since this is so important, product development and manufacturing and the CFOworkfor the tribal manager. Everything the organization does is to feed and grow and satisfy the tribe.
Instead of looking for customers for your products, you seek out products (and services) for the tribe. Jerry Garcia understood this. Do you?
Who does this work for? Try record companies and bloggers, real estate agents and recruiters, book publishers and insurance companies. It works for Andrew Weil and for Rickie Lee Jones and for Rupert at the WSJ… But it also works for a small web development firm or a venture capitalist.
People form tribes with or without us. The challenge is to work for the tribe and make it something even better.","January 30, 2008","Tribe Management, Brand Management, Community Building"
The Hyping Point,"A few readers have written in, asking me about a recent article in Fast Company about Malcolm Gladwell’s  Tipping Point and new research by Duncan Watts. (Cory’s take on it ishere). Full disclosure: Duncan is brilliant, and so is Malcolm. Which is my point, I guess. Duncan’s work does nothing at all to discredit the importance of what Gladwell is saying in theTipping Point. Mostly, I think it’s a provocative headline designed to get clicks for the magazine…
As I understand it, people are influenced by the people around them. That we act, like buffalo, in a herd. The idea that a single influential individual (even a blogger likeGuyor a talk show host like Oprah) can individually change the herd is crazy, and I don’t think anyone has argued that.
What should be really clear, though, is that people with big audiences certainly count as one of the people around you. If the guy down the row at work buys a Mac Air, it counts. If Guy buys a Mac Air, it counts just as much (or possibly a bit more). If a kid in school is listening to Ini, it counts. And if you hear HotStepper on a popular radio station, it counts just as much. Since people with big audiences have more ‘friends’ and have more ‘people down the hall’, they have more influence. Not because they count for more, just because they ‘know’ more people. (Forgive the excessive use of single quotation marks, please).
Unleashing the Ideavirusdidn’t spread because ‘important’ people endorsed and promoted it. It spread because passionate people did.
One more reason not to obsess about the A list in any media category. Worry instead about people with passion and people with lots of friends. You need both for ideas to spread. That was Malcolm’s point all along.","January 29, 2008","Influence, Ideas, Social Networks"
After the lawyers,"If it’s in print, it matters even more. Things in print have a tone and a finality that add an impact that you need to care about.
So, after the lawyers are done, let the marketers make sure it sounds like you. Your signs, your contacts, your fine print… your words don’t just sit there, they shout.
Consider this sign (hidden camera quality, sorry). Here are the highlights:THERE ARE NO REFUNDS, NO EXCEPTIONS.THERE ARE NO EXCHANGES ON PLANTS.ALL LISTED CONDITIONS MUST BE MET IN ORDER TO RECEIVE EQUAL OR LESSER VALUE EXCHANGE.

Needle in a Haystack marketing,"So, why bother everyone with a blog post about iPhone voice mail?
It used to be that marketing to the masses cost a fortune, or sometimes, two fortunes.
With a blog or CraigsList or Squidoo, you can enter your information into the vast online database for free.
No, doing that won’t reach everyone. In fact, it will reach almost no one.
But that’s fine if the few people you do reach are the people who are looking for you. My iPhone post will get seen by the hundred or thousand people who do the precise Google search that turns it up. And they’ll be glad they did.
If you’re using a tool that supports this sort of deep search (this blog is a poor example of that, of course) and you’ve got the time, go ahead and solve very specific problems, realizing that you won’t reach everyone, just the people who care a great deal.
The two tips I have for you:
1. Be sure to really and truly solve the searcher’s problem. Boilerplate and selfish redirection of attention are bogus strategies that don’t pay off. I likethissolution to thesearchfor ""Michelle Obama pictures,"" and it’s no surprise it comes up first.

The last interaction,"Marketers (and high school kids) focus a lot on the first date. After all, you never get a second chance to make a first impression.
I recently had some waterproofing done in the basement. The first date was great. The company was professional and had every single element down, from their AdWords to the web site to the way they interacted on the phone and in person.
I think that stuff is pretty important, but I’m way more interested in the last interaction than I am in the first (and if you care about word of mouth, you should be too).
After they finished the job, they left my basement a mess.
Forever, my only memory of the job is going to be the mess. Forever, the only thing I’ll talk about is the mess. The last interaction, in my experience, is responsible for virtually all of the word of mouth you’re going to get, positive or negative.
That free muffin at the restaurant or the lollipop at the barber or the call from the Realtor a week after the house is sold and contracts are signed and the movers have left… believe it or not, it matters.

Or the angry customer who is bitter, vindictive, loud and out to cost you your job… even though they must know it’s not your fault. Or perhaps it’s the employee who refuses to exert a little extra energy even though it would help all of you.
It’s enough to make you scream. Or give up.
Here’s a thought: Maybe it’s not bad judgment.
Try this on: ""If I believed what you believe, I’d probably be acting exactly the same way you are right now."" (Better thought than said, probably).
You know what, that’s almost certainly true… if I believed what you said when you wrote that angry blog post, I probably would have written the same thing.
Once we realize that it’s not a matter of judgment, but a matter of belief, everything changes.

Someone asked me which post on this blog represented the turning point of its growth. The ‘breakthrough’ post. It turns out that there wasn’t one. Instead, there were 2,500 posts, one after the other, each building (and I was learning from each) as we went.
Wikipedia is built on a bold idea: launch with a few hundred mediocre articles. Challenge people to add a few more. And then, day after day, layer on top of that, improving each one, improving a hundred thousand of them, improving a million of them. One after another, layer after layer.
Squidoo is a bit different. Let each person layer their own page, instead of a crowd. And then, as time goes by and the crowd gets bigger, the new folks are smarter (and building better pages) because they’ve watched the results that others have layered up.
Organizations that make the same mistakes every day (hidebound ones, rulebook based ones, airlines) rarely get to layer. They don’t grow and improve, because they’re not organized to do so.
And thus the challenge. We live in a layered world now. Those that plan and plan and then launch are always going to be at a disadvantage to the layerers.",,"Layering, Growth, Improvement"

How much for digital?,"The movie studios are starting to get excited about renting movies digitally (viaAppleand others). The pricing seems to be modeled on Blockbuster (+). Figure $3 a rental, another buck or so for HD. That seems ‘fair’, because it’s in the same range as we’re used to.
But wait.
Blockbuster buys DVDs for $15 or $20 (probably a lot less in volume, but I have no clue what the real number is). The studios have to pay for duplication and warehousing and marketing and they take a risk with every pressing that they’ll have toshred the leftovers.
Blockbuster then rents them out 30 or 40 or more times each, meaning each rental costs Blockbuster fifty cents. Not to mention rent, surly clerks, cost of capital, advertising, etc. Or, in the case of Netflix, stamps.
In the case of online rentals, all of these intermediate costs immediately disappear. Gone.
So, why try to mimic the current model when it comes to pricing if the costs are mostly gone?
The same thing goes for online music and for PDF versions of books.Kevin Kellyfigured this out with his book on films. He makes $1.50 a copy regardless of whether you buy the beautiful color edition or the cheapest edition he sells. Why should he care which version you choose?
The current phone novelcrazein Japan is even more evidence for why this makes sense. 2,000,000 people download the phone novel you wrote (it costs you nothing) and then, when it becomes a hit, you make millions on the sales of the paper book and the movie…
No, I don’t thinkFreeis always the answer, but I do think the studios are about to make amistakeof RIAA proportions. I’d charge fifty cents for an online rental. It would immediately hammer the rental stores (which is fine with Hollywood) and DVD replicators (also fine with Hollywood) but would instantly teach people a new habit. Then, once the new habit is set and you’ve earned permission, sure, charge more for new movies and for blockbusters. 300 million movie theatres, all selling tickets every single night–you don’t need to charge $10 a seat when you have access to everyone.
It’s important to charge something, because the act of paying fundamentally changes the dynamics of the relationship. The question is this:at the start, is your goal to maximize profit or to build a platform that scales?The fact is that the market is too small right now for the price to matter. What matters is whether you can build an audience that is in the habit of paying you, an audience that wants to hear from you, an audience that you can build a business on.
At fifty cents a rental, all desire for piracy goes out the window, replaced by convenience, ease of use and a clear conscience. More important, entire new services show up, habits are built and the studios end up with a direct relationship with consumers who want to hear from them.Ifthey don’t get greedy at the start.",,"digital rentals, pricing strategy, consumer behavior"

The problem with perfect,"When was the last time you excitedly told someone about Fedex?
They’re perfect. The only time we notice them is when they screw up.
And that fancy restaurant with the four star reviews? They’ve got the fine linen and the coordinated presentation of dishes… it costs hundreds of dollars to eat there, but it’s okay, because they’re perfect.
Which is a problem, because dinner consists of not much except noticing how imperfect they are. The second course came five minutes later than it should of (ten, even!). The salad was really good, but not as perfect as it was last time. And the valet parking… you had to wait in the cold for at least ninety seconds before your car came. What a let down.
A let down?
The place is a gift, a positive bit of karma in a world filled with compromise. And all you can do is notice that it’s not perfect.
As the quality of things go up, and competition increases, it’s so easy to sell people on perfect. But perfect rarely leads to great word of mouth, merely because expectations are so hard to meet.
I think it’s more helpful to focus on texture, on interpersonal interaction, oninteresting.Interesting is attainable, and interesting is remarkable. Interesting is fresh every day and interesting leads to word of mouth.

So, where to draw the line?
If a product or service adds value for the consumer, it’s not a gimmick. Toll free customer support, for example, was seen as a gimmick when it came out in the 1960s. At least by competitors. Now, of course, it’s required.

On one visit, they had two full-time employees standing there, walking over to each door to close it. At the time, I figured it was actually a design feature… they had a doorman. How quaint.
Yesterday, though, with the temperature outside about 45, they just left both doors open.
I asked Jeff, the employee greeting visitors, ""why don’t you guys keep the door shut?"" After all, it seems extremely wasteful. Al Gore is on the board, but even if he wasn’t, it must be costing them a fortune.
Jeff told me that people complain all the time and it can’t be fixed.
Obviously, not everyone complains all the time. Perhaps it’s just a few a day. But the people who complain, care. And it’s the customers that care that actually have a huge impact on your business.

Vestiges,"Unless you just started, your organization is different than it used to be. It has evolved.
The marketing you do, the decisions you make, the hurdles you have to go through probably have vestiges of the old model. Sometimes, like the little feet on the back of a whale, it’s easy to ignore the vestiges. Other times, it’s entirely possibly that they prevent you from achieving your goals.
Example: years ago, Prodigy, the original big online service, reflected its origins from Sears, CBS and IBM when they unveiled chat and discussion boards. Every single message posted was read by a censor before it went online. At one point, they had literally hundreds of full time editors sitting in an office tower outside of NY, painstakingly reading every single post.
Example: the production values of an HD TV show are lost in the YouTube environment, yet plenty of studios and advertisers are having trouble giving up the staffing and hierarchy that served them so well in the other medium. So the vestiges remain, slowing down the entire process (and making it a lot more expensive.) 25 people to film a three minute clip is just silly, but it makes sense if you look back at how they got there.
Example: local banks with limited hours were the norm just a few years ago. The move to online hasn’t changed the way they all see the world… it’s a skeleton staff at night, because that’s the way it always was.
If you’re working hard to work around a vestige, maybe it makes sense to work just as hard to get rid of it all together.",,"Vestiges, Evolution, Organizational Change"

Crime,"Oded told me about a major websitevandalizingthe Consumer Electronics Show by turning off TV monitors using a remote control. They took down entire walls of monitors and interrupted presentations.
Sorry, guys, but this is just like shoplifting or spam or breaking windows. It’s not ‘no big deal’, it’s a very big deal. Here’s why:
First, in a society where we make concepts, services and ideas as opposed to stuff, breaking that process is identical to breaking the stuff was back then. In other words, it’s vandalism.
Worse, what happens when everyone does it? I remember getting my first piece of spam in 1995 or so. Back then, one piece a day was no big deal. But 500 people at CES would be enough to bring the entire show down. Can I protect my monitor with a piece of black electrical tape? Sure. But why should I have to give up using my (authorized) remote in order to put on a public display that people are actually paying to see? When there’s two or three or five people at every movie with a laser pointer, the movie is no longer fun to watch.
Here’s the downside of the openness that the Web is promoting: the next group of people coming online from around the world will have a lot more to gain by gaming the system, by running confidence games, by spamming comments, by figuring out how to rip you off… It’s a lot easier to leave the doors of your house unlocked when you live in a remote village–one where everyone knows your name.
If the standard of the culture we’re building online is already low, then it makes it even easier for organized crime (and just plain disorganized scammers) to have a serious impact on the rest of us.Anonymityis the enemy, whether it’s online or walking around a trade show with a clicker in your pocket.

I gave at the office,"Mark Rovner has an insightfulpostabout the current state of fundraising and non-profits.
The short version: most big charities are based on direct mail fundraising, and as you’re read here before, direct mail is dying. What to do?
I’ll start with the bad news: I despair for most of the top 50 non-profits in the US. These are the big guys, and they’re stuck. Unlike the Fortune 100, not known for being cutting edge in themselves, the top charities rarely change… if you’re big, you’re used to being big and you expect to stay big. That means that generation after generation of staff has been hired to keep doing what’s working. Big risks and crazy schemes are certainly frowned upon.
The good news is this: the Internet is not a replacement for direct mail fundraising. It is, in fact, something much bigger than that for just about every non-profit.
As soon as commerce started online, many non-profits discovered lots of income from their websites. This was mistakenly chalked up to brilliant conversion and smart marketing. In fact, it was just technologically advanced donors using a more convenient method to send in money they would have sent in anyway.
The big win is in changing the very nature of what it means to support a charity. The idea of ""I gave at the office"" and of giving money in the last week in December speaks to obligation. Many people donate to satisfy a guilty feeling, or to please a friend. This doesn’t scale. Not one bit. It’s super easy to ignore a direct mail solicitation when all you have to do is hit delete and no one notices.
The big win is in turning donors into patrons and activists and participants. The biggest donors are the ones who not only give, but do the work. The ones who make the soup or feed the hungry or hang the art. My mom was a volunteer for years at the Albright Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York, and there’s no doubt at all that we gave more money to the museum than we would have if they’d sent us a flyer once a month.
The internet allows some organizations to embrace long-distance involvement. It lets charitiesflip the funnel, not through some simple hand waving, but by reorganizing around the idea of engagement online. It means opening yourself up to volunteers, encouraging them to network, to connect with each other, and yes, even to mutiny. It means giving every one of your professionals a blog and the freedom to use it. It means mixing it up with volunteers, so they have something truly at stake. This is understandably scary for many non-profits, but I’m not so sure you have a choice.
Do you have to abandon the old ways today? Of course not. But responsible stewardship requires that you find and empower the mavericks and give them the flexibility to build something new, not to try to force the internet to act like direct mail with free stamps.","January 9, 2008","fundraising, non-profits, donor engagement"
Dumbing down,"""Our readers won’t understand this.""
""Our customers are too busy and won’t get this.""
""The people who come to our restaurant want red meat.""
""No one is going to want something this good…""
Think about the stuff you hear on the radio or read about in mass market publications. When they attempt to cover something you really know about, they seem pretty stupid, don’t they? Oversimplifying to the point of getting it completely wrong. They’re busy pandering to the masses, dumbing things down for the lowest common denominator.
You’re under pressure to do that with your restaurant and your spiritual advice and your stump speech and your non-profit pitch. There are gatekeepers pushing you to dumb it down for the average.
The thing is, when you dumb stuff down, you know what you get?
Dumb customers.
And (I’m generalizing here) dumb customers don’t spend as much, don’t talk as much, don’t blog as much, don’t vote as much and don’t evangelize as much. In other words, they’re the worst ones to end up with.

I was talking to someone yesterday about naming books, and I realized that there are three useful schools of thought here.

Music lessons,"Things you can learn from the music business (as it falls apart)
The first rule is so important, it’s rule 0:
0. The new thing is never as good as the old thing, at least right now.Soon, the new thing will be better than the old thing will be. But if you wait until then, it’s going to be too late.  Feel free to wax nostalgic about the old thing, but don’t fool yourself into believing it’s going to be here forever. It won’t.
1. Past performance is no guarantee of future successEvery single industry changes and, eventually, fades. Just because you made money doing something a certain way yesterday, there’s no reason to believe you’ll succeed at it tomorrow.
The music business had a spectacular run alongside the baby boomers. Starting with the Beatles and Dylan, they just kept minting money. The co-incidence of expanding purchasing power of teens along with the birth of rock, the invention of the transistor and changing social mores meant a long, long growth curve.
As a result, the music business built huge systems. They created top-heavy organizations, dedicated superstores, a loss-leader touring industry, extraordinarily high profit margins, MTV and more. It was a well-greased system, but the key question: why did it deserve to last forever?
It didn’t. Yours doesn’t either.
2. Copy protection in a digital age is a pipe dreamIf the product you make becomes digital, expect that the product you make will be copied.
There’s a paradox in the music business that is mirrored in many industries: you want ubiquity, not obscurity, yet digital distribution devalues your core product.
Remember, the music business is the one that got in trouble for bribing disk jockeys to play their music on the radio. They are the ones that spent millions to make (free) videos for MTV. And yet once the transmission became digital, they understood that there’s not a lot of reason to buy a digital version (via a cumbersome expensive process) when the digital version is free (and easier).
Most items of value derive that value from scarcity. Digital changes that, and you can derive value from ubiquity now.
The solution isn’t to somehow try to become obscure, to get your song off the (digital) radio. The solution is to change your business.
You used to sell plastic and vinyl. Now, you can sell interactivity and souvenirs.
3. Interactivity can’t be copiedProducts that are digital and also include interaction thrive on centralization and do better and better as the market grows in size (consider Facebook or Basecamp).
Music is social. Music is current and everchanging. And most of all, music requires musicians. The winners in the music business of tomorrow are individuals and organizations that create communities, connect people, spread ideas and act as the hub of the wheel… indispensable and well-compensated.
4.Permissionis the asset of the futureFor generations, businesses had no idea who their end users were. No ability to reach through the record store and figure out who was buying that Rolling Stones album, no way to know who bought this book or that vase.
Today, of course,permissionis an asset to be earned. The ability (not the right, but the privilege) of delivering anticipated, personal and relevant messages to people who want to get them. For ten years, the music business has been steadfastly avoiding this opportunity.
It’s interesting though, because many musicians have NOT been avoiding it. Many musicians have understood that all they need to make a (very good) living is to have 10,000 fans. 10,000 people who look forward to the next record, who are willing to trek out to the next concert. Add 7 fans a day and you’re done in 5 years. Set for life. A life making music for your fans, not finding fans for your music.
The opportunity of digital distribution is this:
When you can distribute something digitally, for free, it will spread (if it’s good). If it spreads, you can use it as a vehicle to allow people to come back to you and register, to sign up, to give you permission to interact and to keep them in the loop.
Many authors (I’m on that list) have managed to build an entire career around this idea. So have management consultants and yes, insurance salespeople. Not by viewing the spread of digital artifacts as an inconvenient tactic, but as the core of their new businesses.
5. A frightened consumer is not a happy consumer.I shouldn’t have to say this, but here goes: suing people is like going to war. If you’re going to go to war with tens of thousands of your customers every year, don’t be surprised if they start treating you like the enemy.
6. This is a big one: The best time to change your business model is while you still have momentum.It’s not so easy for an unknown artist to start from scratch and build a career self-publishing. Not so easy for her to find fans, one at a time, and build an audience. Very, very easy for a record label or a top artist to do so. So, the time to jump was yesterday. Too late. Okay, how about today?
The sooner you do it, the more assets and momentum you have to put to work.
7. Remember the Bob Dylan rule: it’s not just a record, it’s a movement.Bob and his handlers have a long track record of finding movements. Anti-war movements, sure, but also rock movies, the Grateful Dead, SACDs, Christian rock and Apple fanboys. What Bob has done (and I think he’s done it sincerely, not as a calculated maneuver) is seek out groups that want to be connected and he works to become the connecting the point.
By being open to choices of format, to points of view, to moments in time, Bob Dylan never said, “I make vinyl records that cost money to listen to.” He understands at some level that music is often the soundtrack for something else.
I think the same thing can be true for chefs and churches and charities and politicians and makers of medical devices. People pay a premium for a story, every time.
8. Don’t panic when the new business model isn’t as ‘clean’ as the old oneIt’s not easy to give up the idea of manufacturing CDs with a 90% gross margin and switching to a blended model of concerts and souvenirs, of communities and greeting cards and special events and what feels like gimmicks. I know.
Get over it. It’s the only option if you want to stay in this business. You’re just not going to sell a lot of CDs in five years, are you?
If there’s a business here, first few in will find it, the rest lose everything.
9. Read the writing on the wall.Hey, guys, I’m not in the music business and even I’ve been writing about this for years. I even started a record label five years ago to make the point. Industries don’t die by surprise. It’s not like you didn’t know it was coming. It’s not like you didn’t know who to call (orhire).
This isn’t about having a great idea (it almost never is). The great ideas are out there, for free, on your neighborhood blog. Nope, this is about taking initiative and making things happen.
The last person to leave the current record business won’t be the smartest and he won’t be the most successful, either. Getting out first and staking out the new territory almost always pays off.
10. Don’t abandon the Long TailEveryone in the hit business thinks they understand the secret: just make hits. After all, if you do the math, it shows that if you just made hits, you’d be in fat city.
Of course, the harder you try to just make hits, the less likely you are to make any hits at all. Movies, records, books… the blockbusters always seem to be surprises. Surprise hit cookbooks, even.
Instead, in an age when it’s cheaper than ever to design something, to make something, to bring something to market, the smart strategy is to have a dumb strategy. Keep your costs low and go with your instincts, even when everyone says you’re wrong. Do a great job, not a perfect one. Bring things to market, the right market, and let them find their audience.
Stick to the knitting has never been more wrong. Instead, find products your customers want. Don’t underestimate them. They’re more catholic in their tastes than you give them credit for.
11. Understand the power of  digitalTry to imagine something like this happening ten years ago: An eleven-year-old kid wakes up on a Saturday morning, gets his allowance, then, standing in his pajamas, buys a Bon Jovi song for a buck.
Compare this to hassling for a ride, driving to the mall, finding the album in question, finding the $14 to pay for it and then driving home.
You may believe that your business doesn’t lend itself to digital transactions. Many do. If you’ve got a business that doesn’t thrive on digital, it might not grow as fast as you like… Maybe you need to find a business that does thrive on digital.
12. Celebrity is underratedThe music business has always created celebrities. And each celebrity has profited for decades from that fame. Frank Sinatra is dead and he’s still profiting. Elvis is still alive and he’s certainly still profiting.
The music business has done a poor job of leveraging that celebrity and catching the value it creates. Many businesses now have the power to create their own micro-celebrities. These individuals capture attention and generate trust, two critical elements in growing profits.
13. Value is created when you go from many to few, and vice versaThe music business has thousands of labels and tens of thousands of copyright holders. It’s a mess.
And there’s just one iTunes music store. Consolidation pays.
At the same time, there are other industries where there are just a few major players and the way to profit is to create splinters and niches.
13. Whenever possible, sell subscriptionsFew businesses can successfully sell subscriptions (magazines being the very best example), but when you can, the whole world changes. HBO, for example, is able to spend its money making shows for its viewers rather than working to find viewers for every show.
The biggest opportunity for the music business is to combine permission with subscription. The possibilities are endless. And I know it’s hard to believe, but the good old days are yet to happen.","January 7, 2008","music business, digital transformation, business model"
Editors,"Turns out that for the lastseventeentwenty-seven years, every single movie that managed to win the Oscar for best picture was also nominated for best editing.

Consider Iowa. Caucus turnout was huge. And yet it only represents a tiny percentage of the people who vote in the actual election in Iowa. What? The caucus stage is so much more important in the scheme of things (the Iowa electoral vote essentially never influences an election). So why skip the caucus?
90% of voters skip it because they don’t want to stand up in front of people and tell them who they’re voting for. They don’t want to be challenged or made to look foolish. So they keep quiet.
That’s what most of your customers do. They lay low, because they’re afraid or shy or just not used to talking about brands and products or experiences.
Sure,1%of your customers blog or post or just plain talk. They’re louder than ever before. But the other 99% represent a real opportunity for you. Figure out how to get them out there. Cajole them to go to a caucus.","January 4, 2008","Word of mouth, consumer behavior, customer engagement"
Making promises,"Is that what marketing is all about?
I think so.
Make promises and keep them.
Some organizations work very hard to weasel in the promises they make. They imply great customer service or amazing results or spectacular quality, but don’t deliver. No, they didn’t actually lie, but they came awfully close. The result: angry customers and negative word of mouth.
It’s very easy to overpromise. Tempting to shade the truth a little bit, deliver a little bit less to save a few bucks. Who will notice?
The consumer notices.

Blogs and self promotion,"A few years ago, Oprah sold her autobiography to a major New York publisher. You can imagine the delight among booksellers.
At the last minute, she backed out, never really explaining why.
I wonder how many books she would have sold? A lot, certainly, but as many as the titles she regularly promotes?
Here is a fascinating statistic:
Last month, I posted excerpts frommy new book. I also wrote a glowingpostabout Garr’s new book on presentations.   Guess what? My stats show that I sold more copies of Garr’s book than mine.
The truism of the web:people talking about you is far more effective than talking about yourself.
Clearly, just about everyone who reads my blog enjoys my writing. You’d think that a significant percentage would then hustle over to buy a copy onAmazonthe moment they heard about it. But, just as Oprah is at her best when she’s talking about somebody else’s book, something funny happens when a blogger talks about his work.
CoryandMarkboth have terrific books out. And as co-editors on the world’s most popular blog, you’d think that they could use boingboing to sell a ton of books. But it doesn’t happen. Lucky for bloggers, if you write a good book, a few other bloggers will write about you and then the sales start happening.
Once again, what do you know, it takes patience. It’s not a direct, first-order promotional thing, the way old media is. Instead, it’s one thing causing something else, which leads to a conversation and then, maybe, a sale.

Solving problems,"There are three ways to deal with a problem, I think.
You leanintoa problem, especially a long-term or difficult one, by sitting with it, reveling in it, embracing it and breathing it in. The problem becomes part of you, at least until you solve it. You try one approach and then another, and when nothing works, you stick with it and work around it as you build your organization and your life. [I don’t mean you just bully the problem, or attack it. I mean that you accept it, live with it, breathe it and whittle it until you’ve achieved your goal. Once you start looking forward to your interactions with the problem, then you’re leaning into it.]
Some people choose to leanawayfrom the problems that nag them at home or at work. They avoid them, minimize them or criticize the cause. Put as little into it as possible and maybe it will go away.
And sometimes, a problem is so nasty or overwhelming that you just run away.
I’m a big fan of the first approach. And sometimes, quitting isn’t such a bad idea. The second approach, alas, is the one that many of us end up with by default, and the one that’s least likely to pay off.

May I have your attention please,"or perhaps
MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE!
Of course, I can’thaveyour attention. I could borrow it or earn it or if I use all caps, offend you and demand it.
The most precious commodity on a momentary basis is attention. Each moment occurs only once, and if a marketer just takes it, we’re understandably annoyed. There is no refund window for misused attention…
Which leads to the idea of free. In case you’ve been living under a rock, Chris Anderson has just unveiled the outline of the key arguments in his brilliant new book aboutFREE.
This is well worth a read. I’ve written about free on this blog about600times, so I think it’s a pretty important topic.
One reason is the cost side, which Chris writes about so eloquently, but another reason has to do with attention. If you want someone’s attention, I’m afraid you’re going to have to earn it. To pay for it. To do something that makes the person who just gave you this attention feel like a fair bargain was struck.
You can do that by creating a remarkable service or product. You can do it by paying them with cash. Or you can do it with free. Free undermines the typical human’s proclivity to ignore every offer. Even if it’s a penny, we’ll ignore it. Free changes that. In other words, buying attention is a marketing expense, and one way to budget for that is to deduct it from the cost of your product. As Tim O’Reilly says, piracy is not the enemy, obscurity is.
The interesting thing about most products and services is that we won’t buy them until we know what they are and what they do. And often the best and only way to do that is to use them. For some products (like music) using them once and owning them are very close to the same thing. Hence, free. You can view that as a problem or you can see it as an opportunity. Up to you.
Marketing is not advertising, not any more. It is often found in the way you make something, talk about it and yes, price it.",,"Attention, Free, Marketing"
Thinking about Dustin Hoffman,"I’m sitting here on the plane watching The Graduate, a movie I’m surprised I’ve never seen before. There, on the big (little) screen up front is Mr. Magorium’s Emporium, a movie I’m glad I’ve never seen before. Same Dustin Hoffman, of course, separated by forty years or so.
It’s unusual to be able to watch someone’s career develop over that long a period of time.
But now, in the age of blogs and a million channels and the social graph, I wonder how unusual that really is. I had coffee at a party with Soledad O’Brien ten years ago and now I see her on TV announcing election results. I started readingRich’sstartup blog a few years ago, readingTom Peterstwenty five (!) years ago and emailing with some of my colleagues almost as long ago.

Marketing in a recession,"When times are good, buying things is a sport. It’s a reward. The story we tell ourselves is that we deserve it, that we want it and why not?
When the mass psychology changes and times are seen as not so good, the story we tell ourselves changes as well. Now, we buy out of defense, to avoid trouble. Or we buy because something will never be as cheap again. Or we buy smaller items for the same sense of reward.
Of course, the two different extremes can lead you to buy the very same thing. It’s not the thing so much as it’s the story.
Starbucks was the indulgence of a confident person happy to blow $4 on a cup of coffee. Starbucks can become the small indulgence for the person who just traded down to a small rented apartment.
The challenge for marketers is to figure out how to change the story they are living so that their customers can change the story they tell themselves. What you make, where you make it, who makes it, how it’s priced and sold and … it all adds up to a perception. If you change these elements the story will change too.","February 24, 2008","Marketing, recession, consumer psychology"
Advice for real estate agents (quit now!),"I had the good fortune to speak to a large gathering of real estate agents last week. Here’s my best advice (everyone knows an agent or two, so feel free to forward this along).
Plan A:You should quit selling real estate.
I’m serious.
Quit being an agent. Get a job doing something else.
Some of you have been waiting to hear that. My pleasure.
…
Now, if you’re still with me, you’ll be glad to know that the competition for attention just got smaller. The agents who built their business on low interest rates, easy money and speculation (the order takers) have left the building.
The ones that are left, that’s you, can considerPlan B:
If you’re not going to be able to make a living by taking orders, by selling houses the way everyone else does, by using the never-ending rise in real estate prices to make sales, then what are you going to do? Whining is not an option.
In fact, I think this is an extraordinary opportunity for you.
Without a frenzy, without short-term competition, you can actually build assets that will pay off for the long run. I have two in mind:
The first is to becometheexpert in what you do. Which means micro-specialization. Who is the single-best agent for condos in your zip code? Or for single family homes for large families? Who is the one and the only best person to turn to if you’re looking for investment property in this part of town?
As I wrote inThe Dip, you’re either the best in the world (where ‘world’ can be a tiny slice of the environment) or you’re invisible.
This means being Draconian in your choices. No, you can’t also do a little of this or a little of that. Best in your world means burning your other bridges and obsessing.
""I have no time!""
Of course you have that time available. Remember nine months ago when you were three times as busy with incoming calls as you are now? Invest that time in building up your expertise and becoming the person people who don’t even like you turn to for insight.
Or, consider this: Take half your office (the half made vacant by the people following Plan A) and turn it over to local groups. Let the active (and nascent) clubs and organizations meet in your office. Not once in a while. Regularly. All the time. Become the hub. Because, after all, you’re the mayor.
The second asset to build is permission. It turns out (according to the NAR) that 91% of all Realtors never contact the buyer or the seller of a home after the closing. Not once. Wow. Someone just spent a million dollars with you and you don’t bother to call or write?
The opportunity during the current pause (and yes, it’s a pause) is to find, one by one, the people who would benefit from hearing from you and thenearnthe right to talk to them. Earn the right to send them a newsletter or a regular update or a subscription to your blog. NOT to talk about what matters to you, but to give them information (real information, not just data) that matters tothem.Visitdailycandy.comto see an example of what people like to hear.
The opportunity is to reinvent the way you interact with citizens, with prospects, with the mildly interested and with your past clients. The opportunity, in other words, is to stop waiting around for the phone to ring and instead figure out how to do what you do best… connect buyers and sellers in a way that makes them both confident.
Some of you will stick with the standard business card with the standard photo, the standard office and the standard ad strategy and the standard approach to making the phone ring. It’s going to be a long haul if that’s your route.
I’m betting, though, that the best of you will end up with a business model that will survive, thrive and prosper. Best time to start is right now.","February 22, 2008","real estate, expertise, opportunity"

Marketing HR,"Yesterday’s post led to some good email about Human Resources.
Understand that in days of yore, factories consisted of people and machines. The goal was to use more machines, fewer people, and to design processes so that the people were interchangeable, low cost and easily replaced. The more leverage the factory-owner had, the better. Hence Personnel or the even more cruel term: HR. It views people as a natural resource, like lumber.
Like it or not, in most organizations HR has grown up with a forms/clerical/factory focus. Which was fine, I guess, unless your goal was to do something amazing, something that had nothing to do with a factory, something that required amazing programmers, remarkable marketers or insanely talented strategy people.
So, here’s my small suggestion, one that will make some uncomfortable.
Change the department name to Talent.
The reason this makes some people uncomfortable is that it seems like spin, like gratuitous double speak. And, if you don’t change what you do, that would be true.
BUT…
What if you started acting like the VP of Talent? Understanding that talent is hard to find and not obvious to manage. The VP of Talent would have to reorganize the department and do things differently all day long (small example: talent shouldn’t have to fill out reams of forms and argue with the insurance company… talent is too busy for that… talent has people to help with that.)
Microsoft and Google both have a very healthy focus on finding and recruiting Talent. McDonald’s recently announced that they want to hire people who smile more. The first strategy works, the second won’t. Talent is too smart to stay long at a company that wants it to be a cog in a machine. Great companies want and need talent, but they have to work for it.","February 19, 2008","Talent, Human Resources, Recruitment"

Citizens,"What do you call the people that marketers interact with? The ones who aren’t customers yet…
I was talking with Dan Pink on a conference call earlier and werealized that ""prospect"" or ""target market"" are very marketing-centricterms. The person is defined by the marketer, not the other way around.
Isn’t it interesting that there isn’t even a name for someone who doesn’t yet have a relationship with the marketer?
We settled on citizen. (Jackie and Ben used a variant on this in their latestbook.)
Citizenrecognized the power of this individual. Citizens are nolonger the weak, isolated pre-consumers in front of a TV set in 1971,with few options. Now, citizens appear to be holding all the cards. Itsounds a bit pretentious, but then, so do most terms marketers use.
When you stop calling people ‘targets’ or ‘prospects’ and start calling them ‘guests’ or ‘citizens’, you can’t help but become a little more humble and a little more respectful. Try it, it works.

Stressed,"Like most creatures, people are stressed out. Almost all the time. And when we’re not, we seek out adventures and interactions to make us stressed. We get stressed about money, reputation, safety, relationships and whether we have to move our seat on the plane after we get on.
Stress is an essential part of the human condition. It rises when we’re about to buy something or sell something or interact with someone. We spend money to avoid it and we spend money to embrace it. And we almost never talk about it.
That thing you’re marketing… Does it add to stress or take it away? Is it stressful to talk about it? Buy it? Get rid of it? Is it more stressfulnotto buy it than it is to go ahead and buy one? Does it promise to reduce stress, but end up causing more?

The posture of a communicator,"If you buy my product but don’t read the instructions, that’s not your fault, it’s mine.If you read a blog post and misinterpret what I said, that’s my choice, not your error.If you attend my presentation and you’re bored, that’s my failure.If you are a student in my class and you don’t learn what I’m teaching, I’ve let you down.
It’s really easy to insist that people read the friggin manual. It’s really easy to blame the user/student/prospect/customer for not trying hard, for being too stupid to get it or for not caring enough to pay attention. Sometimes (often) that might even be a valid complaint. But it’s not helpful.
What’s helpful is to realize that you have a choice when you communicate. You can design your products to be easy to use. You can write so your audience hears you. You can present in a place and in a way that guarantees that the people you want to listen will hear you. Most of all, you get to choose who will understand (and who won’t).","February 15, 2008","communication, responsibility, audience engagement"

Profligate,"When I walked into my hotel room the other night, I was amazed to discover that no less than 18 lights were on (all traditional bulbs) and that the heat was set on three different thermostats to a toasty 75 degrees in honor of winter.
Then, when I got home, the $125 watch I had ordered from Amazon was waiting for me. The box for the watch contained four pamphlets, a small velvet bag, a cleaning cloth and was more than 10 inches by 3 inches by 3 inches in size. It weighed well over a pound–just the presentation box, not the watch.
In both cases, I don’t think I would have noticed or cared just a few years ago. Today, both feel wrong. Not all of your customers will feel this way.

The Placebo Affect*,"[*spelled wrong on purpose. This post is from three years ago, and I thought it was worth another look:]
Everybody already knows how powerful the brain is. Take a sugar pillthat’s supposed to be a powerful medicine and watch your symptomsdisappear. Have a surgeon not perform bypass surgery on your heart (link.) and discover that the angina that has been crippling you vanishes.
Theplacebo effectis not just for sick people anymore.
Why do some ideas have more currency than others? Because we believethey should. When Chris Anderson or Malcolm Gladwell writes aboutsomething, it’s a better idea becausetheywrote about it.
Even as your culture of ideas and marketing enters its long–tail,open-source, low-barrier, everyone-has-a-blog era of mass publication,we still need filters. Would your iPod sound as sweet if everyone elsehad a Rio? Would your Manolo Blahniks be as cool if everyone else werewearing Keds?
Arthur Anderson audited thousands of companies, and those audits gave us confidence in those companies, made themappearmore solid, which, not surprisingly,madethem more solid. Then, post Enron, the placebo effect disappeared. Samecompanies, same auditors, but suddenly those companies appeared LESSsolid, which made them less solid.
The magic of the placebo effect lies in the fact that you can’t doit to yourself. You need an accomplice. Someone in authority who willvoluntarily tell you a story.
That’s what marketers do. We have the“placebo affect.”(* The knack for creating placebos.) Of course, we need to persuadeourselves that it’s morally and ethically and financially okay toparticipate in something as unmeasurable as the placebo effect. Theeffect is controversial and it goes largely unspoken. Very rarely do wecome to meetings and say, “well, here’s our cool new PBX for Fortune1000 companies. It’s exactly the same as the last model, except thephones are designed by frog design so they’re cooler and moreapproachable and people are more likely to invest a few minutes inlearning how to use them, so customer satisfaction will go up and we’llsell more, even though it’s precisely the same technology we wereselling yesterday.”
Very rarely do vodka marketers tell the truth and say, “here’s ournew vodka, which we buy in bulk from the same distillery that producesvodka for $8 a bottle. Ours is going to cost $35 a bottle and come in areally, really nice bottle and our ads will persuade laddies that thiswill help them in the dating department… nudge, nudge, know what Imean, nudge, nudge…”
It would be surprising to meet a monk or a talmudic scholar or aminister who would say, “yes, we burn the incense or turn down thelights or ring these bells or light these candles as a way of creatinga room where people are more likely to believe in their prayers,” butof course that’s exactly what they’re doing. (and you know what?there’s nothing wrong with that.)
It’s easier to get people to come to a meeting about clock speed andwarranty failure analysis than it is to have a session aboutstorytelling.
We don’t like to admit that we tell stories, that we’re in theplacebo business. Instead, we tell ourselves about features andbenefits as a way to rationalize our desire to to help our customers byallowing them to lie to themselves.
The design of your blog or your package or your outfit is nothingbut an affect designed to create the placebo effect. The sound Dasaniwater makes when you open the bottle is more of the same. It’s allstorytelling. It’s all lies.
Not that there’s anything wrong with that.
In fact, your marketplace insists on it.","February 12, 2008","Placebo effect, storytelling, marketing"

Jeff Jarvis points us to anew featurein Google Docs. Think this through for a moment:You send an email to your permission list. It points to a spreadsheet online. People can fill it out without logging in. You get the summarized data back, and can present it as a chart, a graph or just run with the numbers themselves. The depth of analysis you can generate is far deeper than a simple poll. My guess is that 99% of the people who use it will do a simple one dimensional poll. It’s more powerful than that.
Now, what else do we need?
How about a simple system that lets you run a new kind of auction for an event with limited seating? Say you want 200 people to come to a networking event, the sort of thing that’s no fun if only a dozen or two show up… Instead of charging $50 a ticket, why not charge $1 for the first five tickets, $2 for the next five, and on to $500 for the last ten? You’ll earn just as much (if not more) but reward the brave who sign up early. (The folks who like to wait until the last minute ‘to be sure’ end up paying for the privilege). It’s easy to imagine a simple interface to set up whatever graduated pricing model you’d like.
Or, how about a geography-based system for pricing? Many services are sold by a flat fee, but add a zip code and a map and it could completely change the pricing model.
Why don’t airlines have tools in place to make it easy to integrate charter flights with conventions so flights run when (and where) people are going? Flights for passengers instead of passengers for flights…

Food = Fun,"Many of us want fun and respect and love and success and kindness and hope. What brilliant marketers do is add the =.
A hundred years ago, food wasn’t much of an industry. Today, packaged, profitable, processed food has transformed every element of our culture.
The Super Bowl is a food holiday. Visit (if you must) the local supermarket on a Sunday morning before the big game. That’s the primary function of the event… to eat processed foods and beverages while hanging out with a group of people. Bonding via shared junk.
Same with a typical birthday party. Kids get validation from their friends (you came) and from their parents (yay, we get to eat junk.)
It’s not an accident that fried corn, sugared beverages, semi-trans fats and white flour have become essential parts of our culture. You can’t get elected in Iowa without pigging out at the Fair and you can’t host a party without stocking up on the chips. Somehow, food marketing became a story about respect. Few people say, ""it’ll be fun… I’ll make a big bowl of brown rice and serve oatmeal cookies I made from scratch."" Too weird. Too risky. People might not like you if you challenge the food dynamic.
There’s always been a cultural desire to conform. The difference is that now there’s money at stake, so marketers push us to conform in ways that turn a profit.
Marketers, brilliant, profit-oriented marketers, have had a century to teach us to associate respect and kindness and love with certain kinds of food.
And that’s why this post isn’t just a screed, it’s a lesson for marketers everywhere.
…Just as the jewelry and floral people have taught us that flowers and diamonds=love and that a respectable gentleman spends two months salary (!) on an engagement ring. Not an accident, of course. It’s too risky, marketers teach us, to send a handmade card or skip the jewelry and buy a research grant or pay for part of a school.
…Just as the car you drive somehow says something about who you are.
…Just as the college-industrial complex has taught us that the best colleges are the ones that are the most expensive (making them the hardest to get into, furthering the cycle),
…you have the opportunity to start down this road with what you make.
So I’m hoping that what you make is worthy. Marketing is a powerful tool especially when it associates a product with a desire and instinct we already have.
Marketing, when it works, transcends any discussion of the benefits of the product or the service.
Marketing, instead, is about the equal sign.

Soggy,"New organizations and new projects are so crisp.
Things happen with alacrity. Decisions get made. Stuff gets done.
Then, over time, things get soggy. They slow down. Decisions aren’t so black and white any more.
Why?
Here are some things that happen:1. Every initiative, post launch, still has a tail of activity associated with it. Launch enough things and over time, that tail gets bigger and bigger.
2. Most projects either succeed or fail. Successful projects raise the stakes, because the team doesn’t want to blow it. There are more people watching, more dollars at stake, things matter more. So things inevitably get more review, more analysis and slow down. Projects that fail sap the confidence of the group. They want to be extra sure that they’re right this time, so, ironically, they slow down and end up sabotaging the new work.
3. The paper isn’t blank any more. Which means that new decisions often mean overturning old decisions, which means you need to acknowledge that it didn’t used to be as good as it was.
4. And the biggest thing is that there is a status quo. Something to compare everything to.
I’m not sure you can eliminate any of these issues. But, you can realize that they’re there. And you can be really strict about priorities and deadlines… it’s so easy to let things slip, rather than confronting the fact that you’re stuck and probably afraid.

Over the last few decades, I’ve probably launched 500 products and services. And I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone talk about how organizations go about deciding what to make and what to shelve. How do you decide where to invest your scarce people and promotional resources?

"Fear, hope and love: the three marketing levers","Where does love come from? Brand love?
The TSA is in the fear business. Every time they get you take off your shoes, they’re using fear (of the unknown or perhaps of missing your plane) to get you take action.
Chanel is in the hope business. How else to get you to spend $5,000 a gallon for perfume?
Hope can be something as trivial as convenience. I hope that this smaller size of yogurt will save me time or get a smile out of my teenager…
And love? Love gets you to support a candidate even when he screws up or changes his mind on a position or disagrees with you on another one. Love incites you to protest when they change the formula for Coke, or to cry out in delight when you see someone at the market wearing a Google t-shirt.
People take action (mostly) based on one of three emotions:
FearHopeLove
Every successful marketer (including politicians) takes advantage of at least one of these basic needs.
Forbes Magazine, for example, is for people who hope to make more money.
Rudy Giuliani was the fear candidate. He tried to turn fear into love, but failed.
Few products or services succeed out of love. People are too selfish for an emotion that selfless, most of the time.
It’s interesting to think about the way certain categories gravitate to various emotions. Doctors selling check ups, of course, are in the fear business (while oncologists certainly sell hope). Restaurants have had a hard time selling fear (healthy places don’t do so well). Singles bars certainly thrive on selling hope.
Google, amazingly quickly, became a beloved brand, something many people see as bigger than themselves, something bigger than hope. Apple lives in this arena as well. I think if you deliver hope for a long time (and deliver on it sometimes) you can graduate to love. Ronald Reagan was beloved, even when he was making significantlong-termerrors. So wasJFK.Hillary may be respected, but Obama is loved.
I don’t think love is often a one way street, either. Brands that are loved usually start the process by loving their customers in advance.
The easiest way to build a brand is to sell fear. The best way, though, may be to deliver on hope while aiming for love…","February 4, 2008","Fear, Hope, Love"

Of course, it’s a silly question, since if an admin were secretly responding to my mail, a question like this certainly doesn’t end the subterfuge. You’d need to do something like ask inNavajoor some secret code.
Anyway, I don’t have a staff. It’s just me. (Though having a staff seems to work really well forTim.)
Which leads tothis post.I don’t use Twitter.It’s not really me.I also don’t actively use FaceBook, and I’m not adding any friends, though I still have an account for the day when I no doubt will. I also don’t use Flickr or MySpace or Meebo.
My reasoning is simple, and it has two parts. First, I don’t want to use a tool unless I’m going to use it really well. Doing any of these things halfway is worse than not at all. People don’t want a mediocre interaction. Second, I don’t want to add a layer of staff between me and the tools I use and the people I interact with. I think both of these ideas go together, and unfortunately, they’re also a paradox. If you want to be in multiple social media and also have a day job, you’re going to need a staff. Scoble is the poster child for being everywhere, all the time, but it’s all he does.
In 1993, we installed a primitive form of chat on our network at work. I think it was called SnapMail. I discovered pretty quickly that I was spending three or four hours a day using it. I was really good at it. And I also didn’t get as much done as I needed to. So we ripped it out. Just because it was stimulating doesn’t meant it helped with our goal.

Better than Free,"Kevin Kelly has a fantastic (no surprise) riff about free.Highly recommended.
His point: when there are infinite copies of something, charging for one is almost impossible.
Here are his eight ways of making something worth charging for:
Immediacy— Sooner or later you canfind a free copy of whatever you want, but getting a copy delivered toyour inbox the moment it is released — or even better, produced — byits creators is a generative asset. Many people go to movie theaters tosee films on the opening night, where they will pay a hefty price tosee a film that later will be available for free, or almost free, viarental or download. Hardcover books command a premium for theirimmediacy, disguised as a harder cover. First in line often commands anextra price for the same good. As a sellable quality, immediacy hasmany levels, including access to beta versions. Fans are brought intothe generative process itself. Beta versions are often de-valuedbecause they are incomplete, but they also possess generative qualitiesthat can be sold. Immediacy is a relative term, which is why it isgenerative. It has to fit with the product and the audience. A blog hasa different sense of time than a movie, or a car. But immediacy can befound in any media.
Personalization— A generic version of a concertrecording may be free, but if you want a copy that has been tweaked tosound perfect in your particular living room — as if it were preformedin your room — you may be willing to pay a lot.  The free copy of abook can be custom edited by the publishers to reflect your ownprevious reading background. A free movie you buy may be cut to reflectthe rating you desire (no violence, dirty language okay). Aspirin isfree, but aspirin tailored to your DNA is very expensive. As many havenoted, personalization requires an ongoing conversation between thecreator and consumer, artist and fan, producer and user. It is deeplygenerative because it is iterative and time consuming. You can’t copythe personalization that a relationship represents. Marketers call that""stickiness"" because it means both sides of the relationship are stuck(invested) in this generative asset, and will be reluctant to switchand start over.
Interpretation— As the old joke goes: software,free. The manual, $10,000. But it’s no joke. A couple of high profilecompanies, like Red Hat, Apache, and others make their living doingexactly that. They provide paid support for free software. The copy ofcode, being mere bits, is free — and becomes valuable to you onlythrough the support and guidance. I suspect a lot of geneticinformation will go this route. Right now getting your copy of your DNAis very expensive, but soon it won’t be. In fact, soon pharmaceuticalcompanies will PAY you to get your genes sequence. So the copy of yoursequence will be free, but the interpretation of what it means, whatyou can do about it, and how to use it — the manual for your genes soto speak — will be expensive.
Authenticity— You might be able to grab a keysoftware application for free, but even if you don’t need a manual, youmight like to be sure it is bug free, reliable, and warranted. You’llpay for authenticity. There are nearly an infinite number of variationsof the Grateful Dead jams around; buying an authentic version from theband itself will ensure you get the one you wanted. Or that it wasindeed actually performed by the Dead. Artists have dealt with thisproblem for a long time. Graphic reproductions such as photographs andlithographs often come with the artist’s stamp of authenticity — asignature — to raise the price of the copy. Digital watermarks andother signature technology will not work as copy-protection schemes(copies are super-conducting liquids, remember?) but they can serve upthe generative quality of authenticity for those who care.
Accessibility— Ownership often sucks. You have tokeep your things tidy, up-to-date, and in the case of digital material,backed up. And in this mobile world, you have to carry it along withyou. Many people, me included, will be happy to have others tend our""possessions"" by subscribing to them. We’ll pay Acme Digital Warehouseto serve us any musical tune in the world, when and where we want it,as well as any movie, photo (ours or other photographers). Ditto forbooks and blogs.  Acme backs everything up, pays the creators, anddelivers us our desires. We can sip it from our phones, PDAs, laptops,big screens from where-ever. The fact that most of this material willbe available free, if we want to tend it, back it up, keep adding toit, and organize it, will be less and less appealing as time goes on.
Embodiment— At its core the digital copy is withouta body. You can take a free copy of a work and throw it on a screen.But perhaps you’d like to see it in hi-res on a huge screen? Maybe in3D? PDFs are fine, but sometimes it is delicious to have the same wordsprinted on bright white cottony paper, bound in leather. Feels so good.What about dwelling in your favorite (free) game with 35 others in thesame room? There is no end to greater embodiment. Sure, the hi-res oftoday — which may draw ticket holders to a big theater — may migrateto your home theater tomorrow, but there will always be new insanelygreat display technology that consumers won’t have. Laser projection,holographic display, the holodeck itself! And nothing gets embodied asmuch as music in a live performance, with real bodies. The music isfree; the bodily performance expensive. This formula is quicklybecoming a common one for not only musicians, but even authors. Thebook is free; the bodily talk is expensive.
Patronage— It is my belief that audiences WANT topay creators. Fans like to reward artists, musicians, authors and thelike with the tokens of their appreciation, because it allows them toconnect. But they will only pay if it is very easy to do, a reasonableamount, and they feel certain the money will directly benefit thecreators. Radiohead’s recent high-profile experiment in letting fanspay them whatever they wished for a free copy is an excellentillustration of the power of patronage. The elusive, intangibleconnection that flows between appreciative fans and the artist is worthsomething. In Radiohead’s case it was about $5 per download. There aremany other examples of the audience paying simply because it feelsgood.
Findability— Where as the previous generativequalities reside within creative digital works, findability is an assetthat occurs at a higher level in the aggregate of many works. A zeroprice does not help direct attention to a work, and in fact maysometimes hinder it. But no matter what its price, a work has no valueunless it is seen; unfound masterpieces are worthless. When there aremillions of books, millions of songs, millions of films, millions ofapplications, millions of everything requesting our attention — andmost of it free — being found is valuable.
The giant aggregators such as Amazon and Netflix make their living inpart by helping the audience find works they love. They bring out thegood news of the ""long tail"" phenomenon, which we all know, connectsniche audiences with niche productions. But sadly, the long tail isonly good news for the giant aggregators, and larger mid-levelaggregators such as publishers, studios, and labels. The ""long tail"" isonly lukewarm news to creators themselves. But since findability canreally only happen at the systems level, creators need aggregators.This is why publishers, studios, and labels (PSL)will never disappear.They are not needed for distribution of the copies (the internetmachine does that). Rather the PSL are needed for the distribution ofthe users’ attention back to the works. From an ocean of possibilitiesthe PSL find, nurture and refine the work of creators that they believefans will connect with. Other intermediates such as critics andreviewers also channel attention. Fans rely on this multi-levelapparatus of findability to discover the works of worth out of thezillions produced. There is money to be made (indirectly for thecreatives) by finding talent. For many years the paper publication TVGuide made more money than all of the 3 major TV networks it ""guided""combined. The magazine guided and pointed viewers to the good stuff onthe tube that week. Stuff, it is worth noting, that was free to theviewers.  There is little doubt that besides the mega-aggregators, inthe world of the free many PDLs will make money selling findability —in addition to the other generative qualities.",,"Value, Generative, Immediacy"
When poets get angry,"By now,Poetree.coophas probably been shut down.
While it lasted, it was the best-designed, richest source of p2p poetry sharing available online. Only a typical lunk-headed heavy-handed ploy by the inner circle of poets was able to shut it down.
All the classics were there: Rod McKuen, Roald Dahl, even the Dr. (Seuss) himself. In addition, you could find the complete poetry of Percy Bysshe Shelley, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and even Thomas Moore.
So, amidst all of these gems, what happened? Why the controversy?
Alisha Grant, spokesperson for the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation, had this to say, ""We applaud the work of the FBI in shutting down this travesty of copyright. If we want great poetry, America, we’re going to have to pay for it.""
Many of the world’s top poets reported dramatic decreases in royalties and sales as a result of the site. ""When poetry is free, no one is willing to pay for it,"" one poet is quoted byWired.Even though some poets had reportedly been earning three or four million dollars a year in royalties and advances, it apparently wasn’t enough.
Missing in the blizzard of press releases was any compassion for the unemployed poetry lover, or for the student who might need to get a few stanzas of an important elegy or even a limerick.
Consider this haiku, for example. Without the net, you wouldn’t be able to discover it without buying an entire book of bad poetry:
Rebels have to haverules often to feel that there’sa cause for their acts

Where do we begin?,"Every time I write a post, I have a dilemma.
Am I writing foryou,the one who has read more than 2,000 of myprevious postsover the last five years? The one who has bought (and read!) so many of mybooksand is all caught up on myhistory?
It matters, of course, because I can take shortcuts, it changes the perception of my tone of voice and I can skip a lot of the preliminaries.
Or am I writing foryou,the first-timer, the person who found this post on Digg orDelicious?If it’s you, then I should take my time, write a bit more, put some background links in, etc.
Now, of course, you have the same dilemma too.
You have it when someone friends you on Facebook. Maybe they found you cause you’re cute, or because you just joined a new company or because you’re a friend of Tom’s. Or maybe they’veknownyou since summer camp and you just need to reconnect…
I think this dichotomy of experience raises the level of responsibility for the reader. Without knowing who you’re reading, it’s hard to judge the tone of voice of what you’re hearing. More important, it changes the posture of the writer.

Getting vs. Taking,"Most people spend a lot of time to get an education.
They wait for the teacher (hopefully a great one) to give them something of value.
Many employees do the same thing at work. They wait for a boss (hopefully a great one) to give them responsibility or authority or experiences that add up to a career.
A few people, not many, but a few, take. They take the best education they can get, pushing teachers for more, finding things to do, exploring non-defined niches. They take more courses than the minimum, they invent new projects and they show up with questions.
A few people, not many, take opportunities at work. Marketers have the easiest time of this (sort of hard to commandeer the chain saw) but don’t do it nearly as often as they should.

Where to find great ideas and arresting images (for free),"If you need photos for a presentation or website or brochure, try Flickr.

Another tip: when you are trying to brainstorm, Flickr is a great place to find connections between ideas that hadn’t occurred to you. Even if you don’t use the picture, theideasare priceless. Do a search on lobster or clouds or crowds or quality and see what comes up.

A dumb branding strategy,"Jewelry Central is a really bad brand name. So are Party Land, Computer World, Modem Village, House of Socks and Toupee Town.
It’s a bad brand name because Central or Land or World are meaningless. They add absolutely no value to your story, they mean nothing and they are interchangeable. ""Here honey, I bought you these cheap earrings at Diamond World!"" Not only are they bland, but you can’t even remember one over the other. This is the absolute last refuge of a marketer who has absolutely nothing to say and can’t even find the guts to stand for what they do. It’s just generic.
The second reason this is an exceedingly dangerous strategy is that if you start to succeed a little bit, you suddenly want to protect your lame name. So you hire a lawyer and start to harass people for using the English language. So Computer Land sued Business Land (or maybe it was the other way around) and lost. Or consider the angry lawyer at Jewelry Village (or was it Central, I can’t remember) who sent a letter to Squidoo complaining about an editorial (not a retail) page that used the phrase. There are more than 15,000 matches for this phrase in Google, which means he’s got a lot of letters to send, and a lot of people to annoy. For what? Even if he manages to make a lot of noise, he’s just reminding the world how generic the phrase is in the first place. Can you name one successful brand (except Pizza Hut and I think they succeeded despite the name) that managed to pull this off? [Yes, there’s Central Market and IHOP and Radio Shack… thanks for the submissions. I’m going to argue that in each case, the name slowed down something else that was truly powerful…]

The dark side,"Snapnames informs me that the most competitive domain name up for auction this week is breastenlargementhypnosis.com.
Think about that one for a bit.
So much effort is going to be spent building this business. Money and time invested in design and promotion and, possibly, hypnosis. Why? To trick people.
I’m amazed every single day at the lengths some people will go to in order to run scams online. It’s so much more work to create a spam site or a deceptive come on, so much more work to deal with the angry customers and be hiding from them…
I can imagine it becomes a habit. Once you start cutting corners and playing a selfish game to see how far you can bend (or break) the rules, it must be hard to stop. It’s all relative, and what they’re doing must seem relatively benign compared to someone else. Of course, there’s always someone more crooked, always someone more selfish…

Managing urgencies,"Do you have a plan?
A long or medium term plan for your brand or your blog or your career or your project?
You can have grand visions for remodeling your house or getting in shape, but if there’s a fire in the kitchen, you drop everything and put it out. What choice do you have? The problem, of course, is that most organizations are on fire, most of the time.
I gave a talk the other day, all about the unstoppable slow decline of interruption (traditional) media and the opportunities for rethinking how we communicate with people. At the end of the talk, someone came up and had very nice things to say about what he’d learned. Then he leaned over and asked me to help him brainstorm about his brand’s upcoming ad campaign, because it was due to his boss on Friday.
Add up enough urgencies and you don’t get a fire, you get a career. A career putting out fires never leads to the goal you had in mind all along.
I guess the trick is to make the long term items even more urgent than today’s emergencies. Break them into steps and give them deadlines. Measure your people on what they did today in support of where you need to be next month.

The bad table,"I saw a marketing dilemma at the hot new restaurant I went to the other night.
We got there on time at 6:30 and the restaurant was about a third full. We were promptly seated at the worst table in the place, in the back, in the corner, cramped by the kitchen.
We were first-time patrons, having secured a reservation via Open Table. That made us doubly second-class citizens, I guess.
We asked for a better table, pointing to one a few feet away. ""Oh, I’m sorry, that one is reserved.""
The chances, of course, that a particular table is reserved are close to zero. What he meant was, ""oh, we have a regular customer who deserves that table more than you.""
Hence the marketing dilemma:who should get your best effort?Should it be the new customer who you just might be able to convert into a long-term customer? Or should it be the loyal customer who is already valuable?
Sorry, but the answer is this:you can’t have a bad table.
No one wants to settle for the bad table, your worst salesperson, your second-rate items. Not the new customers and not the loyal ones…
Which means you need to figure out how to improve your lesser offerings. Maybe the table in the worst location comes with a special menu or a special wine list or even a visit from the chef. Maybe the worst table, for some people, becomes the best table because of the way you treat people when they sit there…

The world’s worst toaster,"We recently acquired what might be the worst toaster in the history of the world. It’s pretty fancy and shiny and microprocessor controlled. And it makes toast.
But here’s what I have to do to use it:
Most toasters, of course, consist of steps 3 and 4 only.
I thought about this when I got a note from eBay asking me to pay my bill for an item I sold last month. It says:
To view your invoice and make a payment:1. Go to http://www.ebay.com and click ""My eBay"" at the top of most eBay pages. You will need to sign in.2. Click the ""Seller Account"" link (beneath ""My Account"" on the left side of the page).3. Click the ""View invoices"" link, and then select the invoice you want to view from the pull-down menu.4. To make a payment, click the ""make a one-time payment"" link in the ""eBay Seller Fees"" section.
It took me more than 11 clicks to send them $6.

What you can learn from Arthur C. Clarke,"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

He really was a genius.

Why bother having a resume?,"This is controversial, but here goes:I think if you’re remarkable, amazing or just plain spectacular, you probably shouldn’t have a resume at all.
Great people shouldn’t have a resume.
Here’s why: A resume is an excuse to reject you. Once you send me your resume, I can say, “oh, they’re missing this or they’re missing that,” and boom, you’re out.
Having a resume begs for you to go into that big machine that looks for relevant keywords, and begs for you to get a job as a cog in a giant machine. Just more fodder for the corporate behemoth. That might be fine for average folks looking for an average job, but is that what you deserve?
If you don’t have a resume, what do you have?
How about three extraordinary letters of recommendation from people the employer knows or respects?Or a sophisticated project they can see or touch?Or a reputation that precedes you?Or a blog that is so compelling and insightful that they have no choice but to follow up?
Some say, “well, that’s fine, but I don’t have those.”
Yeah, that’s my point. If you don’t have those, why do you think you are  remarkable, amazing or just plain spectacular? It sounds to me like if you don’t have those, you’ve been brainwashed into acting like you’re sort of ordinary.

How many record execs does it take to screw in a lightbulb?,"From Dan Kennedy’svery funny new book:First of all, before we change anything, is the light bulb reallyburned out? Maybe we just need to breathe some life into it; repackageit, maybe the light bulb could do a duet with somebody (Sheryl Crow?Tim McGraw?) in hopes of getting some crossover appeal, maybe it couldbe in a beer commercial, maybe we could get it out on the road with abrighter light bulb. The other thing to think about is that thissummer, Honda is rolling out a 100 Million dollar campaign for a newcar aimed at thirty-somethings who consider themselvesadventurous/spontaneous but can’t really afford something like a luxuryS.U.V. and it might be a perfect campaign to tie this light bulb into,at least it would be the perfect demographic, in terms of age.
Also, and this is just an idea: what if we found out what videogames are being released in the third quarter and maybe pitched theidea of having our light bulb make an appearance in the video game atsome certain level of completion; like, you get to a dark cave, let’ssay, if it’s an adventure game, and if you have enough points you canget the light bulb – and it would be our light bulb, obviously – andthen it’s easier to see in the cave. The other thing is this:worst-case scenario the light bulb is, in fact, burned out. Is thatreally the end of the world? I mean, maybe that’s actually of morevalue to us in the long run: Picture this for voice over: ""The lightbulb is dead. . . but the legend lives on. . . re-released,re-mastered, revealed. . . the light bulb. . . IN STORES NOW."" Italmost makes more sense than taking the time changing it, plus, if it’sdead we can sell it without dealing with it, you know what I mean? Nodemands from it, no hotels, no road expense, no delays in the projectfrom its end, etc. But, like I said, I’m just thinking off the top ofmy head here, just brainstorming, and none of this is written in stone.But the first thing we should do is figure out how we want to handlethis, because the light bulb’s manager is a total nightmare and we’regoing to have to take a meeting and listen to him sooner or later, andwe should know what our plan is before we sit down with him. And let metell you right now that the first thing out of his mouth is going tobe, ""This light bulb should be the brightest light bulb in the world,and it could be the brightest light bulb in the world, but you need tosupport the light bulb, you need to give the light bulb TV ads, youneed to be more active in giving the light bulb tour support, we needto have some promotion from your end!"" and on and on. And in thatmeeting, if you’re in it, the only answer from our side should be thatwe’re obviously very excited to be working with the light bulb, that wedon’t think it needs to be changed, that the only problem is peoplehaven’t seen how bright the light bulb could be, and our plan is to doeverything we can to make this light bulb happen.
I’ll send out an email to everyone before the meeting to remindpeople of our position on this, but the bottom line is we don’t havethe budgets right now, and basically we need to see something happeningwith the light bulb before we go throwing good money after bad, butobviously we can’t have the light bulb’s manager hearing that. I cantell you all that I’m personally very excited to be working with thelight bulb, I think it will light up very brightly, and we’re not goingto stop working the light bulb, in whatever ways budgets will permit,until it does, in fact, light up very brightly. . . the light bulb is avery big priority for us from the top of the company to the bottom.Period.

Forum posts have not been successful at troubleshooting this. I have no doubt that this blog post will find the person insightful, smart and kind enough to tell me what to do.
Which leads to the point of the post: what if you don’t have a popular blog?
How do you find that one person in the wide wide world that has the answer to your question, whatever your question might be?
Google is amazing partly because it goes so far in helping with the haystack problem. Want a part for your 1957 drill press? You can find it on Google.
But Google doesn’t help with finding experts when the problem is hard to define, or when interactivity is required. And just about any solution you can dream up has a friction problem: once the system is in place, it will get used too much, by too many questioners, and suddenly it won’t be interesting enough for the masses to listen. For example, Craigslist suffers from a decreasing signal to noise ratio (it’s a lot less fun to browse than it used to be).
Let’s say, for example, I was an executive recruiter. Surely, I would benefit from interrupting every person on the planet to advertise a great new job. But I couldn’t do it every day or every hour…

“Do you have” vs. “Do you want”,"John Moore talks aboutBorders Reducing its Borders.
It turns out that cutting inventory by 10% and facing books out (instead of just showing spines) increased their sales by 9%. This is counter to Long Tail thinking, which says that more choices and more inventory tend to increase sales.
The distinction is worth noting, because there are two valid strategies.
You can stock everything, so that the answer to the question, ""do you have"" is yes.
Or, you can market and sell, not just take orders, so instead of answering that question, you’re asking, ""do you want?""
Do you want this cool new cookbook about Spain? It’s right next to that amazing new novel about food in Spain…
Bookstores that follow this strategy need to be pickier about what they carry, organized differently (alphabetical order again!) and staffed differently as well.

Alphabetical order is obsolete,"I love the alphabet and the fact that it has an order. There’s no reason for the order of the letters, but there you go.
With computers, though, alphabetical order is almost always a bad idea, even chronological order doesn’t work perfectly.
Example: When I look through my spam folder, I shouldn’t see the notes in chrono order or alphabetical by sender (with AAAA’ going first…). No, I should see the notes in order of least likely to be spam to most likely. Right? (book tip:Everything is Miscellaneous).
Example: When I do a search in Google images, I want them sorted by relevance and then, within that, by size. Bigger is better.
Bookstores really don’t have much choice. They need to alphabetize the books so you’ll know that you’ll find me in the Gs, near Malcolm Gladwell. But Amazon has no business using the alphabet, because almost any other ordering technique makes more sense.
Going to alpha by default is lazy and ineffective and expensive.
Why does my Sonos make me start browsing my music collection with Abba? (Phew, I don’t have any Abba, but you get the idea). Wouldn’t it make more sense to show me, ""music you haven’t heard lately that’s similar to music you’ve been listening to"" first?
Your address book is in alphabetical order, right? Why? If you want to look someone up, type the name in. Alpha is least useful way to browse 4,000 names in an address book. I want them sorted by recency of contact, or in tickler-file order.
If I knew that lists of blogs in blog readers would be in alpha, I would have changed my name.
Your data files, your product catalog… none of it should be in alphabetical order.

The thing about ‘free’,"I posted aninternshipyesterday. The idea was to combine the ""you pay to come"" model of summer camp with the ""we pay you to do low level work"" of an internship to create a learning experience for students that was, split the difference, free. I felt like a free program would represent a combination of our effort and the interns.
Free, though, is not the average of paid and paid for. Free is something entirely different.
My friend Joel dropped me a note and asked why I was asking people to post a deposit (to be returned at the end of the summer). It felt wrong to him. I wrote back,
When I do a non profit seminar (they’re always free), the number of people who say, ""yes I’m coming"" and the number of people who come is not the same.
So, if I have room for ten, do I do a seminar for eight, or do I book 12 seats and play airline seat manager for the day?
I have no doubt, none, that if it were free, at least one person wouldn’t show.
That got me thinking about free music, free samples and other free interactions. They’re different. Paying a dollar for a song isn’t expensive to anyone who pays $3 for a cup of coffee. The dollar isn’t about expense, it’s about selection and choice and commitment.
There is no commitment, one way or the other, for free. If applying to college were free, the number of schools people would apply to would approach infinity–yet the cost of the application is trivial compared to the cost of tuition.
At the TED conference, which costs plenty of money, they had baskets of cool free snacks. Expensive little bags of nuts and stuff, all free. And what you noticed was lots of half-eaten bags of stuff. If the snacks had cost just a quarter, consumption would have been lower and my guess is that satisfaction would have been higher.
The interaction you seek as a marketer often disappears when something is free. The fascinating thing is that it often doesn’t matter if you’re paying or being paid… it’s the transaction either way that changes the posture of the person you’re working with.
So, if I want to be taken seriously, I could charge for the internship or I could pay. We’re going to pay.
As you think about your web service or your newsletter or the sales calls you go on, consider this: could you charge for it? What would happen if you paid for it? Time share folks have been paying people to endure a sales call for years. My guess is that this is because it works. And trade shows charge people to attend what is essentially a large loud sales call show floor. (Important note: ‘charging’ doesn’t always mean cash money. Giving you large amounts of attention or privacy or data counts too).
When you bring money into the equation, everything changes (ask the governor of New York). Chris Anderson is right when he writes about the power of free in marketing… it dramatically increases sampling and earns you the right to attention, at least for a while. I think Google is the exception that proves the rule: the most powerful brands are the ones that earn the right to a transaction.","March 11, 2008","free, commitment, value"

That noise inside my head,"I think in every case the answer is the same: Internal noise.[I got a few notes about check cashing services, by the way. In many cities, there arebanksthat have sensible policies for low income customers, and most jobs that use a payroll service like ADP offer direct deposit. The combination would save a large number of people a lot of time and money, and my point isn’t that there are enough financial services available to the less fortunate (there aren’t) but that if it weren’t for a fear of banks, plenty more people would take advantage of the services that are available. $5 a week for check cashing might account for 30% of someone’s disposal income, which is a sin.]
My friend Lisa was on a plane once and her seatmate kept looking at her. She finally said, ""Is the noise inside my head bothering you?""
Just about everyone has noise inside their head. It’s a noise that keeps them from being rational, that forces them to avoid the simple truths sometimes, that makes them unable to take a shortcut when a long (more emotional one) is available.Emotional intelligence(EQ) gives us a way to talk about how people navigate the world. Far more important than IQ in most settings, emotional intelligence can be learned, but it rarely is. My take is that not only is it important for dealing with work and personal situations, it also makes you a better consumer of marketing.
If you as a marketer(/fundraiser/teacher/blogger/salesperson/parent) are assuming that all the citizens in your audience have genius level EQ, you’re almost certainly making a mistake and you’re paying for it every day.",,"Internal noise, emotional intelligence, financial services"
"Sunk costs, quitting and the value of your brand","One of the most important lessons they teach in business school is to ‘ignore sunk costs’. It doesn’t matter how much time or money or effort you’ve invested in something, if that project no longer makes economic sense, you should stop.
And inThe Dip, I talk about the powerful benefits of quitting.
Which leads to an interesting marketing question that doesn’t have a lot to do with your political views and a lot to do with your take on sunk costs and brand quality: Should Hillary Clinton quit?
Certainly, there are a lot of sunk costs. Years of effort, dues paid, heartaches endured. This might be her best window of opportunity, after all. And yet, all of these sunk costs should be completely irrelevant to the decision. For every brand and for every person, yesterday is irretrievably gone and tomorrow is worth a great deal.
Last week, my company switched providers of an expensive commodity. The company we had been with realized we were moving on and moved into high gear to keep the account. At one point, it was clear that they could have gone into war room-mode, denigrating our decision, criticizing the new company and scorching the earth. I watched the gears turn, though, and saw them take a different path.
Here’s the math as I see it for brand Hillary: The only chance she has to win is to burn down other brands, violate protocol, push harder than many think appropriate.She has to change her brand to achieve her goal.Not only that, but she has to risk the entire Party at the same time. If she does manage to win the nomination, she will bepilloriedby the right (the very same Rush thatendorsedher in Texas). They’re just waiting for the chance.
The new brand, the one that it would take to succeed at this stage, almost guarantees she doesn’t succeed at the next.
And the alternative?
The alternative is to quit. To become a statesman. A respected power broker.
The alternative is to be the trusted advisor, the person who gave up one dream to realize a bigger one, and to build a brand and a lifestyle with long-term leverage.
That company we switched from last week? Instead of ruining our relationship and criticizing our judgment, they kept the door open. They congratulated us on our growth and earned the right to work with us again one day.
For a long time, we’ve created a myth in our culture that it’s worth any price to reach your goal, especially if your ego tells you that you’re the best solution. We’ve created legends of people and organizations that pursued transformative long shots to achieve great results.
I need to be really clear: pushing through the Dip and becoming the best in the world at what you do is in fact the key to success. But (and it’s a big but), if you’re required to become someone you’re not, or required to mutate your brand into one that’s ultimately a failure in order to do so, you’re way better off quitting instead.","March 9, 2008","Sunk costs, quitting, brand strategy"

The long slide to gone,"I drove past a hobby shop yesterday. It’s hard to make out the awning, but it says, ""Hobbies, Trains, R/C Models, Coffee, Lottery.""
Bit by bit, on each declining day, it became easier to become more average, to add one more item, to sell a few more lottery tickets or another cup of coffee.
And then, the next thing you know, there’s some dusty trains in the back and you’re running a convenience store.
This place, just about every place, has a shot at greatness, at becoming a destination, a place with profits and happiness and growth. Along the way, it’s easy to start compromising your marketing, because it seems like in that moment, it’s expedient.
When this starts happening, the answer is not to do it more. Instead, it’s worth a full stop. Is this what you set out to do? Is compromising everything going to get you to a place that was worth the journey? Wouldn’t it be smarter to just stop selling trains and do something else (lottery tickets, even) but do it really really well.

Chaos Theory,"Shortly after I posted about what you do vs. what you say, Scott sent me this collection ofvideosshot in high school classrooms.
I’m amazed and saddened by this. These teachers have a serious marketing problem and mostly, these kids are actively sabotaging their education… something many in the world would give up almost anything for. The teachers are busy saying, not doing, and the kids are caught in a terrible loop of disrespect.
The blog asks if cell phone cameras are somehow at fault here. I think there’s a significantly bigger question: what are great teachers and great parents doing to market education that’s clearly not happening in these classrooms? (Skipping over the more important question about what is happening at home that led to this in the first place).
Education is largely handmade, not mass produced. That makes it difficult to share best practices and to figure out how to turn mediocre classrooms into great ones. Maybe, just maybe, video of thebest teachingwill do as much to encourage some teachers as the cell phone video does to discourage the rest of us.","March 6, 2008","Education, Teachers, Engagement"

The forces of mediocrity,"Maybe it should be, ""the forces for mediocrity""…
There’s a myth that all you need to do is outline your vision and prove it’s right—then, quite suddenly, people will line up and support you.
In fact, the opposite is true. Remarkable visions and genuine insight are always met with resistance. And when you start to make progress, your efforts are met with even more resistance. Products, services, career paths… whatever it is, the forces for mediocrity will align to stop you, forgiving no errors and never backing down until it’s over.
If it were any other way, it would be easy. And if it were any other way, everyone would do it and your work would ultimately be devalued.

Can I persuade you over time, drip, drip, drip, or do you respond better if you feel an avalanche is coming?
Will you change your mind if I’m funny? Or if I scare you to pieces?
Perhaps there’s no way you’ll be persuaded. Perhaps nothing I can say will make a difference. However, you’ve told yourself that before and been wrong…

The Boss,"This will probably be my last music post for a while, but this note from Randy really makes the point:
""I saw it in action last night at a Bruce Springsteen concert.
Labels have trouble getting someone to pay 9.99 for a CD – yet someone – who travelled from NYC to Montreal to see his 100th + Bruce show – offered my friend $200 on the spot for a set list – a piece of paper made in MS Word that listed what songs Bruce intended on playing. Since it was from the ""inside"" – he just HAD to have it – and when my friend refused to sell – he was given a hug and a kiss on a cheek from this complete stranger for not giving it up – an unspoken understanding that possession of that set list – at that moment – in the afterglow of the show – was priceless.
On top of that, every second license plate leaving the parking lot was from somewhere else – Vermont, Pennsylvania – even I drove in from Ottawa to see the show.
At some point in the last 35 years, Bruce won over each one of those fans – one at a time – and began a relationship. One he respects highly. And every so often he throws a party and we’re all invited to come over for a few drinks to celebrate that relationship – and for that, we’ll gladly chip in about 2 or 3 hundred to help cover the cost.
I am a member of the Bruce tribe – and proud to be.
No one ""likes"" Bruce – they either love him or hate him. He’s committed to what he does – and in turn – fans commit to him.
…
So I guess it comes down to commitment for me.
His first two albums we’re commercial failures – he didn’t walk away- and people stood by him – and for that he gave us Born to Run.
Almost every legacy artist we’ve ever loved has taken multiple albums to find their niche and grow. The Beatles were a 7 year over night success by the time they hit the US.
What was it you said? ""the products and services that succeed wildly are the ones that everyone expected would fail…""
The industry needs to remember that.""","March 3, 2008","Bruce Springsteen, commitment, fan relationship"
The live music talk,"As promised, I’ve put together aPDF transcriptof the talk I did about the music industry. (click to get the PDF).

[Cory asked for it in plain text. Here you go]:
On the future of the music business
…I keep writing books, and writing books about this industry and the industry has never invited me over, so thank you.
So, I’m going to start by pointing out that for the period I’m talking about, which is my entire youth, not ill-spent enough, but my entire youth, the record business was perfect. It was a perfect industry. And I want to tell you why. Each one of these factors is important.
Number one: An entire medium and entire section of the spectrum devoted to promoting the stuff you make…thats great right…for free! An entire thing built around helping you sell more stuff.
Number two: An oligopoly. For those who didn’t grab an MBA [an oligopoly] is where there is a small number of people competing against each other. If you are a band hoping to break out in 1974, 1984, 1993, you didn’t have a lot of choices, and since you didn’t have a lot of choices guess who had a lot of power, a few companies.  And, those companies could demand certain things that they needed from the world.
The third thing that made it perfect is it was a key part of out lives. Look up senior prom on the internet and all you’ll see are stupid pictures, ugly dresses, and people remembering the songs they were listening to. It was the soundtrack for generation after generation. The people in the shoe business don’t have this advantage. The people at almost every business aren’t featured on the prom pages, you guys are.
The next thing, entire chains of retailers devoted to selling your product. In malls they’re paying the rent, not you, Sure they’re extracting shelf space allowances from you, but isn’t that really cool? Whole stores you don’t even have to own, devoted to promoting what you sell.
Next thing, you have God on your side. (slide of “Clapton is god”) Where was the last time you saw a piece of graffiti that said Starbucks is God. This is really good times.
The next thing, one of my favorites, this piece of technology is so cool, it is really cheap to make. You can sell it for a fair amount of money. You can’t copy it, you wear it out and then you need another one. Its pretty, other people can see you own it, and they want one too. And once I don’t have it anymore and give it to you, I don’t have it anymore. This was a really cool thing, bad idea to get rid of this. (audience clapping)
Alright, I’m on a roll here. The next thing, a magazine, not one magazine, several magazine devoted to promoting the product you sell. Again, no magazines about coffee, plenty of magazines about music. And, a whole cable TV channel about it. Lets see if I understand this. Everyone else has to buy TV commercials, you guys get your own channel…and you’re allowed to put scantily clad women on it. (laughter) This is amazing. I’m almost done-almost done with all the good news.
It used to cost a wicked lot of money to make a record. (laughter) Thats good for you because that means the artists need you. Because you’re the ones who pay all the money it costs to make a record.
And the last amazing piece of news is this guy. The voice of Scooby Doo (slide of Casey Kasem). Because, if you made it to the top 40, you made it! There is really something special about best seller lists. Something magic happens when you make the best seller list. What happens is people buy your stuff because other people are buying it. Think about that. You’re popular because you’re popular. And it’s an ever going cycle. And that is underlying a lot of what is going on. So! We can look at this and say, “this was good”, and I’ll grant you, it was good. But that doesn’t mean it’s going to last forever. Just because all of those things lined up to make this the greatest business in history, thats legal, doesn’t mean that you should assume it’s all gonna stay. So, rather than me going through each one of those and bumming you out I’m just going to pick a couple of them and remind you of how the dynamic changed.
Obviously, it’s really hard to make money doing that. Also, remember those guys who bought Beach Boys records? This is what they look like now. (slide of aging couple) (laughter) Now this is really important to understand because when the typical person is a teenager, they’re spending a lot of time looking for more. “What’s the new thing, what’s the next thing, what’s the new thing?” But these guys don’t want that. They want to remember THEN, they don’t go looking for the new thing. And, it’s not your fault they were baby boomers, it’s not your fault the baby boomers are getting old. It’s just true.
The next thing we talked about, this technology wasn’t as good as we hoped when we started. And it’s had a lot of side effects, the biggest one of course being it’s digital. And once you make it digital, all of a sudden the math changes. Because, it used to be if I gave you my record, I didn’t have my record anymore. And now, it’s if I give you my record, I still have my record. And that’s different. I’m not saying it’s better, I’m not saying it’s worse. I’m not saying it’s moral, or immoral, I’m just saying it’s different and we got to accept that. And, one of the side effects of that is that something has fundamentally shifted here. Now, I’m going to give you a little bit of a preview which is, I think the internet is the new radio. And I think we’re needing, in the record business, people in the record business are going to have to think about the fact that, that might be a really good thing, not a really bad thing. And, we’ll come back to that in a minute.
The next idea is this idea that American Top 40, Casey, I don’t even know if he is still alive but its doesn’t matter so much anymore. And the reason it doesn’t matter is because of something called the long tail. I don’t know if you’ve read this book, you should go out and read it right now, you can read it in 45 minutes. And what Chris Anderson [author of The Long Tail] pointed out is this, if I look at Netflix, what I see is that Netflix rentals, half of them are products Blockbuster doesn’t even carry. If I look at Amazon sales, half of Amazon sales are products that are unavailable in any Barnes & Noble store. If I look at the iTunes music store, half of iTunes sales are titles that you could not buy if you went into any record store. What happens when you give people an infinite number of choices in any genre, polka, doesn’t matter, they spread out. And two things occur. One, they go down the tail and start finding what’s just right for them, and two, sales go up. And so what this means is that the very structure of “how do we force as much attention as we can to the top 40” is actually the opposite of what leads to more consumption.
And then the last one, you’ve seen it before, is this idea of suing the very people you’re trying to talk to is unfortunate.
So, what’s next? And where do we go from here? I want to start by saying this really clearly. Music is not in trouble. I believe more people are listening to more music now than any time in the history of the world. Probably five times more than twenty years ago…that much! But, the music business is in trouble. And the reason the music business is in trouble is because remember all those pieces of good news?…every single one of them is not true anymore. Every. One. Now, if you want to, you can curse the fact the Solomon’s couldn’t figure out how to keep the tower going. You can curse the fact that it’s really easy to copy a CD. You can curse the fact that we don’t care about the American top 40. You can curse the fact that there isn’t top 40 radio that matters. What good is that going to do? Or, we could think about the fact that you have more momentum and more assets and more talented people than any body else. [And], at the very same time that people are listening to more music than ever before. Thats really cool. And, so when we think about transitions what we know is that timid trapeze artists are dead trapeze artists. And, that the only way you get from here to there is to just do it. Now, you might be wrong but the alternative is you WILL be wrong. There is no way to go from the perfect music business to the new music business with guaranteed ROI and written assurances-it doesn’t exist. So what will happen, I will guarantee this to you, is that 90% of the people in this industry will timidly start walking their way over and they will all fail. Thats why when you go to look up something online, you don’t go to RandomHouse.com, you go to Google.com. Thats why when you go to buy something on auction online you don’t do to Sothebys.com, you go to Ebay.com. Go down the list, what happened was AOL lost their nerve and didn’t start AOL Book where you could meet friends. They forgot. They were too busy trying to get people to buy a CD and start joining a membership internet service because they weren’t willing to do this. So it’s a little quixotic on my part but I’ve devoted my career to try and get people to do this. So, I think there is a new business here that might even be more perfect than the last one. It’s not the same business, the waves are shaped differently, and you need different skills but someone is going to win big in this business. So, what I want to do, and I’m excited-I’m talking too fast, we don’t have a lot of time here and thats fine with me, is tell you some of the tactics that I would use if I were in your shoes. But I don’t think I’m necessarily right. And if Berry Gordy had called me on the phone in 1964, I would have given him bad advice too. But, I hope what you’ll see in this is the thinking process about some of the realities of what really “is” in the world because you guys are much better than I am at turning those realities into an actual business. So let me try.The first one is that people don’t listen to companies, they listen to people. And what is unique, almost entirely, compared to the movie business, the book business, whatever, is that you sell people. And, there is something magical about the connection between one person and another person. There is something magical about the way we treat celebrities.  And so part of the thing that is out there is that there is a large number of people who want to be led. There is a large number of people who want to connect. There is a large number of people who want to join a tribe. And you have the ability, from where you stand, to make some of those connections happen. What’s really neat is…my friend gets all excited because he needs to score some Bruce Springsteen tickets. Isn’t that interesting, right, because he’s using Greg to get to this tribe of people. That’s really valuable. He doesn’t need to have somebody get a copy of an album, he can just get that, you know, from Amazon for ten bucks, or for free. But the tickets, the connection, the insider, the handshake to one handshake-thats worth a lot! And so far you guys have been treating it like an interesting side effect. But it might be something right at the core of what you do every day.
The next one is my biggest one, and what started me down this whole path which is, if I asked you for the name and address of your 50,000 best customers, could you give it to me? Do you have any clue? Then what happens every day is you guys go to a singles bar and you walk up to the first person you meet and propose marriage and if that person won’t marry you, you walk down the singles bar to every single person until someone says I do. Thats a stupid way to get married. A better way to get married is to go on a date. If it goes well, go on another date. Wait to tell them on the third before you tell them you’re out on parole. (laughter) Then you meet their parents, they me your parents, you get engage, you get married. Permission is the act of delivery. Anticipated, personal, and relevant messages to people who want to get them. I have every record Ricky Lee Jones has ever made including the boot legs that she sells. Rick Lee Jones should know who I am! (laughter) I have bought many of them (pause) well her agents, her people [should know who I am]. I’ve bought many of them directly from her site. I desperately want Ricky Lee to drop me a note telling me when she is going to be in town. I want her to ask me, “should I do a duets album with Willie Nelson, or should I do one with Bruce Springsteen?”. I want to have these interactions. And I want her to say, “I’m making another bootleg, but not until I get 10,000 people to buy it as patrons before I make it”. Because I’d sign up. I’d buy five if it would help, but she doesn’t know who I am. She doesn’t know who I am, she never talks to me. And then every once in a while her record label tries to yell at me, but I’m not listening because they’re yelling at me in a place where I’m not paying attention. And so we look at these phrases, “paying attention”. That’s what you’ve wanted people to do all along. “Pay attention to this artist”. Paying is a weird word isn’t it? You want me to pay you something-my attention. And if you’re wrong, I get nothing back. I had to listen to the Backstreet Boys…AHH! I want those three minutes back. So, it’s a weird relationship.
The next thing is this idea that people care very much about who is sitting next to them at the concert. They care very much about the secret handshake. They care very much about the tribal identification. “Oh you like them, I like them”. The Grateful Dead is an amazingly successful paradigm for many of the things I’m talking about. They didn’t make any money selling records compared to the way they made money doing everything else. Part of it was, you knew if you met someone at a dead concert, they had some things in common with you. The secret handshake, the clothes, whatever it was. And that was important and you were willing to pay money to be with those people. And after Jerry died it was very interesting. Because obviously there was thousands of hours to listen to but that’s not what the people missed. The people missed the place they could go to meet the people like them. At Facebook, it’s all about that. 64 million people who go there every day so they can meet people like them because [Facebook] is very good at dividing people up.
The next thing is what I call the Seinfeld curve. The Seinfeld curve shows us Jerry’s life. If you like Jerry Seinfeld you can watch him on television, for free, in any city in the world two or three times a day. Or, you could pay $200 to go see him in Vegas. But there is no $4 option for Jerry Seinfeld. This is death. You can’t make any money in here. Because if you’re not scarce I’m not going to pay for it because I can get if for free. And one of the realities that the music industry is going to have to accept is this curve now exists for you. That for everybody under eighteen years old, it’s either free or it’s something I really want and I’m willing to pay for it. There is nothing in the center-it’s going away really fast.
The next one is back to this long tail model. The magazine business imploded a long time ago. Saturday Evening Post, Time Magazine, they’re all irrelevant. But you can make a fortune with Playstation magazines, PC gaming [magazines], Game Informer, because there are silos of people who care a great deal. And if you know who those people are, if you have permission to talk to them, ready for this, if you stop looking for listeners for your music, and start looking for music for your listeners instead, the economics of your business totally changes. Magazines make 10x return on equity of books, you know why? Because magazines have subscribers and books don’t. So every time a book comes out they gotta run around looking for someone to buy it. Where as the magazine people just look for the next author to write the next article in the next magazine.
The next idea is this idea of liking. There is a lot of music I like. There is not so much music I love. They didn’t call the show, “I Like Lucy”, they called it “I Love Lucy”. And the reason is you only talk about stuff you love, you only spread stuff you love. You find a band you really love, you’re forcing the CD on other people, “you gotta hear this!”. We gotta stop making music people like. There is an infinite amount of music people like. No one will ever go out of the way to hear, to pay for, music they like.
And the last one is back to this tribal thing. It’s really important to people to feel like they are part of that tribe, to feel that adrenaline. We are willing to pay money, we’re willing to go through huge hoops, trampled to death in Cincinnati if necessary, in order to be in the environment where we feel that’s going on.
So if I put all this together I’m going to come up with what I call the Merchant Solution. It has nothing to do with stores, it has to do with Natalie Merchant. (laughter) So, Natalie Merchant shows up in the New York Times last week saying not only do I not have a record label, I’m not going to make records anymore because I just figure out how to do it. And that is the biggest opportunity times 10,000 because Natalie doesn’t want to be in business, Natalie wants to make records. Thirty years ago Natalie couldn’t put together the scratch to record an album because she couldn’t afford a recording studio. Thats what you guys did for her. She couldn’t come up with the time and energy to go out to California to sell and pay for shelf space at Tower, thats what you guys did for her. The point is, now she needs somebody to say “let us take care of your tribe”. Let us figure out the business model that says you get to do what you’re great at, write songs, perform them, find people who love you, not like you, and they are A LOT in the case of Natalie Merchant, and we will figure out not how to exploit that, not how to write a contract that you’re going to regret for the rest of your life, but to sit next to you and say guess what, there are all these people in the tribe [and] we need to figure out how to make stuff for them. And, because we have three other artists that are just like you, Cowboy Junkies, we can start mixing tribes together in appropriate ways that makes everybody happy. Because you [record label] could go to the Cowboy Junkies tribe and say Natalie Merchant is coming to town and they’ll all go. Because they love her and they love each other and they want to see each other again because they can’t wait a whole year till the [Cowboy] Junkies come back.
So if the model that we loved about the record business in 1968 was A&R, taking care of artists, finding artists who people will love, and the model that we hated was brand management, I want to argue that the next model is tribal management. That the next model is to say, what you do for a living is manage a tribe…many tribes…silos of tribes. That your job is to make the people in that tribe delighted to know each other and trust you to go find music for them. And, in exchange, it could be way out on the long tail, no one wants to be on the long tail by themselves, the polka lovers like the polka lovers, they want to be together. But that you, maybe it is only one person, technology makes this really easy, your job is to curate for that tribe, like the curators upstairs [at the museum]. There is a museum of modern art tribe, you can see them here every Thursday. And if you can curate for them guess what the [musical] artists need…you! Guess what the tribe needs…you! You add an enormous amount of value by becoming a new kind of middleman.
So let me go through, real quick, a bunch of tactics and we can come back to these after I’m done if you want. So, old world, new world. Old world: it mattered who you knew. You know Jan Wenner…thats a good thing. Now it doesn’t matter because there’s an infinite number of outlets-you can have your own channel.
Number two: limited number of physical outlets, now there’s an infinite number of online outlets. An infinite number of places where I can find music.
Number three: an emphasis on hits because you didn’t have a lot of channels, you had to own the ones you had. Now, it’s about niches. I write the number one marketing blog in the world. Who cares. Well not many people here care, but lucky for me that niche has a bunch of people in it who care. And so I enjoy my day writing that blog, I could never write a blog that appealed to everybody. I couldn’t write a Boing Boing blog or a blog about popular culture, but because I get to be the king of this little silo I get benefits out of it.
Number [four]: you yelled at the consumer. You talked directly to the user. Now it’s about two things. One, consumers talking to each other and two, consumers talking to you. How easy is it for a fan to talk to you? Almost impossible because you’re not organized for that and because you didn’t see that there was a benefit. But if you’re in tribal management thats the number one best thing that could happen to you all day is that you get an email or a phone call. Alright? Back to the barrier between the consumer and the permeability.
The next one: your whole life was about interrupting people with messages they didn’t want to get. Fortunately radio made that socially acceptable. Unfortunately the government made it against the law for you to pay for that to occur but you still managed to pull it off. I could get in the car, turn on the radio and hear a song I wasn’t expecting and maybe I would like it. If I didn’t like it, it didn’t cost you anything anyway. Now it’s about permission. Now I get on the radio and in my car I have either my mp3s in there or I have satellite in there, I don’t hear anything i don’t want to hear. So, the model has totally changed.
Next one: you used to have a factory. The factory is the recording studio, you know, the ability to get the number of things on the shelf space at Tower. You built everything around that factory. There’s no factory anymore! If you guys put up one ad on Craigslist you’d have records here tomorrow, done, finished, by email. Because everyone has the ability to make a record now. It used to take a long time. Someone would go to the studio, Boston, and we’d hear from them three or four years later. Now you can put a State of the Union speech out as a hip-hop record one day after he gives his speech and you could sell a bunch on iTunes. It used to be “how big a share of the market can we have?” Now it’s about “how do we touch a tribe, just for a minute?” As long as the tribe is happy, we’re happy. It used to be about what features, checklist stuff, now it’s “is there a story behind this artist, is there a story behind the person?”. Advertising, promotion, shelf space, that used to be what you paid cash money for. Now you’re going to have to figure out how to innovate in the way you interact with people.
And I think this is my last one: stability used to be “we’re big, you can trust us.”. Now small overhead, we own the polka silo, we only need one person to take care of it, gives you the ability to have low risk when taking care of the long tail.
Customer support isn’t as important as consumer support. How do you get people to help each other?
So, if I had to show you one slide again, it would be this one. It would be, “I really want to hear from you”.  Ricky Lee. Please! write to me, I want to be part of the tribe, I want you to talk. It’s not about, anymore, how many people can you reach. Super Bowl, doesn’t matter. it’s irrelevant. The internet is the new radio. What that means is this you’ve been arguing and hassling and yelling and pushing for 40 years to get more air time. Now you have infinite air time. That’s what the internet is for you. The internet is the ability to get any song you want in front of the people who want to hear it with huge reach and no barriers. What matters isn’t how many, it’s who. Who are you reaching, who are the thought leaders, who are the people who are going to tell other people? Who are the people who are out there trying to find the next big thing because those people are going to influence what the next trend is, and if you’re in the middle of that trend, because you’ve used this new medium to spread the ideas, you’re going to start paying for internet airtime soon because it’s worth it. It’s not that you need to say “no, no, no, I can’t let you hear this” it’s “I want you to hear this”. Because if you hear it you might join the tribe, and if you join the tribe then over time I’ll take care of you so well you’ll want to pay me. And then people will be passionate when they hear what you do for a living, they’re going to die to have you help them meet other people in the tribe.","March 2, 2008","music industry, tribal management, digital transformation"

Self promotion,"Owen Wilson starred in a really bad movie that came out a few months ago. Most notable: he didn’t go out to shill for it. No Colbert, no Daily Show, no Larry King.
Perhaps he’s nursing a bad cold, but my guess is that he didn’t want to extend his personal brand to promote a movie just because he was in it.
Here’s an interesting dichotomy:
Watch this because I’m in itvs.I’m in it because you’ll enjoy watching it.
Or,
I published a book so I need you to read itvs.There’s something you need to read, so I wrote about it.
Or
I’m fifty and I just made an album because it was time for me to make one.vs.These songs won’t let go of me and I want to share them with you because they matter.
The first is me-centric and explains that we’re promoting something that got made because we need to sell it. What we do is make stuff and sell it, and what you do is buy it or watch it.  “I needed to make something to sell, here’s the best I could do.”
The second is you-centric. It starts with the needs and desires of the consumer and ignores the committees, the compromises and the economic realities. It says, “I found something for you, here it is.”
Most of the time, most b2b and most consumer products are sold on the basis of: Yes, there are other choices, but this is the onewemake. I’m not sure that’s a good enough reason.
80% of the mail and promotion I get (and 98% of the ads) fall into this category. The enthusiasm of commerce, not of belief and pride.

Signal to noise,"In radio operator lingo, you look for a strong signal to noise ratio. That’s the amount of good stuff (the message) that comes through the static (the noise.) You can use your squelch button to turn down the static, but if there isn’t enough signal, you don’t hear anything at all.
For a decade, the web kept delivering an ever better signal to noise ratio to me. I was able to hear more things, more clearly, in less time. Websites and email and my RSS reader were bringing me signals from everywhere, and processing them (and creating, I hope, new signal) was a joy.
Lately, I’m feeling noise creep.
Lately, the noise seems to be increasing and the signal is fading in comparison. Too much spam, too many posts, too little insight leaking through. I don’t use Twitter, but I know a lot of Twitter users are feeling this. So are folks who go to too many conferences. And don’t get me started on victims of Blackberry cc: disease.

Ouch!,"I just discovered that some of you recently received a piece of spam that began, ""dear first name"". Apparently, it was sent to people who signed up for an audio call I did several months ago.
This is obviously not my idea, and I’m really upset about it.
I have no idea who got the note, and it probably would make things worse to email everyone on the list apologizing, so instead I’m posting about it.
This is simple: Permission Marketing means delivering anticipated, personal and relevant messages to people who WANT to get them. The key word is want. Make it easy for people to sign up, but then give them exactly what you promise.
If you sign up for thing A and the fine print says you get thing B, that’s not permission.
All I can do is apologize. I’ll try to work harder to make sure that people I work with get this through and through. Sorry.
[Here’s a note I just got from my friend who sent the ouch note:
Dear Seth and Seth Godin fans,
Even the biggest Seth fans like me and supporters of Permission Marketing screw up from time to time.  Today, that person is me.  I have egg on my face and give your readers a glaring example of what NOT to do to communicate with a permission-based list and to build relationships with customers and clients
…I accidentally sent an email to some folks who opted in JUST for the Seth teleseminar series earlier this year.  A big mistake…one that I didn’t realize until it was too late.  To make matters worse, I left the standard ""dear firstname"" at the top of the email.  What a brilliant disaster and royal mess.  I did exactly the opposite of what I intended to do – to send a relevant message to a small group who gave me permission to send emails like the one I did.
I can’t undo the damage, but I can apologize and can make sure that you and your readers know that it was not intentional.   I can only hope that you trust my integrity when I say that and trust that it won’t happen again.

Nearly infinite,"Infinite isn’t what it used to be. There used to be an infinite number of stars, and probably an infinite number of kids in high school who didn’t like you very much, but that was about it when it came to a typical human being’s interaction with the uncountable.
But now, infinite is everywhere.
There’s an infinite number of books at Barnes and Noble (you can’t read em all, in fact, you can’t even find enough time to know the name of every one, or even just the first name of every author.)
There’s certainly, for all intents and purposes, an infinite number of web pages. And even Facebook, just a small subset of the web, has an infinite number of friends for you to make.
That’s where search comes in. Search makes the infinite finite (at least for a while). With search, we turn the infinite selection on Amazon into a nearly manageable finite selection. Except search (no matter where you look) is pretty lame, and it doesn’t really turn infinite collections into manageable choices. There are thousands of Godins on Facebook, too many for me to count (though one Godin friended a family member and it appears she’s trying to friend every Godin in the world–even though my name is a three-generation old fiction). There’s a lot of haystacks out there, and the needles are really good at hiding.
There are essentially an infinite number of good causes to contribute to, an infinite number of people to help, an infinite number of great records to listen to as well. The problem is finding them. Connecting. Feeling like you were successful and not missing something you really needed or wanted.
Search on the web is now grappling with this. If you know 100,000 words, names and brand names, there are now a hundred trillion different searches you can do… with only two words in combination.  No, you might not want to search on Starbucks Matzoh, but you could. Just knowing what to search for is now as difficult as the search itself.
In the face of infinity, many of us are panicking and searching less, going shallower, relying on bestseller lists and simple recommendations. The vast majority of Google searches are just one or two words, and obvious ones at that. The long tail gets a lot shorter when you don’t know what’s out there.

Pretending that you care,"I spent part of the day in New York yesterday.
First stop, an expensive sporting goods store that prides itself on service. I bought some skates, paid and then asked the security guy (the one with all the shelves behind his desk, where people check stuff they bring in) if I could leave my stuff there for ten minutes while I ran an errand.
""No, I’m really really sorry,"" he said, ""but we can’t take responsibility and I’ll get in big trouble if I do. I know it’s a hassle for you…""
I left and did my errand. A little later, on my way back to the car, I had one last street to cross. Suddenly, a motorcade of 20 police cars, sirens roaring, whizzed by, blocking the crosswalk and making me miss the light (if anyone knows why NY City cops are suddenly doing this a lot, please let me know. Where are they going? Why? If it’s an emergency, why don’t they go faster? [Ariknows]).
As I waited for the cops to go by, I watched a meter guy walk up to my car and slowly start to write me a parking ticket. I was being penalized for being a good citizen and waiting for the endless motorcade!
I ran up and begged.
He turned to me and said, ""I’m so sorry. I know what a hassle it is, but once I press this yellow button here, I have to finish. But I bet if you go to court and complain, they’ll waive it."" Then he reached into his pocket and handed me a lollipop. ""Thanks for coming to New York, and I’m sorry.""
Except this story isn’t true.
The guy at the sporting goods store just grunted at me. Explained it wasn’t his job and just dared me to return the skates I had just bought. And the meter guy didn’t even bother to acknowledge me or make eye contact.
No, you can’t always hire exceptional people for these jobs. No, you can’t always invest enough time to train them sufficiently. But yes, you can make, ""pretending you care,"" a barely acceptable alternative.
It doesn’t take much to take the edge off an encounter.
[Boy does this sound cynical. How inauthentic! How manipulative! Isn’t it better to just hire people who actually care? Of course it is. But as far as I can tell, that’s a lot harder than it looks–because so many organizations are organized around policies, not caring, and because so many employees have been trainednotto care.
So, the essence of the lesson here is this: if people start out pretending to care, next thing you know, they actuallydocare. They like the positive feedback and they like the way being kind makes them feel. It spreads. It sticks.]",,"customer service, authenticity, empathy"

Silly Traffic,"This is a truth of the Internet: When traffic comes to your site without focused intent, it bounces.
75% of all unfocused visitors leave within three seconds.
Any site, anywhere, anytime. 75% bounce rate within three seconds.
By unfocused, I mean people who visit via Digg or Stumbleupon or even a typical Google search. If your site is spammy or clearly selling something, the number is certainly higher. If you’re getting traffic because you have a clever domain name, it might be even higher. I don’t know of many examples where it is lower.
It’s good for your ego, that’s certain. You can brag about hits if you can get away with it, or pageviews or visits. But the bounce rate is still that scary 75%.
So, what should you do about silly traffic?
The tempting thing to do is to obsess over it. If you could just convert 10% of the bouncers, you’d be increasing your conversion rate by almost a third! (7.5% is about a third of the 25% who don’t bounce). There’s a million things you can do to focus on this, and almost none of them will show you much improvement.
One other thing you can do is get hooked on the traffic, focus on building your top line number. Keep working on sensational controversies or clever images, robust controversies or other link bait that keeps the silly traffic coming back
I think it’s more productive to worry about two other things instead.1. Engage your existing users far more deeply. Increase their participation, their devotion, their interconnection and their value.2. Turn those existing users into ambassadors, charged with the idea of bring you traffic that is focused, traffic with intent.
“I’m just looking,” is no fun for most retailers. Yet they continue to pay high rent for high-traffic locations, and invest time and money in window displays. Very few retailers lament all the traffic that walks by the front door without ever walking in. A long time ago, they realized that the shoppers with focused intent are far more valuable.Smart retailers work hard to get focused people to walk in the door and to keep the riff raff walking on down the sidewalk.
Your website can do the same thing. In fact, you might want to make itmorelikely that bouncers bounce, not less, but only if those changes increase the results you get from the visitors you truly care about.","April 24, 2008","Traffic, Bounce Rate, User Engagement"

You’re right!,"You probably get feedback from customers. Sometimes you even get letters.
Occasionally (unfortunately), it’s negative.
Two weeks ago, I left my car at (an expensive) parking garage in midtown New York. When I got back four hours later, I discovered that they had left the engine running the entire time. That, combined with the $30 fee and the nasty attitude of the attendant led me to write a letter to the management company.
The response: it was my fault. When I dropped off the car, I should have taught the attendant how to turn off my Prius.
What’s the point of a letter like that? Why bother taking the time? It’s not even worth the stamp. Does the writer expect me to say, “Oh, great point! Sorry to have bothered you. I’m an idiot! In fact, I’m so stupid, I’ll go out of my way to park there again next time…”
It’s pretty simple. The only productive response to a critical letter or piece of a feedback from a customer is, “You’re right…”
You’re right, I can see that you are annoyed.You’re right, that is frustrating.You’re right, with the expectations you had, it’s totally understandable to feel the way you do.You’re right, and we’re really sorry that you feel that way.
Every one of these statements is true, each one is something you are willing to put into writing. It validates the writer, thanks them for sharing the frustration and gives you a foundation for an actual dialogue.
But isn’t this pandering? I don’t think so. The writerisright. Theyarefrustrated. His opinion is his opinion, and if you don’t value it, you’re shutting down something useful.
How about, ‘you’re right, it’s reasonable to expect that we would have turned off your Prius. We’ll post a note for all our attendants so they pay better attention in the future.’ A note like this makes the customer happy and it makes your garage work better.
Someone wrote to me last week, complaining that the handwritten inscription in a book I had signed for his colleague wasn’t warm enough. I responded that he was right to be frustrated, and that if his expectations had been so high, I should either have lowered them or exceeded them. Of course he was right… with expectations like that, it’s not surprising that he was disappointed.
Arguing with a customer who takes the time to write to you does two things: it keeps them from ever writing again and it costs you (at least) one customer. Perhaps that’s your goal.

Henry Ford and the source of our fear,"Henry Ford left us much more than cars and the highway system we built for them. He changed the world’s expectations for work. While Ford gets credit for “inventing the assembly line,” his great insight was that he understood the power of productivity.
Ford was a pioneer in highly leveraged, repetitive work, done by relatively untrained workers. A farmer, with little training, could walk into Ford’s factory and become extraordinarily productive in a day or two.
This is the cornerstone of our way of life. The backbone of our economy is not brain surgeons and master violinists. It’s in fairly average people doing fairly average work.
The focus on productivity wouldn’t be relevant to this discussion except for the second thing Ford did. He decided to pay his workers based on productivity, not replacement value.  This was an astonishing breakthrough. When Ford announced the $5 day (more than double the typical salary paid for this level of skill), more than 10,000 people applied for work at Ford the very next day.
Instead of paying people the lowest amount he’d need to find enough competent workers to fill the plant, he paid them more than he needed to because his systems made them so productive. He challenged his workers to be more productive so that they’d get paid more.
It meant that nearly every factory worker at Ford was dramatically overpaid!   When there’s a line out the door of people waiting to take your job, weird things happen to your head. The combination of repetitive factory work plus high pay for standardized performance led to a very obedient factory floor. People were conditioned to do as they were told, and traded autonomy and craftsmanship for high pay and stability.
All of a sudden, we got used to being paid based on our output . We came, over time, to expect to get paid more and more, regardless of how long the line of people eager to take our job was. If productivity went up, profits went up. And the productive workers expected (and got) higher pay, even if there were plenty of replacement workers, eager to work for less.
This is the central conceit of our economy. People in productive industries get paid a lot even though they could likely be replaced by someone else working for less money.
This is why we’re insecure.
Obedience works fine on the well-organized, standardized factory floor. But what happens when we start using our heads, not our hands, when our collars change from blue to white?

George Clooney is not normal,"You can’t hire that guy because he’s not as good looking as George. And you can’t believe that speaker because he doesn’t present as well as George. And that guy?

You can’t date her because she’s not as good looking as Jennifer (whichever Jennifer you want to set as the standard). And her? Well, she stutters, and Jennifer doesn’t. And Jennifer herself, of course, is not nearly as smart as George.
Jennifer and George may be extraordinarily good looking movie stars, but you don’t get to work with them. By buying into a standard of expectation for what’s normal (or great or very good or trustworthy) we shortchange ourselves every single day.

I was talking to someone at the Federal Reserve this week. He explained that in our electronic age, his relationships often start on the phone or by email. And they usually go extremely well, moving things quickly toward a happy conclusion. Sometimes, though, these folks meet him in person… and realize that he doesn’t look a bit like George (he’s black). Understanding that people are judging you—looking for a shortcut in the story they tell themselves—is the first step in telling them a different, better story.
Even better, over time, once it becomes clear that George isn’t so normal after all, we won’t have to worry so much about that story.","April 17, 2008","Expectations, Judgments, Diversity"
The Pope is coming,"Whether you run a hotel or a retail store or a parts supply store, things change when you find out the Pope is coming for a visit.
The fresh flowers get delivered, the beds are made a little tighter and your best staff are waiting out front. Everything is a little bit cleaner and shinier. Maybe, a few staff bring in their kids to sing a song or two.
The thing is, everyone enjoys this extra work. It’s fun to stretch a bit. It doesn’t feel quite as much like work when you’re doing something special.
You probably guessed the punchline: The Pope isn’t coming to your place of business this trip. He won’t be reading your blog or calling your customer service line either. Sorry for the confusion. Go ahead and rent out that room or give away that table you were saving.
But since it’s so much fun, why not do it for someone who isn’t the Pope? Like your next customer?","April 16, 2008","Pope, customer engagement, business preparation"
What’s remarkable?,"This morning at 5:05, I drove away from my house outside of New York City. I flew out of White Plains on USAir… and it worked.
At 7:25 am, I was at the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue. (No, my meeting wasn’t at the White House, it was next door, but still). No hassles, no affronts, no work stoppages, no FAA inspections, no surly overworked attendants, no lost items or near arrests or runway tie ups or traffic jams.

What happens when we organize?,"Most power occurs because one side is better organized than the other. Labor is usually less well organized than management, criminals are usually less well organized than the police and customers are always less well organized than producers.
The internet promises to change that. It does it occasionally, sort of randomly. Sometimes, users will rise up and complain (as they did at Facebook). Or voters will organize online and hurt (or help) a politician or candidate.
Wikipedia works because so many contributors figured out how to self-organize into a group that produced something far more useful than a traditionally organized document.
I think we’re at the earliest possible beginning of the changes we’re going to see because of this sort of grass roots coordination.
Simple example: the Starbucks in Larchmont, NY keeps their thermostat at 64 degrees. And the stores in Breckenridge, Colorado keep their doors wide open all winter. If you’re raging mad about energy waste, you could say something. And nothing would happen. But if customers organized and ten people said something or a hundred people said something… boom, new rules.

The wealthy gardener,"At a seminar at the local library, someone asked, ""how do I make a lot of money blogging?""
My guess is that at last week’s seminar, the one on growing orchids, no one raised his hand and said, ""how do I make a lot of money growing orchids?""
Sure, people make money growing orchids. Some people probably get rich growing orchids. Not many though. And my guess is that the people who do make money gardening probably didn’t set out to do so.
Blogging is much the same way. The best bloggers make money, but mostly as a side effect, not as a direct result of setting out to use a blog to make a profit. It’s just too long a ramp up time, too frustrating and too uncertain to be the best path to make a living.

Catchers and throwers,"Megan has a great post about the difference between catchers and throwers, inspired by my post about twits:SquidBlog: Catchers and throwers.
I had an interesting interaction along these lines this week. A woman named Jennifer Rosini at Forbes sent a note that read:
Hi ,
You are invited to join the new community of the high quality business and financial bloggers from Forbes.com. Our community – the Business and Financial Blog Network, will launch shortly.
I wrote her back, pointing out that she hadn’t even bothered to pretend it was a personal note… just a mail merge missing my name.
She responded (this is the entire note):
I’m not sending these out. I have people working for me that send out 500 a day. Are you interested in joining, Seth?
The juxtaposition of the third sentence with the second just highlighted the inanity of the entire enterprise. It’s a high-quality network, but 500 people a day are being asked to join, and it’s okay to spam people but do I want to join anyway?
The end result of spam (email spam, blog spam, Twitter spam, Squidoo spam, comment spam, phone spam, politician spam) is that it eats away at your brand. If you don’t have a brand, you might make some short term cash but it gets tiresome creating annoyance everywhere you go. If youdohave a brand, a brand like Forbes, say, you don’t notice the brand erosion… until it’s too late.
Here, it’s simple:
You can contact just about anyone you want. The only rule is you need to contact them personally, with respect, and do it months before you need their help! Contact them about them, not about you. Engage. Contribute. Question. Pay attention. Read. Interact.
Then, when you’ve earned the right to attention and respect, months and months later, sure, ask. It takes a lot of time and effort, which is why volume isn’t the answer for you, quality is.
That’s a great way to get a job, promote a site, make a friend, spread the word or just be a human.","April 12, 2008","catchers, throwers, spam"
"Drip, drip, drip goes the Twit","I trust Sarah Fishko.
I don’t know her, I’v’e never bought anything from her and I wouldn’t recognize her if we met, but I trust her.
Every once in a while, over the last few years, Sarah’s voice has come out of my radio, telling me about one interesting cultural event or another. She’s consistent. She shows up. She has built a body of work over time, taking her time, that leads to trust.
Twitter can do that for you.
Not for a million New Yorkers, but perhaps for a hundred or a thousand people you want to reach. Blogs do the same thing.
The best time to look for a job next year is right now. The best time to plan for a sale in three years is right now. The mistake so many marketers make is that they conjoin the urgency of making another sale with the timing to earn the right to make that sale. In other words, you must build trust before you need it. Building trust right when you want to make a sale is just too late.

Zappos wants you to return those shoes,"""We are a service company that happens to sell.""
Zapposwants you to call their 800 number. They want you to order too many shoes. They want you to return (at their expense) the shoes that don’t fit.
As a service company, the more they service you, the better they do. They don’t buy (an enormous number of) ads, they don’t pay rent. Instead, they carry inventory that serves the long tail, they answer their phone and they pay for a lot of fedex shipping.
The more you ask for, the better they do.
Simple, but not so easy.
[Judging from my mail, some readers see this as a blanket endorsement of Zappos. Of course, that’s not my intent (though I do buy shoes from Zappos now and then). My point is that just as Sears used its guarantee 100 years ago to usher in an era of catalog selling, Zappos changed the fundamental business model of a small-time retailer. Instead of real estate, big ads, limited selection and grumpy salespeople, they figured out how to turn the internet to their advantage by reversing every one of those rules. If it can work for shoes, one wonders what it won’t work for… and I think the only reason what they do is unusual is that most entrepreneurs/investors don’t have the discipline and guts to go as close to the edge.]","April 10, 2008","Zappos, customer service, business model"
Drop the dot?,"Rob writes in from Australia, proposing that [dot] com is superfluous, just as www is.
We don’t say, ""Visit us at http://www.askinosie.com,"" we just say, ""askinosie.com.""
It’s pretty clear that we don’t need the front matter. In fact, the latest version of most browsers are intelligent enough that you don’t have to type www in. But do we need the [dot] com part? Shouldn’t the user be smart enough to type in the brand name and expect to get the site?
The suffix is useful, and we’ll have it for a long, long time in my opinion. That’s because [dot] com uses just four characters to say, ""we have a website and this is the address for it."" No need to say  ""our website is"" when you can just use four characters instead.
Toll free numbers developed a similar shorthand. We used to have to explain that an 800 number was free and that you could call it for more info. Now, the area code does all that in 3 digits.
I love the story onboingboingabout how the phone company worked so hard to teach kids how to dial the phone. Everything is new, at least for a while.",,"dot com, website addresses, internet usability"
Who answers the phone?,"The new rules mean that the most valuable marketing event is almost always an inbound phone call.
An inbound phone call is the ultimate in short-term permission. The customer or prospect is taking the time to call you. She’s focused, interested, paying attention and willing to trust you.
Think for a minute about how much you spend (and how high up in the organization the discussions go) when it’s time for a new logo or a new Super Bowl ad.
And yet, even though the rules have changed, the lowest-paid, least-respected, highest-turnover jobs in the organization now do the most important marketing work.
Scharffen-Berger Chocolate (which I’ve featured in some of my books) was bought by Hershey three years ago. They bought it because of me (and people like me). People who will go out of their way to find high quality dark chocolate and then pay a huge premium to buy it.
I’ve been really disappointed with the quality of their product for a few months. It seems to me that in order to ramp up production, they’ve smoothed out some edges and the product is becoming boring. Fewer high notes,  less interesting. So, I called.
The operator, who couldn’t have been nicer, offered me a coupon for a free replacement bar.
A replacement of what? More of the same mediocre product I was calling to complain about?
Of course, she was just doing her job, but who’s fault is that? Who decided to give her nothing but a script, who decided not to take the inbound calls seriously,  who decided that it made sense to put up a wall instead of opening a door? I guess the short version is, ""why isn’t the brand manager answering the phone?""
""Your call is very important to us,""
does not jibe with,
""Due to unusually heavy call volume.""
And the phrase, ""I’m sorry, I’m just doing my job,"" does not match up with the marketing event of a person taking the time to call (or to email).
No, of course Sumner Redstone can’t answer every single letter sent to Viacom. But…
Shouldn’t every single inbound call be answered in one ring? Shouldn’t there be as much spent on self-service customer support as is spent on the design of the selling part of your website? Shouldn’t you be tracking in the finest detail what people have to say when they call in? Shouldn’t you be rewarding call center operators by how long they keep people on the phone, not how many calls they can handle a minute? Shouldn’t there be an easy, fast and happy way for an operator to instantly upgrade a call to management (not a supervisor, I hate supervisors) who can actually learn something from the caller, not just make them go away?
And I guess that’s my biggest point: the goal of every single interaction should be to upgrade the brand’s value in the eye of the caller and to learn something about how to do better,notto get the caller to just go away.","April 9, 2008","Inbound calls, customer experience, brand management"
Why downloading Firefox is like getting into college,"A quick glimpse at just about any profession shows you that the vast majority of people who succeed professionally also went to college.
This could be because college teaches you a lot.
Or it could be because the kind of person that puts the effort into getting into and completing college is also the kind of person who succeeds at other things.
Firefox is similar.
Example: 25% of the visitors we track at Squidoo use Firefox, which is not surprising. But 50% of the people who actually build pages on the site are Firefox users.Twiceas many.
This is true of bloggers, of Twitter users, of Flickr users… everywhere you look, if someone is using Firefox, they’re way more likely to be using other power tools online. The reasoning: In order to use Firefox, you need to be confident enough to download and use a browser that wasn’t the default when you first turned on your computer.
That’s an empowering thing to do. It isolates you as a different kind of web user.
If I ran Firefox, I’d be hard at work promotingextensionsandpowertools (I love the search add-ons) and all manner of online interactions. Think of all the things colleges do to amplify the original choice of their students and to increase their impact as alumni.
And if I ran your site, I’d treat Firefox visitors as a totally different group of people than everyone else. They’re a self-selected group of clickers and sneezers and power users.

In and on and ‘a’,"How to sound smart when talking about the Internet:
You don’t have ‘a facebook.’ Facebook is a place, a network, not a page. You’re ‘on facebook,’ or you ‘use facebook.’
‘Friend’ is a verb. ""I’ll friend you,"" is a totally valid thing to say.
You don’t look up things on‘the google’.It’s just Google, no ‘the.’ ‘Google’ is also a verb, as in, ‘Google me’.
Instant messaging refers to a wide range of software tools and communication channels. It’s called ‘IM’ and it too is a verb.
A blog is something you have (unlike a Facebook). And blog is also a verb. As in, ""I have a blog, this blog, which you probably found by googling me. I blogged about Facebook (which I’m on but don’t use often). I don’t IM, and I’m impossibly lax about friending people.""
[Jackson chimes in that a blog is the whole, and that a post is just one article (like the one you’re reading).

Which comes first (why stories matter),"I was brainstorming with my friend Jay today and he put this picture into my head.
Most of the time we do the work. The work is our initiative and our reactions and our responses and our output. The work is the decisions we make and the people we hire.
The work is what people talk about, because it’s what we experience. In other words, the work tells astory.
But what if you haven’t figured out a story yet?
Then the work is random. Then the story is confused or bland or indifferent and it doesn’t spread.
On the other hand, if you decide what the story is, you can do work that matches the story. Your decisions will match the story. The story will become true because you’re living it.
Does Starbucks tell a different story from McDonald’s? Of course they do. But look how the work they do matches those stories… from the benefits they offer employees to the decisions they make about packaging or locations.
Same is true for that little consulting firm down the street vs. McKinsey. While the advice may end up being similar, each firm lives a story in who they hire, how they present themselves, etc.

The math, however, tells us something different.
(number of people resembling George Clooney)/(jobs for people resembling George Clooney) is a much bigger number than the ratio available to Danny.

Let’s put on a show,"That’s what professional marketers do. They put on a show, on purpose.
There are plenty of naive marketers who are quite (accidentally) successful. My friend Al Yeganeh (""no soup for you!"") didn’t treat customers at his soup stand the way he did as a marketing ploy. It’s just who he was. He was a naive marketer, not a professional one. (Not that there’s anything wrong with that! Most artists are naive marketers).
The show can be overt (like Cirque de Soleil) or quite subtle (like the music of chirping birds played outdoors at Epcot). But professionals know that they’re putting on a show and do it on purpose. Big company CEOs put the show on for guests and investors and underlings. It usually involves lots of assistants and waiting around. Sometimes, as Andy Grove demonstrated, the show involves sitting in a cubicle just like everyone else. Hiring HR people put on the show too.
If I parodied your show, your brand show or your personal show, would people recognize it? Could I spoof you on Seinfeld or imitate you if I were Rich Little?
The buying department at WalMart is one big show, with tiny cubicles and all sorts of rules of engagement. And of course the TSA is nothing but security theatre.
If you had a budget for props, what would you buy? What about costumes?
Your resume might put on a show, and perhaps you put one on at work. Kevin at Digg puts on a show, and does Carly Fiorina and every successful politician you’ve ever met. Some people insist that they’re not putting on a show. That’s a show too, of course.
If you can live the role, really be in it, and be transparent about your motivations, putting on a show is productive and highly leveraged. If you work in customer service, marketing yourself as friendly (and being friendly!) is far more effective than just acting however you feel in any given moment, isn’t it? That’s because, if you’re good at it, you realize that becoming a friendly customer service marketer is exactly what you need to do. Not pretend to be friendly, actuallybefriendly.
On the other hand, even if you’re a professional marketer, if your show is cynical or manipulative, it’s going to fall apart on you. Even Marlon Brando couldn’t live the show all the time if he didn’t believe it.
The difference between a professional and a naive marketer is that the professional can put on a different show in her next job, or for her next brand. Al Yeganeh, on the other hand, can only sell soup.
The difference between a company that makes stuff and a company that markets is that the latter is conscious of the fact that the market demands a show. So they put one on, on purpose, the best they can.
The next time you build a trade show booth or answer the phone or write an email, take a moment to think a little bit about the show.",,"Marketing, Professionalism, Branding"
Angry people are different,"Angry people are different from other people. They are not just an inch or two along some curve. Instead, there’s a gap in the curve, a vertical chasm, separating the angry from everyone else.
You may encounter angry prospects (angry before you even got there) or angry customers or angry regulators or even angry employees. They’re similar to each other but different from the rest of us.
It’s tempting to treat an angry person just like a typical person, just… angrier. This is probably a mistake, because anger brings its own reality along with it. An angry customer isn’t just a little less valuable than a non-angry customer. In fact, she’s on a curve all her own.
I have two suggestions for dealing with angry folks:
""I’m never coming back to this restaurant again!"" is angry.""Our special next week is lasagna…"" isn’t going to do the trick as a response.
""I’m angry that my candidate didn’t win the primary,""so, ""Consider my health plan,"" isn’t going to work.

The spirit of the game,"There are two ways to get ahead. You can work the system or you can beat the system.
Beating the system usually involves some sort of subterfuge. Once everyone knows how you beat the system, the system adjusts and changes the rules, making it difficult for you to repeat the feat again. When card counters beat the system in Las Vegas, they weren’t breaking the rules, but the system didn’t care. They just increased the number of decks in use so it would be more difficult and less lucrative. When athletes beat the system by doping, the system adjusts so it’s either a lot more difficult or less of an advantage.
Years ago, leading accounting firms were pitching wealthy prospects the idea of ""perfectly legal"" tax shelters that would lead to paying zero taxes on investments. You guessed it… the secret leaked out and they were busted.
Working the system is very different. Far from being secret, working the system is public and honored. WhenMalcolm Gladwellworks the system to deliver two stunning bestsellers in a row, booksellers and publishers don’t quickly make it more difficult to write books that appeal to a large audience… instead, his competitors work to raise their game and everyone benefits. WhenBill Boomertaught the US Olympic team to swim in a very different way, he had nothing to hide, because he was working within the spirit of the game.
The web is nothing but a system, a bunch of (largely unwritten) rules regarding search, linking, promotion, etc. It’s fascinating to watch assomepeopleworkhardtowork the system, and succeed time and time again, while others waste countless hours with one scheme after another designed tobeatthe system. They invent cloaking devices and seo scams and pyramid schemes and lightly disguised spam pages, constantly struggling to stay ahead (and to stay quiet). Sure, you can beat the system (any system) for a while, but it’s a constant struggle.
InUltimate Frisbee, there are no referees. The system insists that you make your own calls… players closest to the play call it, with no real appeals. The goal: play in the spirit of the game. If you keep working to beat the system, you’ll end up with no one to play with.

How to read a business book,"I like readingmagic books.
I don’t do magic. Not often (and not well). But reading the books is fun. It’s a vicarious thing, imagining how a trick might work, visualizing the effect and then smiling at how the technique is done. One after another, it’s a pleasant adventure.
A lot of people readbusiness booksin just the same way. They cruise through the case studies or the insights or examples and imagine what it would be like to be that brilliant entrepreneur or that successful CEO or that great sales rep. A pleasant adventure.
There’s a huge gap between most how-to books (cookbooks, gardening, magic, etc.) andbusiness books, though. The gap is motivation. Gardening books don’t push you to actually do something. Cookbooks don’t spend a lot of time trying to sell you on why making a roast chicken isn’t as risky as you might think.
The stakes are a lot higher when it comes to business.
Wreck a roast chicken and it’s $12 down the drain. Wreck a product launch and there goes your career…
I’m passionate about writing business books precisely for this reason. There are more business books sold than most other non-fiction categories for the same reason. High stakes, high rewards.
The fascinating thing is this: I spend 95% of my time persuading people to take action and just 5% of the time on the recipes.
The recipe that makes up just about any business book can becondensedto just two or three pages. The rest is the sell. The proof. The persuasion.
Which leads to your role as the reader. How to read a business book… it’s not as obvious as it seems.
If you’re reading for the recipe, and just the recipe, you can get through a business book in just a few minutes. But most people who do that get very little out of the experience. Take a look at the widely divergentreviewsfor The Dip. The people who ‘got it’ understood that it was a book about getting you to change your perspective and thus your behavior. Those that didn’t were looking for bullet points. They wasted their money.
Computer books, of course, are nothing but bullet points. Programmers get amazing value because for $30 they are presented with everything they need to program a certain tool. Yet most programmers are not world class, precisely because the bullet points aren’t enough to get them to see things the way the author does, and not enough to get them motivated enough to actually program great code.
So, how to read a business book:
1. Decide, before you start, that you’re going to change three things about what you do all day at work. Then, as you’re reading, find the three things and do it. The goal of the reading, then, isn’t to persuade you to change, it’s to help you choosewhatto change.
2. If you’re going to invest a valuable asset (like time), go ahead and make it productive. Use a postit or two, or some index cards or a highlighter. Not to write down stuff so you can forget it later, but to create marching orders. It’s simple: if three weeks go by and you haven’t taken action on what you’ve written down, you wasted your time.
3. It’s not about you, it’s about the next person. The single best use of a business book is to help someone else. Sharing what you read, handing the book to a person who needs it… pushing those around you to get in sync and to take action–that’s the main reason it’s a book, not a video or a seminar. A book is a souvenir and a container and a motivator and an easily leveraged tool. Hoarding books makes them worth less, not more.
Effective managers hand books to their team. Not so they can be reminded of high school, but so that next week she can say to them, ""are we there yet?""","May 21, 2008","business books, motivation, action"
Competition,"A few readers have pinged me, asking how I can post to other blogs that write stuff similar to mine. ""Aren’t you promoting the competition?""
Two part answer. First, I don’t think most authors have competition (except television). The more you read, the better we do. That’s why bookstores are great places to sell books… even though all the competition is right there.
More relevant to you, the web works when you link out. Hoarding attention (like CNET did for a long time and about.com does like crazy) is a no-win strategy. Shared attention doesn’t dissipate, it grows.
Here’s some more competition to contemplate:
Bill Tayloron Zappos’ amazing buyout offer.

The new standard for meetings and conferences,"If oil is $130 a barrel and if security adds two or three hours to a trip and if people are doing more and more business with those far afield…
and if we need to bring together more people from more places when we get together…
and if the alternatives, like video conferencing or threaded online conversations continue to get better and better, then…
I think the standard for a great meeting or a terrific conference has changed.
In other words, ""I flew all the way here forthis?""is going to be far more common than it used to be.
If you think a great conference is one where the presenters read a script while showing the audience bullet points, you’re wrong. Or if you leave little time for attendees to engage with others, or worse, if you don’t provide the levers to make itmore likelythat others will engage with each other, you’re wrong as well.
Here’s what someone expects if they come to see you on an in-person sales call: that you’ll be prepared, focused, enthusiastic and willing to engage honestly about the next steps. If you can’t do that, don’t have the meeting.
Here’s what a speaker owes an audience that travels to engage in person: more than they could get by just reading the transcript.
And here’s what a conference organizer owes the attendees: surprise, juxtaposition, drama, engagement, souvenirs and just possibly, excitement.
I’m on a roll here, so let me add one more new standard:
If you’re a knowledge worker, your boss shouldn’t make you come to the (expensive) office every day unless there’s something there that makes it worth your trip. She needs to provide you with resources or interactions or energy you can’t find at home or at Starbucks. And if she does invite you in, don’t bother showing up if you’re just going to sit quietly.
I’ve worked in three companies that had lots of people and lots of cubes, and I spent the entire day walking around. I figured that was my job. The days where I sat down and did what looked like work were my least effective days. It’s hard for me to see why you’d bother having someone come all the way to an office just to sit in a cube and type.
The new rule seems to be that if you’re going to spend the time and the money to see someone face to face, be in their face. Interact or stay home!","May 19, 2008","meetings, engagement, conferences"

Why word of mouth doesn’t happen,"Sometimes, what you do is done as well as it can be done. It’s a service that people truly love, or a product they can’t live without. You’re doing everything right, but it’s not remarkable, at least not in the sense of ""worth making a remark about.""
What’s up with that?
Here’s a smörgåsbord of reasons:
First, understand that people talk about you (or not talk about you) because of how it makes them feel, not how it makes you feel.
Second, if you’re going to build a business around word of mouth, better not have these things working against you.
Third, if you do, it may be a smart strategy to work directly to overcome them. That probably means changing the fundamental DNA of your experience and the story you tell to your users. ""If you like us, tell your friends,"" might feel like a fine start, but it’s certainly not going to get you there.

Packaging for retail,"Item 1: My Logitech cordlessremote(which I like a lot) came in plastic, non-recyclable packaging thatweighed twice as much as the remote itself.* The plastic was so wellsealed and so thick that I actually broke a kitchen knife trying toopen it. (*this is not hyperbole. I weighed it).
This is expensive, time-consuming and positions the product as extremely ungreen.
This packaging is the result of a paranoid retail buyer (the person who orders in bulk for the store, not the buyer at retail) demandingpilfer-proof packaging combined with a lazy brand manager choosing alousy solution to the challenge presented by getting it into a retailer. ""Make it pilfer-proof or we won’t carry it,"" he says. The brand manager doesn’t want to take a risk, so she packages it the way they packaged it when the device cost $1,000. Impregnable.
When you buy it from Amazon, of course, a cardboardsleeve would be sufficient. The manufacturer, though, only wants to have one sku, so Amazon sells the wasteful one as well.
So, why not compromise and shrink wrap it to a cardboard backad? A simple piece of cardboard, 8 x 10, impossible to fit under your jacket, much lighter, easy to recycle, cheaper and easier to ship.
Item 2: Those stickers on digital cameras that say things like ""8megapixels"". Why is there a sticker on the camera that you don’t evensee until you’ve already purchased it?
Because one out of 100 boxes are opened by the store to put ondisplay. By stickering ALL the cameras, they can be sure to get thatsticker on the one that gets in the case… I am just fascinated bythis. It seems so clever. The mystery is why the digital photos thatthey provide to Amazon et. al. don’t have the stickers affixed.
Lessons: Package your stuff so that it works at retail. Put stickers on things that are going to get unboxed. Create sample kits. Consideroffering a second package to Amazon. Think about cutting down weightand customer angst by making pilfer-proof packaging that is lighter,easier to open and recyclable. You save money and you sell more stuff.

Lenore Godin’s son,"[Intentionally posted on a day that’s not Mother’s Day].
My mom always disliked Mother’s Day. She had a few good reasons.
First, she pointed out that anytime you do something because you’resupposed to, or because everyone else is doing it, it’s not worth as much.Flowers the week before or a nice poem the day after were pricelesscompared to the trudge to the restaurant on the appointed day.
I think this is true of all marketing. Nice words to a customer theday they say they’re quitting, or to an employee during an annualreview aren’t worth much at all, imho.
Second, she didn’t understand why it was necessary to commercializesomething that worked even better when it was free. Just because youcan market something for a profit doesn’t mean you should.
As for me, I’m amazed at all the folks who would talk about thelessons they learned from their mom and would act that way, at leastfor a few hours… but then would spend the rest of the year as ifthey’d been raised by wolves.

We specialize in everything,"If the world is really bigger, if you can find the best in the world to do what you want, no matter what it is you want, does that change things?
If I need an animator, I can find the world’s best animator. If I need a bond to insure my movie, I can find the best broker at selling completion bonds. If I need SEO help, get me the world’s best SEO person. If I need braces, I can find the best orthodontist in my area. Not the second-best or someone who will try really hard or someone who is pretty good at that and also good at other things. Sure, there are occasional tasks where a diagnostician with wide-ranging experience is important (but I’d argue that that’s a specialty in and of itself).
When choice is limited, I want a generalist. When selection is difficult, a jack of all trades is just fine.
But whenever possible, please bring me a brilliant specialist.

I rely on generalists all the time, and so do you. My point is that you never call on these people when there’s a better specialist available. And in the old days, a little town could only support one generalist, so it wasn’t an issue. Today, especially in high-value situations, that’s just not the case. So, yes, generalize.

Marketing the charity auction,"How much would you pay for a twenty dollar bill?
In tough times, many schools and non-profits rely on charity fundraisers, and a popular one is the auction. The method is simple: supporters donate things, and then they’re auctioned off, with all proceeds going to charity.
If you have a vacation house, the thinking goes, the incremental cost of donating a week is low. And wow, I can buy a week at that house for way less than it’s worth. Everyone wins.
If you have a friend who works on the Letterman show, you can get two VIP tickets for free and donate them and someone at the auction gets to go to the show for not so much money.
This bargain hunting is fine as far as it goes, but it never leads to a wildly successful auction, because the story that’s told is too small.
If you’re only willing to bid $19 to buy a $20 bill at this auction, you’re not doing charity, you’re bargain hunting. There’s nothing wrong with bargain hunting, it’s fun, but it’s not philanthropy. I think bargain hunting for a good cause is just fine, but wouldn’t it be great if the event could raise far more money and change the way people view the organization?
The Robin Hood Foundation raised more than 24 million dollars at their last auction, because people competed to overpay. And that’s the secret. The story the charity must tell is: ""don’t pay $19 for this twenty dollar bill, don’t even pay $30, we need you to pay $40!""The satisfaction of overpaying(whether you overpay anonymously or in public) is what they sell, not a bargain.
This is not the easy path. It is much easier to sell your public on bargains than it is to sell them on generosity. The good news is that once you get over the hump, it scales. Bargains scale downward… better bargains are lower-priced bargains, which means you scale to zero. Philanthropy scales upward… better overpaying is more overpaying. A public auction is always a public competition. The challenge is to create social approval for what would otherwise be bad auction skills! Enlist a few stooges in the audience in advance, then start by auctioning off that $20 bill. When it goes for $45 and the winner gets an ovation, you’ve set a tone.
The goal of a non-profit seeking money needs to be to create an environment in which the community congratulates itself on overpaying.","May 9, 2008","charity auction, philanthropy, fundraising"

Four more words,"Connect like-minded people.

The Media markets,"The product they sell is drama.
When I went to business school, we spent an entire 90 minute class on how to read the Wall Street Journal. That’s a rare treat… being taught how to understand and psyche out the media.
With the vast bulk of our news coming online now, it’s worth taking a second to look at the way mainstream media markets drama. You know and I know that they’re doing this, but maybe it’ll strike a chord with someone…
Take a look at a screen shot from the front page of CNN.com today:
I put a green checkbox next to every statement on the page that might be considered ‘true’ but could certainly be considered irrelevant, or at least unimportant compared to the actual ‘news’.
The page would have been more accurate if it had said things like, ""Obama gains more than 200,000 votes over Clinton"" or ""Obama campaign further extends delegate lead, picking up 12 more delegates"" or even ""Obama pummels Clinton in the bigger state.""
That’s not dramatic, though, and as William Randolph Hearsttaught usa long time ago, the goal is to sell newspapers, not to report the news.
There isn’t media bias in favor of Hillary (my friendJeffis the first to point that out). Nor is there media bias in favor of floods. There’s media bias in favor of drama.

All the News That Fits (do what you’re great at),"The New York Times, like all newspapers, is in big trouble.
Unlike other papers, though, they’ve got a shot. And we can all learn a lesson about focusing on the great (by looking at what they should be doing, anyway).
All the News That’s Fit to Print used to be the motto they lived by. Of course, now, all the news that fits = the web. Unlimited space and free newsprint means the web can actually holdallthe news. ""Fit"" is a big question mark.
So, where can the Times excel?
I’d argue they have two opportunities:1. If it’s in the Times, it’s true2. If it’s in the Times, it’s important
I should clarify. By ‘true’, I mean vetted as well as can be vetted, I mean more true than other places. They can never reach this level of course, but they can try harder than most and they can be transparent and they can admit when they’re wrong and correct it. Lots of noise online, not so much truth.
By ‘important’, I mean ‘important because everyone else is reading the same thing.’ So, for example, the NY Times bestseller list is important. A half page story about the last factory making washboards is important. A glowing, thoughtful review of an overlooked opera is important. It’s important because the Times becomes one of the last cultural touchstones, the thing the other smart people read.
The mistake the Times is making, over and over and over again, is that few of the stories in the paper are edited with these wins in mind. I’m just not sure that anyone there has a list of what they’re great at, or want to be great at.
Monday featured TWO stories about Barbara Walters and her new book. Why? We don’t need the Times for ‘truth’ here, and while it may be important to Knopf and to Barbara, it’s not really that important to us.
Sunday, my local version of the Times featured an in-depth restaurant review of the Olive Garden! And it was for a location 30 miles from my house (they’re saving money by combining regional editions). Ouch.
If I were editing the Times, I’d look at every single editorial feature, every single article and ask if it met either of the two things the Times could stand for. If not, that piece should be gone, deleted, unassigned. No sports section, for example. If you can’t be the best in the world, don’t bother, because someone else is going to get my attention. The Times needs 50 more bestseller lists, 20 more trusted stories about real political fact and insight, ten more cultural touchstone features… and a lot less filler, a lot less copycat stuff and nothing, nothing about Barbara Walters.
[Not because I don’t like Barbara Walters. Merely because a link to the other sites that can happily review and sell me her book is far more effective than wasting time and resources flogging a book that needs no flogging. Pick 20 books a day and point to them, don’t write vapid features about three every week. The Times does better when they find something we don’t know about and celebrate it instead.]
These choices represent the same quandary you face. Your product line, your choices, your services… if you obsess about doing the thing you are great at and let the mediocre stuff go, you’ll do far better.

More on passion and pop,"The postabout the gulf between passion and pop touched a chord.
A few readers remembered Geoff Moore’s classicCrossing the Chasm. This is a super book (particularly the original (used) edition, not the updated one). Geoff has a different take on the curves, but his approach is well worth a look, especially for technology related products.
A few other readers wrote in, pointing out that they are going for both. Both passion and pop because the flexibility of the web makes it easy to do that. Of course, it doesn’t, not really. Going for both is rarely the right strategy.
Most germane: the two humps are not static. They move. Sometimes you can move them (I think Apple did) and sometimes the market moves on its own (music, for example). Most businesses don’t have the patience or the resources to move the Pop hump on their own, and I think it’s usually foolish to try. Passion, on the other hand, is always fast moving, and if you have something extraordinary and there’s a cadre of believers, the passionate will find you.","May 6, 2008","passion, pop, strategy"
Avoiding the Passion Pop Gulf,"Here’s a new curve for you: I’m calling it the passion/pop curve.
That bell curve to the left represents acceptance by the focused/excited/tastemaking community. Those are the people who love microbeers and haute couture and Civil War memorabilia. Like all market curves, there’s a sweet spot. Go too nutsy on us ($90,000 turntables, for example) and even the committed will flee. Go too pop, though, and we’ll avoid you as well.
Simple example: Jazz. If you do atonal world jazz played in the dark underwater, few people will come. On the other hand, you won’t get many jazz fans at a Spyrogyra concert either. Too pop.
The bell curve on the right, you’ll notice, is bigger. This is a second market, a bigger market, the market of pop. These are the folks who go to the Olive Garden for a nice italian meal instead of the authentic place down the street. They too want something that’s not too edgy and not too (in their opinion) trite.
The reason you need to care is that gap in the middle. Every day, millions of businesses get stuck in that gap. They either move to the right in search of the masses or move to the left in search of authenticity, but they compromise. And they get stuck with neither.
A delta blues guy who plays for tiny audiences in Memphis is in the sweet spot of the passionate. John Mayer is in the sweet spot of pop. Both are great guitarists, neither is too edgy or too trite. Both made a choice. But there are a thousand guitarists who are neither. They’re afraid to embrace one curve or the other and end up with neither.
You can move a curve one or way or the other… the curves change all the time. Chuck Mangione was pop for a while, much to the derision of the jazz purists. Now, though, the curve of pop has moved and Chuck can’t possibly chase it down.
It’s not just musicians, of course. Even dentists face this quandary. Should you be the most expensive, best trained, most extreme dentist in the world, catering to the edge of the passion market, or perhaps develop a chain of $19 five-minute whitening shops for the outer edge of the pop market?
You might get lucky and end up with a sweet spot accidentally. Inevitably, you’ll itch to move to the other curve (cause it’s bigger or because it feels more authentic) and I worry about your ability to do that.
The best choice is to choose.","May 5, 2008","Passion Pop Curve, Market Dynamics, Authenticity"
Four words,"Make big promises; overdeliver.
If you can define great marketing in fewer words than that, you win.
""Big promises"": treating people with respect, improving self-esteem, delivering results, contacting as often as you say you will but not more, including side effects in your planning, delivering joy, meeting spec, being on time, connecting people to one another, delivering consistency, offering value and on and on. Caring. The stories involved in your promises matter. That’s often what people are buying.
This is the first place that the equation breaks down. Marketers often make big promises that appear to be unrealistic or are delivered in ways that don’t match the worldview of the prospect. Marketers get carried away with themselves and focused on their greatness and forget to tell a story that people enjoy believing.
And sometimes, they make promises that are too small to get our attention. Boring promises are hardly worth making.
""Overdeliver"" means doing more than you said you would, which is the secret to word of mouth.
Here, of course, the pitfall is obvious. You made too big a promise and you did your best, but no, you didn’t overdeliver, not really. You didn’t amaze and delight and yes, stun me with the incredible results of your offering.
Just because it’s only four words doesn’t mean it’s easy!","May 4, 2008","Marketing, Promises, Overdelivery"
The coming backlash over green marketing,"Micahpoints us to this campaign fromTumiLuggage. Buy some nylon luggage, they’ll plant some trees (one tree? A bush? It’s not clear how many trees per suitcase). It’s entirely possible that Tumi’s campaign is nothing short of generous, but as a consumer, it’s awfully difficult to tell.
The easiest marketing promise to make is to say you’ll do something green if people consume what you sell. That you’ll support one green cause or another. No one is in charge of checking out your story, and my guess is that 90% of the time, it leads to a net negative–more landfill, more carbon, more waste.
I can still remember a car commercial that ran when I was a teenager… during the first big energy crisis. It touted that a certain brand of car was the one to buy, not because it got better mileage, but because it had a bigger tank! ""Range,"" the announcer intoned, ""is what you need in a car.""
Consumers aren’t stupid (we’re dumb sometimes, but not stupid.) So, when the backlash hits, when every single brand has used up some green angle, then what?
Here’s what’s missing: a number. When you buy a fridge, there’s a big yellow sticker with a number about relative energy consumption. Now, we could argue all day long about how to figure out the right number (should the number on the fridge include data about the amount of energy needed to make the fridge in the first place?) but an imperfect number sure seems better than no number at all.
Drive to Philadelphia: 150.Take Amtrak: 22.
Stick with the lightbulbs you have throughout your whole house until they burn out: 175.Replace them all now with something better: 142.
Organic strawberries from California: 88Frozen strawberries from California: 80Apple from Dutchess County: 4
The power of a number is the effect we saw when they put a number on restaurants (Zagats) and wines (Parker) and gas mileage (the EPA). People notice a number, and they work to improve it. If every car sold in our country had a real-time gas consumption meter on the dashboard and the rear window, things would change very fast. The only change from the status quo would be the story (communicating impact) but marketing the story is our biggest challenge right now. Once we communicate the most efficient path, I think we’ll be delighted at how many people take it. Right now, marketers are doing a lousy job of that, devolving into short-term, often selfish come-ons. That’s not going to last and it’s not going to scale.
Marketers who truly care about the green thing should be scrambling right now to find a number or an organization that can defend the green brand.

Sucking all the juice out,"Just got some work back from a new copyeditor hired by my publisher. She did a flawless job. She also wrecked my work. Totally wrecked it.
By sanding off every edge, removing every idiom, making each and every fact literally correct, she made it boring and dry and mechanical.
If they have licenses for copyeditors, she should have hers revoked.
I need to be really clear. She’s not at fault. She did exactly what she was supposed to do. The fault lies in the job description, not the job. If the job description of your lawyer or boss or editor or client is to make sure everything is pure and perfect and proven and beyond reproach, they are making things worse, not better. (Unless you’re in the vaccine business).
Almost everything you do has some sort of copyediting filter. It might be the legal eagle or the graphic supervisor or the customer service police. They’re excellent at making round things fit perfectly through round holes.
Boring and ignored is fine with them, because no one complains.
Fortunately, copy editors have a remedy. It’s a word called STET. Which means, ""leave it alone, it was fine."" Time to teach that to your editors, wherever they may be. Maybe there should be a t-shirt.
If all you want is safe, have baby food for dinner. Just leave me out of it.",,"copyediting, creativity, STET"

The first rule of b2b selling,"If it gets to the RFP stage, you lost.
Great business to business marketers (and profitable ones) make the sale long before that happens.
The RFP is an organizational punt, it’s a way of saying, ""it’s all a commodity, we can’t decide, cheap guy wins.""
The cheap guy, of course, never wins.",,"B2B Selling, RFP Stage, Business Marketing"
Bravery and Wall-e,"At every turn, Pixar messed up the marketing of their new movie. It has a hard to spell name, no furry characters, not nearly enough dialogue (the first 45 minutes is almost silent), no nasty (but ultimately ridiculous) bad guy, hardly any violence and very little slapstick. Wall-e didn’t get a huge Hollywood PR campaign or even a lot of promotion, it doesn’t feature any hot stars and as far as I can tell, the merchandising options are quite limited.
Can you imagine the meetings?
Can you imagine the yelling?
Pixar, recently purchased by Disney, could crank out multi-billion dollar confections. They know all the moves, they have the chops to create merchandising powerhouses. And with just one movie a year, they certainly must have been under huge pressure to do just that.
And yet, instead, they make a great movie. A movie for the ages. A film, not 90 minutes of commerce.
The irony, of course, is that they’ll make plenty of money. Bravery often pays off, even if paying off is not your goal.Especiallyif that’s not your goal.
Marketing isn’t always about pandering to the masses and shooting for the quick payoff. Often, the best marketing doesn’t feel like marketing at all.","June 30, 2008","Bravery, Wall-e, Marketing"
The magic of low-hanging fruit,"Imagine that half the cars in the US get 10 miles per gallon. And half get 40 miles per gallon. Further stipulate that all cars are driven the same number of miles per year.
Now, you get one wish. You can give every low-mileage car a new set of spark plugs that will increase fuel efficiency by 5 mpg, up to 15. Or you can replace every 40 mpg car with a car that gets 75 mpg, an increase of 35 miles for every gallon driven.
Which is better?
It turns out that the 5 mpg increase is far better for overall mileage than the 35 mpg increase, even though it’s smaller both as a percentage and absolutely. That’s because the 10 mpg hogs use up so much gas. They’re the low-hanging fruit, not just easy to fix, but worth fixing.
As marketers, we’re tempted to tweak the already tweaked, to turn the 100 to 101, to optimize for the peak performances. That long tail is very long, though, and if there’s a way you can raise the floor (instead of just focusing on the ceiling) you may be surprised to discover that it can have a huge impact.
Simple example: It’s way more profitable to encourage each of your existing customers to spend $3 than it is to get a stranger to spend $300. It’s also more effective to get the 80% of your customer service people that are average to be a little better than it is to get the amazing ones to be better still.","June 29, 2008","low-hanging fruit, fuel efficiency, customer engagement"
How to organize the room,"One more post about conferences.(Except it’s really aboutanymeeting).
Easily overlooked, but incredibly important: the way you arrange the room where people speak.
The venue owner (hotel/convention center) wants something easy. Your boss wants something cheap. You want something tried and true so you don’t get blamed. The end result?Mediocrity. Boring sameness. What a wasted opportunity.
In the scheme of things, a great room at a conference is a bargain. Spending what it takes to make it work has a huge payoff. That said, here are some thoughts:
“What does this remind me of?”
That’s the subliminal question that people ask themselves as soon as they walk into a room. If it reminds us of a high school cafeteria, we know how to act. If it’s a bunch of round tables set for a chicken dinner, we know how to act. And if there are row upon row of hotel-type chairs in straight lines, we know how to sit and act glazed.
If it’s a place where we’re used to saying ‘no’, we’re likely to say no. If it’s a place where we’re used to good news or important news or just paying attention, we’ll do that.
You can use this Pavlovian reaction to your advantage, or you can be a victim of it. A non-traditional arrangement can make people sit up and take notice. A rock concert feel is going to raise the energy level of even the skeptics. A circle with no tables makes people feel naked. These are tools, and you get to choose.
If you have to serve lunch, serve lunch. Big round tables, lots of talking. Then have people stand up and go hear the speaker. In a different room, with a different setting, one that works. No one ever heard a speech that changed their lives when sitting around a round table having just eaten a lousy lunch. Mixing the settings serves no purpose, wastes time in the long run and saves very little money.
Do you see that this is just more marketing? You tell a story with where you put the chairs.
If you could do one thing, make one choice, it should be this: make the room too small. Standing room only. People hanging into the hall. Watch what happens to your energy level.
If you’re speaking TO people as opposed to encouraging a wide ranging discourse, put the stage along the narrow wall of the room. (in a 30 by 80 room, that means the 30 side). Making the room narrow and long is far better than wide, because it puts the audience in the plane of the speaker.
This also makes it far easier for the audience to see the speaker and the slides/screens at the same time. This is critical. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve watched people stare at the screen and avoid the speaker, or find themselves bouncing back and forth.
iMag: That’s the projection of the speaker on the screen. This is pretty expensive, but for groups over 500, it’s almost mandatory in our 1984-esque world. If you want to get far more bang for your buck, hire a second cameraman, with a hand held camera. When you switch from one view to the other, you add enormous action to the event.
Screens: Big screens are a lot more reasonable than they used to be. Get the absolute biggest and brightest you can afford. Bigger! Big screens, near the speaker. Really close to the speaker. That’s a big help for the audience and for your energy.
VGA cables: Have more than one. Switchers are cheap. Nothing worse than having speakers stumbling around swapping laptops. And put the cables and the laptops up front, not in back to be controlled by a tech guy who doesn’t care quite as much as you (or the speaker) does.
Music: Every time you introduce a speaker, play loud and inspiring pop music. Not for long, but enough to cue people to remember the way they feel at the Oscars and stuff. After all, those memes are there waiting for you to leverage them.
Marching bands: Yes, they’re cheap. No, people don’t like them particularly. I’ve seen this done a number of times, and people are more amazed and aghast than impressed.
Aisles: Watch a room fill up. People always sit on the aisle, don’t they? Don’t do rows of 40 or 50 chairs with no aisle. Have lots of aisles. Every ten chairs or so. Why not? Makes it faster to get in and to get out, and doesn’t hurt your density so much.
Lights: Make it dark in the audience. Make it light on stage. This works every time. Practice the lighting in advance, even for a smaller group.
Q&A: For large groups, don’t do Q&A. It sucks all the energy out of the room and stilts the end, “Well, if there are no more questions…” Instead, solicit questions from key people in advance, write them on index cards and have someone raring and ready to go with a microphone and a finite list of questions, bang, bang, bang. It’s not a press conference, it’s a speech.
Small groups: Even groups of two–don’t go along with a lousy setting just because that’s what is offered to you. Why would you pitch yourself or your project in a noisy restaurant, seated on a banquette, with one person on your left and two on your right? Don’t do it.
If you are using a laptop for a small group, get one with a big screen. Get a simple USB remote. Don’t use live web access if at all possible. And make sure that the right person sees the screen (and you) at the same time. If you can’t do these things, don’t use the laptop.
If you’re willing to travel to meet with someone, put in the extra effort to do it in a setting that works. Befriend the admin, befriend the maitre d, even from 1,000 miles away. Both you and the person you’re meeting with benefit when you create a room that works.","June 27, 2008","Room organization, conference setup, audience engagement"
Five easy pieces,"You really don’t understand a concept until you know what it’s made of. The taxonomy of marketing (filled with a bazillion tactics) is murky at best. The tactics are so numerous, expensive and sometimes emotional that we easily focus on the urgent instead of the important. Perhaps we could try a different approach:
Never mind the ""P""s. Marketing has five elements:DataStoriesProducts (services)InteractionsConnection
DATA is observational. What do people actually do? Wal-Mart uses data to decide if an end cap is working. Google Adwords advertisers use data to decide which copy delivers clicks and sales. The library can use data to decide which books to buy (and not to buy). Paco Underhill uses data to turbo chargeretail.Data is powerful, overlooked and sometimes mistaken for boring. You don’t have to understand the why, you merely need to know the what.
STORIES define everything you say and do. The product has a myth, the service has a legend. Marketing applies to every person, every job, every service and every organization. That’s because all we can work with as humans is stories. I want to argue that data and stories are the two key building blocks of marketing–the other three are built on these two.
PRODUCTS (and services) are physical manifestations of the story. If your story is that you are cutting edge and faster/newer/better, then your products better be. Average products for average people is a common story, but not one that spreads. When in doubt, re-imagine the product. Push it to be the story, to live the story, to create a myth.
INTERACTIONS are all the tactics the marketer uses to actually touch the prospect or customer. Interactions range from spam to billboards, from the way you answer the phone to the approach you take to an overdue bill. Interactions are the hero of marketing, because there are so many and most of them are cheap. Unfortunately, all lazy marketers can do is buy ads or spam people. Which creates an interaction that belies your story, right?
CONNECTION is the highest level of enlightenment, the end goal. Connection between you and the customer, surely, but mostly connection between customers. Great marketers create bands of brothers, tribes of people who wish each other well and want to belong. Get the first four steps right and you may get a shot at this one.
Some questions marketers must ask: Does this interaction lead to connections? Do our products support our story? Is the story pulling in numbers that demonstrate that it’s working?
In that light, what are you working on? If it’s not one of these five, not going to seriously change the dynamic of your marketing, why exactly are you bothering?
My guess is that your organization spends almost all of its time on the interactions. Once you see the world through the prism of the five pieces, you can get in balance. Or, you could beJack.","June 25, 2008","marketing, data, storytelling"
Learning from frustration,"I’m moving this week (new mailing address: Box 305, Irvington, NY 10533).
That meant a grueling marathon with the single worst voice routing VR system the world has ever known: Verizon.
Rants online can be good for the soul, but it’s way more interesting as a marketer to learn from what’s not working.
Most often, a frustrating situation is frustratingnotbecause the tactics were broken, but because the strategy is fundamentally flawed. In this case, Verizon is acting like a monopoly (they’re not, at least not any more) and they are viewing customer interactions as an expense, not an investment.
If you view calls from paying customers as expensive, then your goal will be to cut the cost of these interactions. That means fewer hours, more voice recognition and more wasted time by your customers. Once you’ve gone down that road, everything else seems like a soft-hearted, expensive compromise.
So, I start by flipping this on its head. Verizon spends a fortune on advertising and outbound marketing. How much of that budget would they have to allocate/invest in order to turn their customer service into a discussion-worthy best in the world? Or at least enough to keep people from switching in disgust? Not much, it turns out.
This leads quite easily to the first conceptual breakthrough: waste your time, not mine! Be open 24 hours a day, because, after all, the amount of customer service you need to do doesn’t decrease if you work fewer hours. In other words, spread your people around so they can talk when your customers want to talk.
Wait, you say, we can’t afford to have our trained engineers working at night, or they won’t work those hours.
No problem. Instead of using a VR system, just route the calls to a different time zone, to alert, kind, English-speaking folks who will carefully enter every detail into a database,  including the return contact info and the best time to call back.
Now, when I call, I spend less than a minute or two with you. The phone is answered on the first ring. Someone sympathetic gets every single detail. Magically, using the best technologies of telemarketing, my cell phone rings at the appointed hour and the right person with the right expertise and the right file in front of them is sitting at the other end, just waiting to talk with me! Instead of wasting my energy with six (yes, I had six, and that was just today) people who couldn’t help me, I get to talk to one who can. In fact, this process actually saves Verizon money.
Wait, there’s more.
We need deadend safeguards, too. That means after someone has been on hold for more than xx minutes, the call automatically gets escalated to a more powerful person who can take action right then, right there. (Can you agree that this should happen after 4 hours? What about 40 minutes?)
It means that you don’t ask me to type in my phone number or account number, but if you insist, then at the very least you make sure that the person who eventually gets my call doesn’t ask me for my number again! Getting this wrong for three years in a row is not an error. It’s arrogance.
If you have to put me on hold, don’t play bad 1980s music. Play me Bill Cosby or Steven Wright. Or why not give me a choice of 100 songs/audiobooks to choose from?
Here’s the big lesson, I think: The person calling in is a person, a customer, potentially a blogger, potentially the CEO of a company you might want to sell to tomorrow, and yes, the person you’ve spent all that time and money marketing to.
It’s not about technology. A small firm could accomplish all this with a decent Radio Shack answering machine and a better attitude.","June 24, 2008","Customer service, frustration, marketing strategy"
One swell foop,"It’s not very often you hear people use the word ""fell"" without the obligatory ""swoop"", but the combination is common enough that we all know what it means.
Except it rarely happens.
We expect that a big marketing campaign can fix our market share problems in one fell swoop.
Or that a consultant can reorganize our operation and get it working again in one fell swoop.
Or that a new product launch is only a swoop away from setting things right.
Of course, that’s not what happens. It’s more like 35 semi-fell swoops that do the trick. And deep down, we realize that.
But, now that we’ve said it out loud, now that you acknowledge that you’re going to need 35 web visits or permission-based emails or 35 different conference appearances or 35 blog posts or whatever, drip, drip, drip… if you know that you need 35, not one, how would write/appear/act differently?

Saying thanks in a conference presentation,"I hear quite a few presentations given at conferences. Approximately 5% of the official welcome speech consists of a litany of thanks. The organizer is busy thanking the committee that handled the arrangements, the sponsors, the executive director, the tireless volunteers. I’ve heard people try hard to read the names superfast, or really slowly, or mumble through them…
Not only is this a total waste of time for most attendees, it doesn’t even satisfy the core objective, which is thanking and rewarding the folks who helped. And it certainly doesn’t encourage others to look forward to helping out.
The list is impossible to remember, said too fast and dull.
The solution is pretty simple, thanks to Powerpoint and digital cameras.
Prepare for the talk by taking pictures of each person. If they’re shy, you can even do photographs in groups of two or three. Good photos, clever photos, funny photos… photos that are interesting are best.
Then, create a new presentation. Put each photo on its own slide, preferably with a well designed ID below it (it should be on a black box, with a nice sans serif font reversed out. Like you see on cable TV news.)
String one after the other. Build a dissolve transition between each one. Program it to put up a new slide every two seconds–don’t go too slow!–and to loop the presentation.
Ten minutes before you’re due to start, while everyone is finding their seats, run the presentation. It’ll cycle 5 or 10 times before you start speaking. When you get up, start your presentation and just dive into the meaty stuff.
Every single person you feature will be famous! ""Hey, I saw you in that loop!""
And you won’t have wasted your valuable presentation time.",,"conference presentation, thanking people, creative acknowledgment"
Simple conference idea,"At the next conference you run, allocate an hour for table sessions.
Divide the number of attendees by 10. That’s how many tables of ten you need. Give each table a theme or topic (entrepreneurship, shoe collectors, whining about the economy, whatever). Post the themes online for people to sign up in advance for each table. First come first served, you don’t get to see who’s at the table till you get there.
A month after the conference, do you think people will remember the table where they spent an hour? When you force people through mild social anxiety, they thank you for it later.

Random thoughts about the Kindle,"Might be of interest to investors, readers, writers, designers, marketers, etc. Or not…
Two months ago, I got a Kindle. It’s a fascinating device, unlike almost any other launched by a significant tech company. Here’s why:
1. It’s for women andwomenare buying it. The bestseller list of Kindle titles is much lesstech-heavy than Amazon’s list was in the early days of the web. AnOprah book is #1. And the colors and feel of the machine don’t feellike the current uber-geek tech dream device.
This is a fascinating strategy. It means that typical technologymarketing and adoption strategies aren’t in play, since most techdevices go after nerdy men. It means a slower start (since paying $400for technology is a stretch unless it’s your passion) but also possiblya much bigger finish.
2. I just got rid of 3,000 books in preparation for an office move.That’s two decades worth of reference books. I realized that most ofthe books I bought I didn’t use any more (thanks to wikipedia andgoogle) and that buying books in anticipation of giving them to someoneelse was generous but not actually happening in practice. For the tinyslice of readers that account for a huge pile of book sales (300 booksa year adds up), moving those purchases to the Kindle is smart forAmazon and smart for the reader.
3. It changes (at least for me) what it means to buy and own a book.Delivery is very fast, and I feel a lot less badly about stopping abook on page 10 if it doesn’t interest me (sunk costs should beignored, but that’s hard to do–if a book’s not worth reading, one should stop). As a writer, this raises the bar evenfurther in terms of keeping people with me past chapter one if they’reusing this device.
4. The Kindle does a fine job of being a book reader, and a horriblejob of actually improving the act of reading a book. This is a surprisingdesign choice, I think, and a mistake. Here are three simple examplesof how non-fiction books on the Kindle could be better, not justcheaper and thinner:
–Let me see the best parts of the book as highlighted by thousands of other readers.–Let me see notes in the margin as voted up, Digg-style, by thousands of other readers.–Let me interact with hyperlinks and smart connections not just within the book but across books
I can think of ten others, and so can you. Instead of making this adead end (like a book) they could have made it a connector (like theweb).
Word processing didn’t work because it was typing but a littlecheaper. It worked because it was better than typing. Email didn’t workbecause it was mail but a little faster. It worked because it wasfundamentally better than snail mail…
5. The pricing of books iswhacked.$9.95 is a publisher-friendly price, not an author-friendly or reader-friendly price.
My first thought is that every Kindle should ship with $1,000 worthof free books on it. I offered Amazon rights to as many of my books asI control if they would just agree to put em free on every Kindle. Theydeclined. I can think of a hundred authors who would be delighted toput one or more of their backlist books in front of this book-hungry audience.
Once you have a device that lets you get any book in a few seconds,one that eliminates both paper and inventory (the two enemies of everypublisher and bookstore) then the marginal cost of a book dropsdramatically. And as we learned at the iTunes store, when somethingcosts a buck, it’s a fundamentally different purchase than when itcosts $10 or $20.
The funny thing is: I’ve heard from a few publishers about my comment about pricing, and they’ve pointed out that authors would be hurt if the price was lowered, because, they argue, the royalties would go down. This is nuts, of course, because volume would go up, and the author percentage rate would go up as well (no paper costs to pay for). The power stays with the author, because the author is not a commodity.
Some publishers are worried that Amazon would get too much power if the Kindle succeeded. I think the power is going to continue to accrue to authors with direction connections to readers… that’s the real asset. Amazon doesn’t care which author sells, just as long assomethingsells.
What happens to reading habits when you can buy all the books youwant for $40 a month? What happens to book consumption when booksbecome social objects, commented upon by you and your participatingfriends or network? The conversations surrounding books are often a prime driver behind book sales (""You haven’t read it yet?) and the conversation-enabled Kindle takes that to a whole new level.
How does a classroom or corporate book circle or book group changewhen 20 or 50 people each spend a dollar or five dollars to engage in aspirited device-based/book-based discussion around a big idea?
6. As an author, I won’t write directly for the Kindle until it hasa big audience and it offers more than just a linear readingexperience. When that happens, though, when thousands of writers startusing this portal to reach millions of readers, it becomes a killerapp. Not until then, though.
A lot has been written about how cool the screen is. It is cool. Alot has been written about the offbeat interface (not so good) and the seamlessdownloading (a wonder.) This is all irrelevant to me. What’s worthcommenting on is how close the Kindle comes to revolutionizing the wayideas are sold and spread, and how short it comes out in the end (for now.) My bet is that thisis just round one. Round five could be/should be powerful indeed.","June 19, 2008","Kindle, reading habits, publishing industry"
The power of remarkable,"When I first wrote about Little Miss Matched about five years ago, they were an obscure little sock company, selling funky socks to fashionable girls.
The idea was beyond clever. 3 to a box, 133 styles, none of them match. Instead of a strategy built around a consultant’s vision of ‘utility’ or a strategy built around cheap or a strategy built around excessive retail distribution and heavy advertising, they built their strategy around one girl saying to another girl, ""wanna see my socks?""
I couldn’t have invented a better Purple Cow story if I had tried.
The company let me know today that they just did a huge deal with Macys and closed a $17 million funding with the folks who financed Build a Bear’s retail rollout. Money isn’t the only point, of course, but if that’s the way you keep score, that’s a long way for a little company to come in five years.

Superheroes,"As part of apromotionwe’re doing, I built a Squidoopageabout my friend Jacqueline.
It got me thinking about what it takes to make change, particularly change in the way markets respond. Markets are big and slow and often sort of dumb, so a memo isn’t going to be enough to make change happen.
As far as I can tell, there’s no demographic formula for determining who will make a difference. It doesn’t seem to matter where you were born, how much money your parents made or where you went to college. Sure, a head start in those areas makes it more likely that you’ll end up in a position of leverage. But it seems as though that isn’t enough.
Superheroes don’t have a look, but they definitely have an attitude. They’re restless and impatient,but,here’s the cool paradox, they’re also calm and patient. Patient because they realize that change takes a while. Patient because they understand that if it’s worth doing, it’s worth getting through the Dip. Impatient and restless, though, because they refuse to accept the status quo. Most of the time, of course, these can’t co-exist. Most of the time, the impatient flit. They don’t stick it out. Acumen just celebrated their seventh anniversary and this is the year traction is really kicking in.

What Dave just did,"Dave Balter, an old friend and colleague, has written a new book. It costs $45 on Amazon. But, for my loyal readers…you can get a copy of the ebook (the entire book) for freehere.
The way he is bringing his idea to the world is instructive.
First, he wrote a book. You should write a book, too. Publishing a bookis easier than it appears (in some ways, like the typing, typesetting,printing, and distributing part) but more difficult in others (like thewriting something worth reading part.) Writing a book forces you to beorganized and passionate and persuasive. Isn’t that worth trying?
Second, he rejected the idea of having a ‘real’ publisher publishit. A real publisher adds time (perhaps six months or a year or two)and limits many of your options re: pricing, distribution, royaltiesand promotion.
Third, he realized that the ideas in a book are different than thebook itself. The ideas are free. Dave made the ideas even easier toshare by putting them into a PDF. If you want the souvenir edition, theone you can hand to a friend or read on the beach or store on yourshelf, that costs a lot of money, but you don’t mind, because you’vealready decided you wanted one (no risk, cause you’ve read it!)
Fourth, he figured out a way to use scarcity to create promotion. Onthe day a book is released, it’s scarce. Scarce because no one has readit yet. That scarcity makes it more likely that someone will blog aboutit, because it’s a scoop. News. Cooler still, he’s not offering a copy of the book. Instead, he let me and a few other people offer it exclusively.
No, this doesn’t work if you haven’t worked with the blogger foryears, haven’t earned a reputation and most especially, haven’t writtensomething worth reading. In other words, it takes about six years ofhard work to become an overnight success. So, if you’re going to writea book in six years, please start now and focus on hard work, breakingnew ground and being a standup guy.
If you follow Dave’s tactics exactly, you’ll certainly fail (at least with me),because it’s already been done before. But, I have no doubt that variations on thismethod are going to get more and more powerful.

Silence is a virtue,"If the best thing you can think of is a bad pun, random capitalization and a weak photo (salt and pepper included!) it’s probably better to do nothing at all.
Nothing at all is actually the biggest difference between professional and amateur marketers. The pros are better at being quiet.

Authenticity and reality and intention,"Take a listen to this montage of three songs.
Listen to mp3
Any guesses as to what you just heard? Go ahead, I'll wait.
That's right, it's theSilver Beats, a group of four young men from Japan that have a serious Beatles Otaku. (One of John Lennon's original name for his group was the Silver Beetles.) They mimic each note, each cable, each instrument. I saw them in concert and it was uncanny.
Here's the thing: As far as I know, they don't speak English.
Does that change things? Does it make the song different when you know the singer has no idea what, ""I want to hold your hand,"" means? If every original Beatles song was replaced by an indistinguishable Silver Beats cover, would it matter? What about when a rich guy sings the blues? Or when a heartbreaker song is sung by a happily married man?
The popcorn videos I posted the other day have been seen around the web millions of times. It's now generally assumed that they arefake.Does that make them resonate differently for you?
What about the difference between Jerry Seinfeld (who writes his own material) and someone like David Letterman (who doesn't). Does it change your experience to know that?
How much marketing fakery do you willingly accept, and how much do you want to know about? Does the vegetarian really want to know that they didn't wash the pot at the restaurant and a few molecules of chicken broth are in that soup? How many molecules before it matters? Is it different if it's an accident? Why?
Marketers like to talk about transparency and authenticity. I think for most people, most of the time, we care a lot more about the effect and use of a product or service and less about who made it and why. We chose Converse because they get us a date, and we don't change brands just cause Nike owns them now.
Except for when we do. When we feel deceived or tricked, the game can change, and rapidly.
It's easier than ever to mount ornate hoaxes and fancy subterfuges. And you can get away with it for a while. But often, and at the worst possible moment, the market might change its mind. It might stop enjoying the fakery and switch to scorn and anger instead. I have no clue how to predict when this will happen. How much risk are you willing to take?","June 14, 2008","Authenticity, Fakery, Perception"
All customers are smarter than average,"In study after study, respondents rate themselves as less racist than average, smarter than average, more generous than average.
And though they are never asked, I’m pretty certain that your customers also believe that they are righter than average as well.
At the airport yesterday, a woman at security said to the TSA official, ""I’m a regular traveler, a frequent flyer and I know the rules. I want the fast line."" A moment later, it was determined that the woman had two huge bottles of shampoo in her very large carry on. ""No one told me that there was a restriction on liquids! Where does it say that?"" she snarled, as she stood in front of the sign that said that…

Unanswered (random) questions,"Now answered:
1. How did Economics get to be its own academic department? Surely, before Marx, it was part of the philosophy department, right? There are lots of fields that are subfields of something else (SEO, for instance, is part of ‘marketing’ and probably will be forever). Being your own department (in a company or a university) is a big deal. So, how exactly did it happen?
[Alan comes through withthis articleabout Alfred Marshall. His life’s work appeared to be creating Economics as a department-worthy science.]
2. What’s the deal with brown rice? How do people become so attached to the social implications of food that they are willing to starve or suffer from malnutrition rather than take a step backward? The price of rice has soared, yet it seems like people are still demanding white rice, instead of the more nutritious (and almost certainly cheaper) brown rice. How high does the price have to go before people make a different choice?
[Dustinwrites in with a great thought piece which concludes: ""I don’t know where the breaking point is. At some point in the starvation chain, of course, people will eat whatever’s put in front of them. Bugs, live rodents, even, yes, human flesh. But war, famine, environmental disaster, and other cataclysmic events have rarely been enough to cause anything more than a short, non-systemic turn to substitutes, even when a long-term switch might be better in dozens of ways. After all, we humans eat so that we can make meaning, not the other way around.""
To which I add: If people near starvation are willing to make choices based on self-esteem, I wonder what that says about those customers you think are focused only on the lowest price?]
3. Is there a web based service that permits the following: dozens or hundreds of people can participate in a live chat Q&A, probably with a moderator, along with a Skype-like audio function? Imagine how much cheaper and more effective large group conference calls could be. Skype limits conference calls to about 15, and it’s flaky at that size. This seems like an easy problem to solve extraordinarily well and even charge for…

Easter eggs and the Rick Roll,"Perhaps you haven’t heard of either term, but there’s no doubt you’ve seen or heard of both.
Aneaster eggis a hidden treasure, usually inside of a video game. For example, in an old version of the Mac, pressing certain keys brought up a picture of the Mac development team. In various games, you might find special levels, the names of various contributors or logos.
The magic of the easter egg is that it gives your most devoted users something to talk about. Hey, they say, try this… It demonstrates their insider status as well as making them feel generous when they share the knowledge.
Tom Bihn putoneon a piece of luggage, which became so popular it turned into a fundraising t-shirt.
You should think about rewarding your obsessed users with an easter egg.
And theRick Roll? You visit a YouTube video promising some sort of insight or riches or scandal, but instead, quite suddenly, you are confronted with an old music video instead.
The Rick Roll is perfect because two things happen:1. It shocks, at least a little bit. Not painful, but fun.2. You feel compelled to Rick Roll someone else. So it spreads.
For two days in a row, I’ve talked about outbound marketing that doesn’t feel like marketing. That’s because I want you to more broadly define what you need to do all day. If it touches the user, if it involves a story, if it’s part of the product, it’s marketing.",,"Easter eggs, Rick Roll, marketing"

The marketing of fear,"Fear is a powerful driver of decisions Without fear, no one would use seatbelts… you don’t use them because they’re fun, you use them because you worry about what would happen if you crashed without them.
The challenge of marketing with fear isn’t efficacy. Of course fear marketing works. The challenge is ethics and brand.
I got a note from Rob McGinley at Chubb Insurance today. Not a note, actually, but an official envelope, with the extra touch of bold red writing on the top of the official looking letter. Chubb, it turns out, is happy to sell me insurance against home invasion, carjacking, etc. The $110 a year includes coverage for psychiatric care and ""reward money leading to the apprehension of the perpetrator.""
I was incensed by this.
My clueless broker didn’t understand why. ""It’s just like flood insurance,"" he said. Actually, it’s not. It’s not because:1. Floods can be solved with money. Your house gets flooded, money can replace it.2. The odds of a flood are fairly significant, in the scheme of things.
Scaring people (scaring good customers) to make $100 is stupid. It hurts your brand. It makes it less likely they’ll open the envelope next time. And most of all, it’s wrong.
You can do it, no one can stop you. You shouldn’t do it, though, because you burn brand trust and you can’t get it back.
Why not sell shark attack insurance? After all, almost a handful of people died last year from shark attacks.

Urgent personal finance advice,"If I could only share one piece of personal finance advice to grads or to just about anyone, it would be this:
Only borrow money to pay for things that increase in value.
It’s a short list: your business, your house and your education, mostly. Stocks if you’re smarter than me. That’s pretty much it.
If you have credit card debt, you’re in big trouble. Your bank account has a huge leak in it, and it’s getting worse. Hence the urgency.
If you have credit card debt, that means that every time you spend money (even cash), you’re borrowing money to do so. And so, if you’re going out to dinner or buying a new pair of shoes, you’ve just broken the single most important rule of personal finance. You’re spending borrowed money on stuff that is decreasing in value.
This is an emergency. It’s an emergency because every single day you wait, the problem gets worse. A lot worse.
My suggestion: Go to defcon 1, and do it immediately. Shift gears to live well below your means. That means:No restaurantsNo clothes shoppingNo cable TV billNo Starbucks
It means:Take in a tenant in your spare bedroomCarpool to workSkip vacation this year
Eat brown rice and beans every night for dinner. Act like you have virtually no income.
The result? You’ll save $5,000 to $20,000 a year. Send all of it to the credit card company. Do this until you’re debt free, the faster the better.
There. Now you’re rich. Now you get interest on your savings instead of paying the bank. Twenty years from now, this emergency action will translate into perhaps a million dollars in the bank, depending on how much you earn and how serious you are.
You can thank me then.","June 9, 2008","personal finance, debt reduction, money management"
Vivid stories,"Like you, I’d heard scares about cell phones increasing the risk of brain cancer. While this is a scary story, it’s not so vivid. After all, it takes years to get brain cancer, there are countless factors involved and it’s impossible to test. It’s hard to visualize and easy to rationalize.
Popcorn, on the other hand, is a totally different story.

I’m just wondering… can you find a story this vivid for your product or service? Pass the bluetooth headset, please. [Won’t get fooled again? Stephen writes in and says the video is a hoax. And I found a video online of a repeat of the experiment that didn’t work. Snopes is silent on the matter, pointing out that eggs don’t cook, but nothing about popcorn.

The clowd,"So, very soon, you will own a cell phone that has a very good camera and knows where you are within ten or fifteen feet. And the web will know who you are and who your friends are.
What happens?
Well, when you take a photo, you can automatically send it to the clowd. The clowd can color correct and adjust the photo based on the million other photos it has seen just like this. [Debbie wonders, isn’t it called a ""cloud""? I guess I was subconsciously coining a new term–which I so rarely do–this time, combining crowd and cloud into something new. I think I like it, even if it is a bit artificial].
The clowd can figure out that this was the high school graduation (same time, same location), and realize that you were there with fifty of your closest friends, and automatically group the photos together… leaving out the people it’s obvious you don’t like.
The clowd can also find pictures taken of the same person, but by other people, and show them to you. Or cooler still, introduce you to those people. So, you take a picture of Keith Jarrett at Carnegie Hall and the clowd introduces you to other people who took his picture in ther places. (No, you shouldn’t have to tell the clowd it’s Keith, it should know. But yes, you will opt in to all of this… you ask before it takes these matchmaking liberties).
Wait. Alex suggests that this is the yearbook of the future. What an antiquity the yearbook we all own is. What happens when every student builds her own yearbook all year long? The clowd grabs your pictures, your friends’ pictures, pictures that the group has admired. It grabs the teachers you’ve written about, but leaves out the ones you’ve never interacted with. And everyone gets a different yearbook, of course.
PS your privacy is fairly shot. See a dangerous driver? Send a video snippet to the clowd. The clowd collates that with a bunch of other shots of the same driver… busted.
And the clowd also knows where you are, camera or no camera. So it can tell you when your old friend is just two gates away from you, also wasting time at the airport waiting for her flight. Or it can do Zagats to the ten thousandth power by not only suggesting the best nearby restaurant (based on your food circle of friends) but can also integrate with Open Table and only recommend restaurants that actually have room for you. Or it can let restaurant owners do yield management and find you a table at a good enough restaurant at the best possible price…
[And Dave points out that facial recognition lives in the clowd as well. Take a picture of someone and the clowd tells you who it is…]
This is going to happen. The only question is whether you are one of the people who will make it happen. I guess there’s an even bigger question: will we do it right?","June 7, 2008","clowd, privacy, facial recognition"

Doctors, of course, can rarely provide a cure. Neither can accountants or marketing consultants. But that’s what gets sold, cause that’s what people want to buy.

Email checklist,"Before you hit send on that next email, perhaps you should run down this list, just to be sure:",,"Email, checklist, sending"
Start with a classified,"Copy gets in the way.
Actually,thinkingabout copy gets in the way. You start writing and then you patch and layer and write and dissemble and defend and write and the next thing you know, you’ve killed it.
So, try this instead:
Write a classified ad. What’s the offer? What do you want me to do? You’re paying by the word!
""Lose weight now. Join our gym.""
Six words. Promise and offer.
Now, you can make it longer. Of course, if your gym is on the space station and it’s the only gym around, and if the people reading your ad are looking at the bulletin board and seeking out what they want, then your ad is now long enough.
But most of the time, in most settings, a little longer is better. So,add a few words or even a sentence. Is it better? More effective?Gently and carefully add words until it’s as effective as possible, butas short as possible.
Perhaps you want to make your promise more vivid, or more clear. Perhaps you need a testimonial or two to back up your promise. Perhaps your call to action needs to be more urgent… You can play with all of that, keeping in mind the original classified, keeping in mind that you’re still paying by the word (because attention is expensive).
And yes, this applies to articles in the newspaper, to blog posts, to how-to books and to direct marketing letters. It applies to the emails you send and the copy on your website too.","June 4, 2008","copywriting, classified ads, brevity"
Not so grand,"Grand openings are severely overrated. So are product launches and galas of all sorts.
Make a list of successful products in your industry. Most of them didn’t start big. Not the Honda Accord or Facebook, not Aetna Insurance, not JetBlue or that church down the street. Most overnight successes take a decade (okay, four years online).
The grand opening is a symptom of the real problem… the limited attention span of marketers. Marketers get focused (briefly) on the grand opening and then move on to the next thing (quickly). Grand opening syndrome forces marketers to spend their time and money at exactly the wrong time, and worse, it leads to a lack of patience that damages the prospects of the product and service being launched.
Non-profits do the same thing when they spend months planning an elaborate gala that takes all the time and enriches the hotel and the caterer. Far better to spend the time and money building actual relationships than going for the big ‘grand’ hit.
The best time to promote something is after it has raving fans, after you’ve discovered that it works, after it has a groundswell of support. And more important, the best way to promote something is consistently and persistently and for a long time. Save the bunting for Flag Day.","June 3, 2008","Marketing, Grand Openings, Patience"
Do you own trees?,"Today’s New York Timesreportsan astonishing fact: Book publishers wholesale their ebooks to Amazon for precisely the same price as their paper books. Amazon loses money on every ebook for the Kindle they sell because publishers don’t discount zero-cost ebooks.
Apparently, the publishers don’t count the paper, storage, inventory, shredding and shipping expenses in their cost calculations.
Either that, or they own a tree plantation or a printing plant.
And of course, they own neither.
Many businesses act as if they have a stake in their suppliers and other vendors. Instead of scaling the part of their business that can move quickly and well, they defend the part they don’t even own.
Jasonwrote in to ask why I thought that the newspaper industry was in a Dip. In my book, I point out that with classified ads disappearing and the web thriving, the days of newspapers as we know them are clearly over. That shouldn’t mean the industry is in trouble. In fact, there are more people reading more news every day than ever before–without the cost of printing and distributing a costly piece of newsprint every day. Happy days…
But (many of) the people in the industry have built their lives around the trees. As a result, the industry is over. A new industry is being built in its place, often with new people doing work that might be done far better by the old hands, the ones who are stuck defending the wholesale slaughter of trees.
If you think your job is to keep the printers busy, then you see the world differently. You focus on per issue sales, you worry about people sharing a paper (!), you don’t count online readers as valuable (even though they’remorevaluable). You focus on one edition, not a thousand different versions. You focus on having one front page, not dozens based on who is reading.
If you work for a newspaper that feels this way, every day you stay is a day wasted.
I worry about my esteemed friends in the book publishing industry as well. The amazing thing about theTimesstory today was the report that the mood at BEA was ‘unease’ about ebooks. The fastest-growing, lowest cost segment of the business, the one that offers the most promise, the best possible outcome and has the best results… is causing unease! All because of the trees.
Of course, there are trees in your business too. There are trees in the photography business (chemicals) and in the music business (plastic) and even in the personal computer business (computers). They may not be called trees, but they’re there.","June 2, 2008","ebooks, publishing industry, sustainability"

Should you fire the voice mail guy?,"Let’s say the person in charge of your retail operations does the following every single day:
Maybe, just maybe, after a day or two of this, and a few warnings, you’d realize that this person was doing serious damage to your organization, no?
I called a company yesterday, one that promises 24 hour a day response. I worked my way through four levels of voice mail choices, then got a recording, ""Please call back during our regular business hours."" Then it hung up. No mention of when regular business hours were, and no indication four levels back that they were closed but automated help was available.
And I’m guessing the voice mail system has been doing this every single day for months or years. Who is in charge of this? Why do they still work there? If the person in charge were stealing laptops or peeing in the soup, it’s unlikely he’d still be around, no?
It’s pretty obvious: the CEO would notice the angry crowds in front of the store, she’d notice the police being called and the riot out front if the person in charge of the front doors was such a jester. But voice mail trees are invisible and the CEO doesn’t notice them. She should. You have my permission to call your company and see what happens. If you’re not proud of it, let the CEO know. If this isn’t your biggest marketing emergency, I’m not sure what is. Invisible doesn’t mean unimportant.",,"voice mail, customer service, organizational issues"
My tooth doesn’t hurt,"That’s not something you think about very often, is it? (Notmytooth, your tooth).
When you have a toothache, on the other hand, it’s all you think about.
This is a double-edged sword for dentists. On one hand, dentists have no trouble whatsoever getting business from people with toothaches. They hardly have to try. Just show up, I’ll find you. On the other hand, when my teeth don’t hurt, you’re invisible. No amount of signs, service and wonderful marketing is going to get me to pay you to drill my teeth when they don’t hurt.
There are two challenges for toothache marketers (dentists and non-dentists alike).
1. Figure out a cost-effective way to be there. A way to gently be in my face so that when my toothache shows up (in whatever form that takes) you’re the obvious choice.
2. Create new products and services that build engagement and possibly revenue among members of the population that aren’t in pain. That, of course, is why teeth whitening services are so smart. You can sell to people who didn’t know they had a problem until they met you.
The worst thing you can do is get frustrated when the population (which is very different from the market) ignores you. I’m not in your target market until my teeth hurt, right?

The TV dividend,"Where did Wikipedia come from?
All those hours, all that work. Where did the time and effort come from?
Clay Shirkypoints out that it comes from the TV we’re not watching.
Take a look atNetroidcomics, courtesy of Bert. Sure, some of these folks were at work, goofing off, but the real influx of time and energy we’re seeing online comes from TV. Three, four or even six hours a day not spent doing virtually nothing. Multiply it by 800 million people online and suddenly, there’s a huge influx of hours just waiting to be put to good use.
I don’t watch TV and I don’t go to meetings. You’d be amazed at the difference it makes.

Are you in the tribe?,"[LAST UPDATE: As of 9 am NY time on August 10th, invites are closed. Please don’t respond, because unfortunately, we’ll have to say no.].
I’d like to invite you to join a members-only tribe. A tribe for marketers, for leaders, for those focused on building communities or creating products or spreading ideas.
This online community will live on a site we’ve created that will feature blogs, forums, social networking, comments, photos, videos and a job board. And it’s by invitation only until October. Spots are limited and early members get privileges and bragging rights.
Members get a password and the privilege of meeting each other, posting thoughts, connecting to big ideas or projects and more. The site will include excerpts from the book as well as a chance to contribute to a new jointly-authored ebook, with full credit and links to the contributors. The contents of the tribe forum won’t be posted to the public until October, so it’s really the only way to participate until then.
I’m launching my new book in mid-October, and as usual, doing something different to take my own advice.
One of the ideas I talk about briefly in the book is that powerful tribes aren’t open to everyone. The exclusivity makes it work. In this case, the exclusivity comes from two things:
1. I’m only announcing the Tribe here on my blog. (Though it would be great with me if you want invite your friends to join, because your friends are my friends and they’ll probably appreciate an early invite).
2. You have to be committed enough to pre-order my book, sight unseen (in some places for less than $14), months in advance. It’s not about selling more books, of course, it’s about creating a small hurdle to get the right people in the door.
The mechanics:
Members of the tribe will get a chance to win free tickets to my launch event/presentation in New York as well as a few other goodies.
Even with just a few people in the pre-beta tribe we’ve built, I can already see how powerful it can be to have a safe, well-lit place on line where like-minded people can connect. I hope you can join us.

"Marilyn Monroe, the Mona Lisa and Jackson Pollock","Markets love icons. We seek them out. Placeholders, shorthand for a bigger idea or a shortcut to a good enough solution.
Marilyn Monroe is an icon. You can use her image and say a lot, instantly. Same with the Mona Lisa.
Is it possible to be more of a blonde bombshell than Monroe? Of course you can be better looking or more blonde or more married to intellectual celebrities or dour sports stars. Is it possible to paint a better painting than the Mona Lisa? Definitely.
It doesn’t matter.
Once there’s an icon in place, it’s there because it’s working. It serves a purpose, it carries useful information and performs a valuable function. There will never (or not for a generation, anyway) be the next Marilyn Monroe because this Marilyn Monroe isn’t broken. Countless artists have seen themselves as the next Jackson Pollock, but as far as the lay public is concerned, we don’t really need one, thanks very much.
Google, of course, is the Marilyn Monroe of search. I have no doubt that someone will develop a useful tool one day that takes time and attention away from Google, but it won’t be a search engine. Google, after all, isn’t broken, not in terms of solving the iconic ""how do I find something online using my web browser"" question.
The challenge for organizations is this: the easiest projects to start and fund are those that go after existing icons. The search for the ""next"" is easy to explain and exciting to join because we can visualize the benefits. But success keeps going to people who build new icons, not to those that seek to replace the most successful existing ones.","July 28, 2008","Icons, Success, Innovation"
Promoting the promotion,"Rounding a corner, I saw a billboard for baseball’s Home Run Derby, a sideshow attraction at the All Star Game.
Turns out that the billboard was paid for by State Farm Insurance, also the sponsor of the Derby itself.
This is how far we’ve come, how low we’ve sunk.
An insurance company is sponsoring a baseball stunt to push its brand name out there. And then, with nothing whatsoever to say about itself, or about us, or about how it can help us achieve our goals, the company spends more money to promote the promotion.
Promotions work when they’re seen as generous or unique or tied into our needs and dreams. They also work as brand builders when they’re so ubiquitous we associate the brand with the event itself. But if I had written ""Allstate"" instead of ""State Farm,"" would you have realized the error? Doubtful.

"I need to build a house, what kind of hammer should I buy?","I want to write a novel. What word processor do you recommend?
Yesterday on the radio, Jimmy Wales was talking about the Wikipedia movement. A caller who identified himself as a strategist at Amnesty International asked: We’re going to build a website to promote freedom and democracy and human rights. What software should we use?
Really.
If you want to do something worth doing, you’ll need two things: passion and architecture. The tools will take care of themselves. (Knowledge of tools matters, of course, but it pales in comparison to the other two.)
Sure, picking the wrong tools will really cripple your launch. Picking the wrong software (or the wrong hammer) is a hassle. But nothing great gets built just because you have the right tools.

Bait and switch,"I feel bad for the airline industry. They are caught in a never-ending price war due to online websites and their own commodification. Pick the cheapest flight to get from here to there…
The natural short-term solution is bait and switch. Advertise the lowest price you can imagine and then require add on fees so you can actually make a profit.
Air Canada, which my readers generally concur is the single worst major airline in North America, has a fascinating policy. No oversized duffel bags, regardless of weight,unlessthey contain hockey gear. No shin guards, you pay $80 a bag.
Of course, you can have whatever rules you want, even if they’re only designed to help defensemen. The problems with bait and switch are:
As I said, this is a short-term strategy. Yesterday, they charged me $160 for two bags that had successfully gone through their system uncharged just three weeks earlier. And they did it only three minutes before four of my fellow travelers (and friends) checked virtually identical bags for free.
But the purpose of this rant isn’t to hassle Air Canada. The purpose is to learn a key lesson from Disney:When there is both pain and pleasure associated with your service, work extremely hard to separate them by time and geography.
Disney charges a fortune for the theme park, but they do it a week before you get there, or at a booth far far away from the rides. By the time you get to the rides, you’re over it. The pain isn’t associated with the fun part.
Airlines, on the other hand, surround the very thing they sell (getting you home) with armed guards, untrained TSA agents, long lines and sneering gate agents eager to take your money when you have absolutely no expectation or choice and when your stress is at its highest. This is a problem in the long run.","July 24, 2008","Bait and switch, airline industry, pricing strategy"

How (not to) pick a company spokesman,"39 years ago, Neil Armstrong became the most famous person in the world.
He was an astronaut, of course, but there were dozens of people who could have done the technical work that Armstrong did. What Armstrong became was a spokesperson for an organization, a nation and a movement.
NASA did what many organizations do when picking someone to act as company spokesperson. They avoided risk, played it safe and chose someone who wouldn’t make a ruckus.
What a shame.
Armstrong could have taught the world about science. He could have done work that would have won him a Nobel Peace Prize. He could have had a huge impact on his country and the world. Instead, he mostly disappeared.
Many organizations worry that if they put their clout behind an individual, he or she will gain notoriety and power and eventually double-cross the organization. So, instead, they go for bland.
As marketers, you already see the problem. It’s like putting a tennis ball on the end of your sword. Sooner or later, people communicate with people. Sooner or later, your organization needs a voice. You take lots of risks when you market a product, and this one–the risk of an engaging and motivated spokesperson–is smarter than most.",,"spokesperson, risk, marketing"
Are they ready to listen?,"Most marketers forget to ask this critical question.
When I was pitching for investors in Yoyodyne (1994/1995) I met with many of the biggest VCs on the East Coast. Same company, same pitch, very different results.
In retrospect, the reason was simple, and it didn’t have a lot to do with the way I presented our company. Firms that had funded Federal Express and insurance companies and patented chemical formulations weren’t ready to hear about an Internet company in 1994. It didn’t matter what I said, they had decided before I showed up. Fred Wilson and Jerry Colonna, on the other hand, had a different worldview. They were choosing to pay attention.
A few years before that, I had published a book about a political issue. An activist’s handbook. I had 20,000 copies in my garage when I found out about a large march in Washington. I bought an outdoor booth and trucked the books down to DC. I stood on the Mall in my little booth and watched more than 250,000 people walk by in less than two hours. Every single one an activist. Every single one a demographically perfect match for my handbook. After 100,000 people had walked by and we’d sold only one book, I lowered the price from around $10 to $1 just to prove my point–that it wasn’t the book and it wasn’t the price, it was the ability of the audience to listen that mattered. This group, in this moment, was there to march, not to shop.
Most people, most of the time, steadfastly refuse to pay attention.
The tragic mistake of demographics and media planning is that they overlook the single most important issue: is the person you’re talking to ready to listen?","July 22, 2008","audience, attention, marketing"
The web doesn’t care,"When I first started talking about Permission Marketing ten years ago, marketers asked, ""sure, but how does this helpus?""
A decade later, marketers look at Wikipedia or social media or the long tail or whatever trend is finally hitting them in the face and ask the same question.
Here’s the essential truth:
This is the first mass marketing medium ever that isn’t supported by ads.
If a newspaper, a radio station or a TV station doesn’t please advertisers, it disappears. It exists to make you (the marketer) happy.
That’s the reason the medium (and its rules) exist. To please the advertisers.
But the Net is different.
It wasn’t invented by business people, and it doesn’t exist to help your company make money.
It’s entirely possible it could be used that way, but it doesn’t owe you anything. The question to ask isn’t, ""but how does this help me?"" as if you have some sort of say in the matter. You don’t get a vote on whether Google succeeds or whether your customers erect spam filters.
The question to ask is, ""how are people (the people I need to reach, interact with and tell stories to) going to use this new power and how can I help them achieve their goals?""","July 21, 2008","Permission Marketing, Digital Medium, Consumer Empowerment"

The problem with this, that and the other thing is that you end up with a career filled with it. Instead of creating long-lasting art, ideas that matter and things that spread organically, you end up with a bunch of calculated mini-hits.

The Long Tail and the Dip,"
When you launch a new product or service, you have a choice.
It’s tempting to go for the bestseller list, to create a mass market hit. This is the box labeled 1 on the tail above. Everyone wants to be here. It’s where ego meets profit. A home run. Pixar lives in box 1.
In order to have a bestseller, you must reach theunreachable. Most of the people who buy a bestselling book buy no other book that month, or even that year. The very nature of the top of the list is that you’re reaching not just the frequent purchasers and the passionate, but those that only show up for the hits.
The second pocket is labeled, conveniently, #2 (not because it’s second best, merely because it’s the second one I’m mentioning). This is the profitable, successful niche product. Roger Corman’s horror movies, say, or Vandersteen’s $3,000 stereo speakers. Not a product for everyone, certainly, but among those that care and are choosing to pay attention, a fantastic choice.
The reason you can make money in the niche pocket is that it costs far less to compete here. First, because there’s less competition and the competition is less fierce, and second because it’s cheaper and easier to reach your target market because they’re choosing to pay attention.
There’s a spectacular amount of overhead associated with a mass market hit. You need to buy shelf space and hype and promotion and noise in order to momentarily have a shot at stardom. If you don’t push your way into this arena, you’ll be ignored.
The third pocket is to own the long tail, to make a small royalty on a huge range of products. That’sCDbabyand iTunes and the Garrett Wade tool catalog.
AndThe Dip? The Dip really kicks in when you’re comparing the first pocket to the second.
If you want to compete with all of those folks shortsighted enough to shoot for the big win, you need to invest a great deal of time and money. And very few make it through the Dip… there are far more movies like Speed Racer than Iron Man. Speed Racer got stuck in the trough. It wasn’t the best in the world, it wasn’t the one the masses chose to see, it lost. Hundreds of millions of dollars spent, but not enough time or talent invested to get through the Dip.
When the masses went to see a movie in June of 08, they had a choice. Naturally, they chose to see the movie that was the best available, the one they wanted to see the most. If you’re the third best choice, you lose.
The alternative? The makers of Speed Racer could have spent less money and made a movie aimed at pocket 2, a niche movie where they could have easily made it through the Dip, easily overwhelmed competition for that niche, easily become the best inthatworld.
Bruce Lee wasn’t the best movie star in history. But he was the best kung fu star in history. Different dip.
The most common misconception about Long Tail thinking is that if you don’t succeed at pocket 1, don’t worry, because the tail will take care of your product and you’ll just end up in #2. That’s not true. #2 isn’t a consolation prize for mass market losers. Mass market losers are still losers. In order to become a mass market star you make choices about features and pricing and quality–and if you lose that game, there’s no reason to believe that those choices are going to pay off for a different market.
The long tail doesn’t offer a consolation prize. Instead, the wide selection (in every market, not just digital ones) is a collection of smaller long tails, each with its own dip, each with its own winners (and losers). Pick the biggest market you can successfully dominate, the biggest slice where you can get through the Dip and be seen as the best in that world.","July 18, 2008","Long Tail, Niche Market, The Dip"
There it is again,"Chris Anderson of Wired had the insight and guts to discover one of the two most important natural laws of the Net, give it a name, explain it and teach it to the rest of us.The Long Tailis a natural law, the sort of thing that just keeps showing up. Every time I crunch a set of numbers, every time I examine something happening online, I see it again.
(The other one? Metcalfe’s Law, which explains the network effect. It’s sort of like the long tail, but flipped in the mirror. The more people who connect to a network, the more it’s worth–squared. Facebook and fax machines are both network effect businesses).
A lot of people don’t seem to understand a key implication of the long tail: Given the choice, it’s better to make a hit.
If you have a choice of cutting a top 10 record or making a track of Jamaican polka music for iTunes, go for the hit.
If you have a choice between being on page 30 of the Google results for ""Bolivian sushi"" or the number one match for ""buy life insurance"", go for the latter. No brainer.
The problem, of course, is that you don’t have a choice. You can give the hit a shot, but it’s awfully crowded at that end of the curve.
The implications of the long tail have nothing to do with this false choice. What it explains in a powerful but subtle way is:
Aside: In the last few weeks, I’ve gotten a ton of email about an article in the Harvard Business Review and a companion slash piece in Slate about the Tail. A professor tried to poke some holes, and in my opinion, missed the entire point. The long tail is so clearly a force that the real work is in refining the definitions and expectations of those that are affected by it.","July 17, 2008","Long Tail, network effect, digital economy"
If you don’t want to get email,"…don’t send email.

If you send a note to 100 or 1000 customers/clients/prospects/shippers/parents (whatever), be sure to give people a way to reply! I think this is especially important for small organizations or small subsets of lists… Amazon and eBay and others get a bit of a pass.
If it’s important enough for you to send to me, it may be important enough for me to write back.
I know it’s horribly expensive and inconvenient to work your way through the replies, but aren’t the replies exactly what you need to see? What an opportunity.
Email is medium all onto itself. It’s the only medium where the human voice appears the same whether it’s ‘live’ or ‘recorded’ and where there’s an expectation that all interactions are two-way.
Here’s what you do:
1. Send the email to your permission list, an announcement that’s anticipated, personal and relevant.
2. Set up a ""reply to"" that’s a different address.
3. In the email, at the bottom, give people a web address where they can go to give feedback, or give them an email they can write to that will be read by a real person.
4. If they hit reply, the replyto will automatically send the note to the right person.","July 16, 2008","email communication, two-way interaction, customer feedback"

Should small businesses whine?,"I bought some clothes from a merchant via Amazon. The company that I ordered from shipped the wrong item. I sent it back and was told it will take three or four weeks to process my return. A month!
I wrote back, asking why it would take so long. The response, ""Thank you for your inquiry. To answer your question we are NOT an big company like Amazon we are actually a small company, That is why it does take us a little longer than others.""
Of course, you’d think a small company could be faster. More important, you’d think the company would realize that I couldn’t care a whit about how small they are… I just want good service.
If your small company can’t deliver a better experience (in areas people care about) than a big one, why on Earth should someone do business with you? I’m not saying you must have faster service, a bigger website, lower pricesandtwenty-four hour a day phone support. I’m saying that for some of your customers, you have to be monstrously, demonstrably, better.
The web is a great equalizer. A tiny business can have a betterwebsitethan a huge one. A tiny business can do bettercustomer supportthan a big one. A tiny business can write a betternewsletterthan a big one. Maybe not for everyone, but everyone is for the big companies. The passionate minority is happy to embrace the small company.

Scarcity,"One day, you may be lucky enough to have a scarcity problem. A product or a service or even a job that’s in such high demand that people are clamoring for more than you can make.
We can learn a lot from the abysmal performance of Apple this weekend. They took a hot product and totally botched the launch because of a misunderstanding of the benefits and uses of scarcity.
First, understand that scarcity is a choice. If you raise your price, scarcity goes away. If your product is going to be scarce, it’s either because you benefit from that or because your organization is forbidden to use price as a demand-adjustment tool. I’m going to assume the former. (But I riff a bit on the latter toward the end)
Why be scarce?
The danger is that you can kill long-term loyalty. You can annoy your best customers. You can spread negative word of mouth. You can train people to hate your scarcity strategy (Apple did all four this weekend).
Take a look at the guy in the photo. That’s the goal. He feels great. He’s a hero, at least for a moment, all because he stood in line all night. He gets to talk about it and others (not everyone, but enough) aspire to be him next time. You reward the tribe and you build the tribe at the same time.
The problem is that our kneejerk way of dealing with scarcity is to treat everyone the same and to have people ‘pay’ by spending time to indicate their desire.
Waiting in line is a very old-school way of dealing with scarcity. And treating new customers like old customers, treating unknown customers the same as high-value customers is painful and unnecessary.
Principle 1:Use the internet to form a queue. If you have a scarce product, you almost certainly know it’s scarce in advance. Instead of taxing customers by wasting their time, reward the early shoppers by taking orders online. A month before sale date, for example, tell them it’s coming. If you sell out before ship date, that’s great, because next time people will be even quicker to order when they hear about what you’ve got. (And you can do this in the real world, too–postcards with numbers or even playing cards work just fine.)
A hot band that regularly sells out on the road, for example, could puta VIP serial number inside every CD or t-shirt they sell. Use that topre-order your tix.
Principle 2:Give the early adopters a reward. In the case of Apple, I would have made the first 100,000 phones a different color. Then, instead of the buyer being a hero for ten seconds, he gets to be a hero for a year.
Principle 3:Treat different customers differently. Apple, for example, knows how to contact every single existing customer. Why not offer VIP status to big spenders? Or to those that make a lot of calls? Let them cut the line. It’s not fair? What’s fair mean? I can’t think of anything more fair than treating the people who treat you well, better.
Principle 4:When things happen in real time, you’re way more likely to screw up. One of the giant advantages of the Net is that you can fix things before the whole world notices. Try to do your rollout in small sections, so you can fix mistakes before you hurt the very people you’re trying to embrace.
Principle 5:Give your early adopters a forum to celebrate. A place to brag or demonstrate or show off or share insights and ideas. Amplify the heroes, which is far better than amplifying the pain of standing in line.
Imagine what the Apple and AT&T stores would have been like this weekend if they were filled with happy customers who had pre-paid, pre-registered and were just dropping in for three minutes to pick up their (very coveted) phones, walking up the VIP line, past all the others just waiting for a chance to buy one…
Hotrestaurants in New York violate all five of these principles on a regular basis. So do sports teams and stores that have lines out front in the middle of winter. What a waste.
Even colleges do it. They pretend they’ve got a meritocracy, but in practice, it’s a high-pressure lottery with enormous financial and stress overhead involved.
Yes, there are times when scarcity is mandated (the TSA at airports, for example, or food rations at an emergency site). I know that there are plenty of ways to deal with this scarcity as well. Ways to treat your customers (and yes, they are customers) with more respect, to communicate the situation more clearly and to architect the environment so that people are grateful, not stressed out.
Smart marketers understand that scarcity (intentional or not) is a tool, one that can be used to enhance the story, not detract from it.","July 13, 2008","Scarcity, Customer Experience, Marketing Strategy"
What do you do when your systems break?,"If you want to enrage customers, just sit idle while they rage against a broken system at your organization.
Someone shipped me a package from Indiana more than two weeks ago. UPS shipped it to my old address, mis-sorted it, shipped it back to Indiana, mis-sorted it before returning it, shipped it back to NY, mis-sorted it, shipped it back to Indiana, mis-sorted it, shipped it back to NY (I’m not making this up and I’m not exaggerating) and yes, it’s now on it’s way back to Indiana. Maybe.
There have been a dozen phone calls by the shipper and myself to UPS. And every time, the agent and the supervisor insist that there is nothing they can do and that all the correct buttons have been pushed. When pressed, they acknowledge that something appears broken, but ""my hands are tied.""
Stuff happens in every organization that has a system. You can’t eliminate it. The question is: what do your people do when they see ‘broken.’ What do you encourage/permit them to do?

Bar graphs vs. Pie charts,"Compare!
The bar graph is read left to right and seems to imply something about the declining relevance of Billygoats (even though close inspection shows that we expect high growth in billygoats next year). There’s data here, but no information.
The pie chart contains far less data, but the point is obvious: Trolls are where we should focus our energy.
That’s why you use it. It makes an obvious point and leaves no real room for discussion. I think discussions are great, but that’s not why you are doing a presentation.
I stepped on the toes of many data presentation purists yesterday, so let me reiterate my point to make it crystal clear: In a presentation to non-scientists (or to bored scientists), the purpose of a chart or graph is to make one point, vividly. Tell a story and move on. If you can’t be both vivid and truthful, it doesn’t belong in your presentation. (I can think of dozens of good uses of bar graphs… they’re not forbidden, they’re just overused and misused).

",,"data visualization, bar graphs, pie charts"
The three laws of great graphs,"If you use graphs in your Powerpoint presentations, I hope you’ll follow these three simple principles.
1. One Story2. No Bar Charts3. Motion
ONE STORYThe only reason (did I mention only) to use a chart in a presentation is to make a point. If you want to prove some deep insight or give people textured data to draw their own conclusions, DON’T put it in a presentation. Put it in a handout. Give them a URL with a spreadsheet at the other end.
No, the reason you put a chart in a presentation is to tell a story. A single story, one story per chart. ""Oh,"" the attendee says, ""our costs are going through the roof!"" Or, in the case of the picture here, ""Oh boy LA and Florida are in big big trouble.""
There is no room for nuance here. You don’t have nuance in the other parts of your presentation, and it doesn’t belong here.
If the facts demand nuance, don’t use a graph, because you won’t get nuance, you’ll get confusion.
NO BAR CHARTSBar charts are dramatically overrated, primarily because they’re the first choice in many graphing programs.
The problem with bar charts is that they should either be line/area charts (when graphing a change over time, like unemployment rates) or they should be a simple pie chart (when comparing two or three items at the same scale).
[I know full well that pie charts are not rigorous and often misused. My point is that if you need to show slight differences or many bits of data, you probably don’t want a chart at all.]
The correct use of a bar chart is to show how several items change over a period of time. This, of course, demands nuance.
MOTIONHere’s the surprising one: You should animate your charts.
It’s simple: create two slides. The first one shows where the data used to be, the second one, on the same axes, shows where it is or where it’s going. Motion.
Establish the first slide. Make your point about your source and its validity. Then press the advance button. Boom.

Wikipedia gets fictional,"The biography ofGeorge Costanzais five times as long as that ofTim O’Reilly.
As Wikipedia matures, there are hard decisions to be made about depth and breadth. Shouldn’t Tim’s entry be many pages long? He’s one of the great thinkers of our time. If IBM andJones Sodaget entries, why not your brand (or my oldsummer camp, which was ruthlessly deleted)?
Most serious web users realize that Wikipedia can be edited by anyone. Above the echelon of casual editors are more serious volunteers who set standards, delete articles and argue with each other about what belongs and what doesn’t. There’s an entire cadre of deletionists who want fewer articles of higher quality, while there are others that would choose to embrace the long tail and create a freeer environment. The seeswaw arguments make for entertaining discussion but it can be hard to predict what will happen on any given day.
SEO rewards Wikipedia, and well it should. Most searchers who end up there are pretty happy with that result. But as we get further and further into Googleworld, who decides what’s worthy?
A consistent rule on Wikipedia has been to rely on edited print publications (the mainstream media) as well as physical or unchanging materials (like the DVD of a TV show). This made sense five years ago, but as the world abandons print reference (which Wikipedia largely relies on for verification), are we biasing the entries in favor of Abraham Lincoln (plenty of printed facts available) and TV series characters (we canprovethat George worked for Vandalay Industries)?
Another rule has been a taboo on self-promotion (which is smart), but it runs headlong into the issue of completeness and relevance. If you know or like Tim (or me or your company), you’re more likely to invest the effort to write about him. And you’re certainly more likely to have access to the interesting and relevant facts. This rule gets bent all the time, but again, it’s rarely made crystal clear.

If your goal is to be invited to a parade, it sure helps to be in a marching band. Your chiropractic firm might, just might, be invited to be the grand marshal or something, but in general, it helps to be in a parade-friendly line of work.
Well, just like parades for July 4th or Flag Day, there’s a luck parade. And some organizations are just better suited for this opportunity than others. If your business plan includes the phrase, ""and then we luck out,"" or ""and then we become fashionable"" or ""and then the market embraces this idea,"" I sure hope you’re organized for that.
There used to be a luck parade in Hollywood, but then too many people showed up and the odds plummeted. A few years ago, there was a luck parade in Silicon Valley, because Sand Hill Road was so eager to hand out venture funding. Today, good fortune seems to be smiling on quirky visions and those willing to self-publish.

Two simple web businesses,"The world needs fixed-price web podiatrists.
Podiatrists, not doctors.
Doctors do surgery and prescribe expensive drugs and stuff. Podiatrists can just make it easier to get around.
So, a pretty smart web-savvy person could have a checklist of fifty items and work her way through a corporate website. She could come back with a simple, easy to execute list of things worth changing:–put USA above Afghanistan on your country pull down list–make it so clicking on your logo takes me back to your home page–the font is too small on this page and it’s hard to readetc.
Low hanging fruit, stuff that doesn’t need approval from the CEO to fix. Maddening idiosyncracies, worth the few minutes it takes to fix them.
Second gig: Web analytics pro. Someone who can, for a generous hourly fee, set up analytics for a website and do weekly reports (by email) that are actually useful and actionable.
$200 an hour is totally reasonable for work like this. It’s worth ten times that when it’s done right. We’re talking about optimizing an AdWords campaign that returns millions of dollars in profit.
Of course there are people who already know how to do this. The question is: can it be marketed as an easy thing, a simple sale, a matter of course…

Who vs. how many,"Scoblehas a great post about a 14 year old kid with 45 million viewers on YouTube.

And what about your ads? Are you busy sponsoring sites that have less traffic than he does? Sure you are. Why? I thought it was all about reaching the masses…

"The statesman, the lawyer and the marketer","There aren’t so many statesmen. People who speak truth to power. Leaders who describe what they see, whether or not it serves their short-term interests. They say what needs to be said, do what needs to be done, as long as it serves the long-term needs of their constituents. No wonder we like them so much.
Lawyers are sworn to be advocates. It’s their duty. They take a side and they argue it. They’re not supposed to tell the truth, they’re supposed to argue a point of view.
Guess who has a better reputation?
Which leads us to marketers. Have you noticed that most of us act like lawyers?
Perhaps, just perhaps, someone would be better off with a competitor’s product instead of yours. Or perhaps the world doesn’t really need what your factory just rolled out. If you’re a lobbyist, it’s hard to act like a statesman and keep your job. Or if you’re a pharmaceutical sales rep. Or a PR firm. Or a brand manager at a software company.
Marketing culture has become a culture of lawyers. Apparently, marketers are now advocates sworn to argue on behalf of a client.
This attitude leads to spam (hey, it’s not against the law and it helps my client) and to dicey product claims and to awful side effects like obesity, shoddy products and massive debt. If your job is to represent a product and ensure its short-term sales, that’s exactly what you’re sworn to do.
I believe that anyone, regardless of situation, deserves the best possible lawyer. Our advocacy-based justice system depends on it. Butdoes every product, service and organization deserve the best possible marketer?
What happens when marketers stop arguing on behalf of their corporate or organizational client and start arguing on behalf of the customer instead? What happens when marketers become statesmen?
This is a very practical hypothetical question I’m asking.
When a sales rep says, ""You know, after hearing your situation, I think you’d be a lot better off with my competitor’s product instead, here’s her number,"" it actually creates positive word of mouth and long-term growth. When a brand manager says to the product development people, ""I’m not proud of this design, we’re not going to market it, so you better make something else,"" it actually creates market share growth. And when a CEO says to Congress, ""Our industry relies on chemical X and we’re going to keep using it as long as our competitors do, so please ban it,"" she creates a long-term path to stability and growth.
The lawyer works with constituents who fully expect him to be an advocate. The judge, the clients and the jury (hopefully) understand that he is making a case, not telling the truth.
Marketers work in a different world. As marketing has transformed from a specialized subset of business to a ubiquitous element of society, marketers still have the chance to be believed. But trust belongs to statesmen, not lawyers. People don’t say, ""I trust her, she’s the lawyer for the other side.""
The real question, I guess, is this: who’s your client?","July 2, 2008","statesman, marketer, advocacy"

The uncanny valley,"Tom points us to thisfascinating concept. It’s called the uncanny valley and it goes back as far as Freud.
When you get too good at faking it, people freak out.
We love cute dogs, cute monkeys, clairvoyant websites, smart voice mail systems.
But we get totally wigged out when a website knows too much about us, when we start talking to a voice mail attendant like she’s a real person or when a photo or a robot is just too good. A magician is fine, an actual mind reader we burn at the stake.
The relevant issue here for marketers is what happens when our databases and predictions get too good. I don’t want the hotel to automatically serve me the same breakfast as last trip, or for the doorman to pretend he’s my friend just because he read a database entry.

Why cartoons work,"Tom Fishburnehas a new bookout, and you should take a look if you’re seeking a new way tothink about marketing, your brand, or your colleagues. The whole tour ishere.
Andrew Kaufman’s bookdoes the same thing, but in a totally different way–with text that has the same power of a great cartoon. Thanks, Andrea, for sending it to me… I loved every word of it.
Cartoons work because they’re not monologues. Even though the mediumis one-directional, a dialogue takes place. In between the panels, inbetween the talk bubbles, the cartoonist demands you fill in the blanks.
This call and response gives the reader far more of a jolt than aparagraph in a book could. Even better, it gives the cartoonist theconfidence to proceed boldly. He knows you’re there, volleying withhim, interacting with the idea as you read it.

The first law of mass media,"Organizations will work tirelessly to de-personalize every communication medium they encounter.
Radio ads used to be live, personal and spoken by an individual.TV ads used to feature actual people, demonstrating something, usually live.Phone calls involved a live speaker, talking, with permission, to another person.Email used to be honest interactions between consenting adults.Facebook pages (and Wikipedia, too) were built by people, not staffs.Twits came from real people, and so did instant messages.
One by one, the mass marketers have insisted on robocalling, spamming, jingling and lying their way into our lives. The pronoun morphs from ""you"" to ""me"" to ""us"" to ""the corporation"" …
The public works tirelessly to flee to actual interactions between real people, and our organizations work even more diligently (and with more leverage) to corporatize and anonymize the interactions.
The irony, of course, is that an organization with guts can go in the opposite direction and win.

‘Where to’ might not be as important as ‘how loud’,"Here’s what they say to you when you graduate: ""What are you going to do now?""
And here’s what they say to you when you’re about to leave on vacation: ""Where are you going?""
In marketing (and thus, in life) it might be a lot more important to know, ""How are you going to do the next thing?"" or ""How are you going to do your vacation?""
Direction is drilled into us. Picking the right direction is critical. If you don’t know the right direction, sit tight until you figure it out.
The hyperactive have trouble with this advice. So they flit like a hummingbird, dashing this way and that, trying this tactic or that strategy until something works big, then they run with it.
What we’re seeing, again and again, is that both of these strategies rarely work.
Organizations that sit tight tend to get verry comfortable with sitting, and they don’t move when they need to move. They want proof that the direction is the right direction, they study it, consider it, test it, and the next thing you know, they are fourth in a three-person market.
Organizations (and leaders, and followers) that flit have a similar problem. They’re so good at flitting, so happy with it, that they continue to flit even when a decent path shows up. (ClassicDipbehavior). No direction is perfect, so we play with a strategy for a while, but you know what, flitting is more fun, so we go back to that.
The alternative is to do your best to pick a direction (hopefully an unusual one, hopefully one you have resources to complete, hopefully one you can do authentically and hopefully one you enjoy) and then do it. Loudly. With patience and passion. (Loud doesn’t mean boorish. Loud means proud and joyful and with confidence.)
No flitting, no waiting for proof. Just consistent, overwhelming performance in pursuit of a vision you believe in. That’s far more important than which direction you chose in the first place. And yes, I think it’s a marketing decision, because the market embraces ‘how.’

More vs. enough,"Lesley reminds us ofHerzberg’s workon hygiene.
It’s not just theory, it’s a vitally important marketing concept. It’s easy to believe that joy lives on a simple curve. If you give me more of what I want, you give me more joy.
If one baseball game is good, season tickets are better. If $300 an hour for consulting is good, $400 is better.
Improved = more.
It turns out, though, that there isn’t just one curve, there are two. The second one is about hygiene. Not just being clean, of course, but being in an environment in which certain requirements are met. All the farm-fresh groceries in the world won’t make you happy if your kitchen is filled with bugs. A high-paying job that delivers a screaming boss, no job security and a home life fraught with tension isn’t a stable place for most people. Not because the money isn’t there, but because basic ""hygiene"" needs aren’t being met.
We see this with computer hardware and software (crashing is a hygiene issue). We see it with thrift stores for food (freshness, or the appearance of it, is more important than money for many people). And we see it with every human resource issue.
Next time you try to grow market share, while it may be tempting to lower price or offer more features, perhaps it’s worth considering addressing unfixed hygiene issues instead.","August 25, 2008","Hygiene, Marketing, Value"

The decision before the decision,"A friend sent me a business plan the other day. He outlined four or five elements of the project he was launching and wanted my feedback on each.
In our haste to get started, we jump ahead.
He’d already decided to launch a project. To make it a non-profit. To build it on a scale of a million dollars a year. To do projects that would involve certain types of growth but avoid others. To include primarily live events instead of online or media properties. He’d also decided not to create a self-propelling movement, not to be tribe-focused and not to be huge (or tiny).
That’s a lot of decisions to make before you start.
Someone I met has a big idea. He asked me, ""What should I title the book so the publisher will promote it?""There’s a book? There’s a publisher?
Your choices used to be astonishingly limited. Now, they’re relatively infinite. Not just the choice of what color to make the logo, but the whether or not choices. Perhaps you don’t need a live conference. Perhaps you don’t need to write a book. Perhaps you don’t need to start a non-profit. Perhaps you can spread your ideas and generate impact with more speed and more power but with a lot less traditional overhead.
I’m probably wrong, but making the decision before you make the decision seems backward.","August 23, 2008","decision-making, business planning, project launch"
Beating the status quo,"[Updated:Upending a finely tuned machine:It’s pretty clear that this post and the one before were seen by practitioners of click advertising as just plain stupid. If you read them the way they read them, that interpretation is entirely possible, and I apologize. My intent was to point out that we’re creating a culture of surfers who just don’t click on ads, which has far-reaching effects for our medium. For those that saw some other intent, I’m sorry. I’ll try to do better next time.]
My last post about ads as tips led to a firestorm in my inbox, so a few thoughts:
1. I’m not suggesting click fraud, far from it. Just as you’re more likely to go to a restaurant that advertised in a magazine you like, you’re more likely to click on an ad that lives on a relevant page you liked. Click fraud is a whole different game (primarily because the clicker benefits).
2. Much more important than that is thinking about the status quo:
The way that text ads work is this: you pay by the click. Then, after someone clicks, you get a chance on the page they land on to sell them something (a product, a service, signing up for a free newsletter, whatever).
The goal of the marketer is to have no one click on the ad EXCEPT for people who intend to buy. In fact, clever marketers try to sneak in ads that are unappealing enough that only the truly motivated will actually click.
And so, given the status quo, you beat it by getting fewer clicks and converting the ones you do get.
BUT
What if it became common for popular pages to generate lots of clicks? What if some of those clickers were less motivated?
Well, under the original status quo (TV thinking) this is good, because you got a chance to immerse someone in an entire page you designed. In other words, a chance to convert mild interest into big interest.
Under the current status quo  (click thinking) this is bad, because you paid for a window shopper.
My point was that if everyone started clicking, clickthrough rates would go up. For a while, there’d be an imbalance, and sites would make too much and advertisers would pay too much.
But then, advertisers would use the landing pages to start converting. They’d adjust to the new status quo, to seeing a stream of happy clickers who came through because they liked the page they were on. And they’d get better at converting those folks (something that doesn’t happen now, because only the hardcore click through). Do you see the benefit? If more people convert, the budget goes up. The spend can increase because converting mild interest (which they don’t see now in a rare-click world) into sales is profitable.
I think the most robust ad environment for the web is one in which more surfers give permission to more marketers to make their case. And one way to get that permission is to have a culture in which surfers agree to ""pay"" attention in exchange for great content.
Who wins?
Surfers, who get more great content and might actually learn about something they want to invest in.
Content providers, who get more money in the short run and in the long run, as more ads convert more people.
Advertisers, who can begin to reach the unreachable non-clickers.
The irony is not lost on me. The people who so desperately interrupt everyone all the time are now squealing because I’m recommending that more people pay attention to their offers.","August 22, 2008","click advertising, status quo, content conversion"
Ads are the new online tip jar,"""I never click on ads.""
It’s almost a badge of honor to say that. The subtext is, ""I’m too smart/busy to waste my time doing that,"" or perhaps, ""I don’t want someone to sell my attention.""
But the real effect is that you’re starving great content.
I can say this because there are no ads here but,
If you like what you’re reading, click an ad to say thanks.
Pretty simple, but not an accepted online protocol, at least not yet.
If every time you read a blog post or bit of online content you enjoyed you clicked on an ad to say thanks, the economics of the web would change immediately. You don’t have to buy anything (though it’s fine if you do). You just have to honor the writer by giving them a click.

Who’s telling you the truth about your online personal marketing?,"Yes, it’s true. People judge you.

They judge you by your teeny picture on Facebook (named, after all, after the original quick judgment document) and they judge you by your email sig file and your domain (Hotmail?!) and by the look of your bio on Squidoo or Linkedin or the number of typos in your instant messages. They even judge you by the typeface and ads on your blog.
So, are you gettinggood feedbackon your brand presentation?
Would it hurt your feelings if I told you that your picture made you look dumpy? Or that it was boring? Or way too outre?
It seems like it’s better to hear this from a few trusted people than to continue to stumble without knowing why.
I’m not proposing that you let the crowd dictate, or that you work hard to fit in. Far from it. I’m proposing that you know the impact your choices are having and act accordingly.
Pictures are the easiest. Post three or four and let trusted people vote (and tell you why). Don’t pick the winner, but read their reasons. And yes, if connecting online is important to you, go ahead and spend a few dollars and get a good photo.

Creating stories that resonate,"Every person in the market has a worldview when it comes to what you’re selling. It might be, ""I don’t care about that,"" or it might be, ""all big companies are evil"" or it might be, ""I love new stuff.""
When your story aligns with my worldview, we have something to discuss. When it doesn’t, you’re likely to be invisible.
A worldview is a lot like the strings on a piano or the cables in a bridge. When it hits something that is of the same frequency, it resonates. The cause and the effect embrace each other and the story sticks, and spreads.
It’s essentially impossible to tell a story to an entire population and have it resonate with all of them. The global warming story, for example, has influenced some people a great deal and been dismissed out of hand by others.
While most marketers spend their time telling stories about themselves, politicians spend a lot of time telling (negative) stories about the competition. It’s illuminating, because it makes the resonance idea really clear. [The rest of this post is about politics. It’s okay with me if you skip it, feel free to do so if you expect to be offended.]
Here are two stories:
Barack Obama is hopelessly liberal. He will raise our taxes, and he’s not a real American. You can’t trust him.
and
John McCain is a fake. He will say and do anything to be elected, and he is just four more years of our last mistake.
Choose your story (or the competition’s story) wisely, because you have to live with it for a long time, and if it’s not authentic, if it doesn’t hold up, you’re left with nothing. In the case of an election, the effect of your competitor’s story on your base is critical. (And vice versa). John Kerry called George Bush dumb, but it didn’t matter, because Bush’s base didn’t care that Kerry thought he was dumb. The people who did care had already decided not to vote for Bush, so the story had no power. Will McCain’s base care that he’s a fake? Will Obama’s base care that he’s untested and different?
I think that Obama’s base isn’t as shaken by that story as McCain’s base is by the ‘fake’ one. The worldview that elected Ronald Reagan is one that admired his authenticity and his ability to stick to his principles. George Bush took advantage of that same worldview in the stories he told about being a strong leader. ""Fake"" undoes a lot of that.
The reliance on negative stories in politics makes me sick. I think we should be above that. The fact that negative stories have influenced every election of my lifetime, though, means that I’m wrong, we’re not above it. If politicians are going to tell negative stories, they might as well pick useful ones.
Start with the truth. Identify the worldview of the people you need to reach. Describe the truth through their worldview. That’s your story. When you overreach, you always fail. Not today, but sooner or later, the truth wins out. Negative or positive, the challenge isn’t just to tell the truth. It’s to tell truth that resonates.",,"resonance, worldview, storytelling"

The dead zone of slick,"
There was a terrific duo playing live music at the farmer’s market the other day. They were well-rehearsed, enthusiastic and really good. Being a patron of the arts, I bought a CD.
I hated it.
I’ve thought a lot about what turned me off, and I think it’s the curve above.
Faced with the excitement of making a CD and all the knobs and dials, they overproduced the record. They went from being two real guys playing authentic music, live and for free, and became a multi-tracked quartet in search of a professional sound. And they ended up in the dead zone. Not enough gloss to be slick, too much to be real.
This happens at restaurants all the time. Give me a handmadehuaracheand it’s fine if it’s on a paper plate. Or give me something fromThomas Keller. But I have no patience for the stuff in the dead zone, the items that are too slick to be real, but not slick enough to be a marvel. Who, exactly, wants an industrial tuna sandwich wrapped in plastic wrap?
You can send me a hand-written note (but don’t write it in crayon with words spelled wrong) and I’ll read it. And you can send me a beautifully typeset Fedex package. But if you send me mass-produced junk with a dot matrix printer, out it goes. The dead zone again.
That’s why really well done HTML email works, as does unique, hand-typed text email. It’s the banal stuff in the middle that people don’t read. And yet, 95% of what I see is precisely in the dead spot of the middle zone.

Can you bully someone into a sale?,"Of course you can.
It’s human nature to resist saying yes. Human nature makes us hesitate, sometimes for a week or a month, at the very last minute, at the moment of truth.
One technique to get through this hesitation is to be a sales bully.
Sales bullies describe their approach as ethical, because, after all, it’s in the best interest of the prospect to say yes. It’s okay to be a sales bully when you’re trying to get someone to take their TB medicine, so it must be okay to be a sales bully to get them to sign this contract.
And it works. On some people.
The flaw in thinking is this… the people you most want to sell to won’t respond well to this. The people you most need to spread the word, the people who are the best partners, the most loyal customers–they blanch in the face of bullying. They walk out.
So, if bullying is the only tool you’ve got, it makes sense to focus on an audience that responds to it (and lower your expecations accordingly). Even better, get some new tools.",,"sales bullying, ethical persuasion, customer resistance"
The intangibles,"Let’s say your service costs more than the commodity-oriented competition (I hope it does!).
Where do you find repeat business or even new business? How do you make a sale (to another business or to a consumer) when you cost more?
The answer, of course, is the intangibles. The things that have no price. Things that customers value more than it costs you to provide them.
If you don’t have that, all you can do is beg. And begging is not a scalable strategy.
If you find yourself saying, ""the boss won’t let me lower the price,"" or ""we’re more expensive, but that’s because our cost structure is higher,"" then you’re selling the intangibles too short. The stuff people can’t buy at any price, from anyone else, but that they really value…
Here are some random ways you can embrace some intangibles:
Simple example: Ideo. Check them on each one of these criteria and you’ll see why they have a waiting list.
When providers are stressed or scared or pressured, they instinctively resort to price. It feels real and reliable. It’s a trap, I’m afraid. It’s the intangibles that drive all of the non-commodity decisions, and your job is to build remarkable ones and tell stories about them.","August 14, 2008","Intangibles, Value, Non-Commodity"
Old marketing with new tools,"Remember hand-written thank you notes?
Then they became xeroxed form letters.
And then mail-merged form letters.
And then Amazon order confirmations by email.We tend to use new tools to do less.We try to save time and money at the same time, and end up depersonalizing and commodifying what we do.
A simple example: cost and speed pressure means that when you get your car serviced, it’s unlikely you’ll be greeted by the mechanic himself, wiping his hands on a greasy rag, telling you exactly what he did to your car. Instead, you’ll get a difficult to decipher printout.
Why not use the technology to give more?
The mechanic can have a simple digital voice recorder. As he works, he can describe each thing he’s testing and what he finds. You can then email the digital file to Iowa, India orIsrael,have it typed up and beautifully formatted and waiting for the customer when he returns. How can that not be worth the $1.50 it would cost?
Or have your private school or summer camp record a 7 minute video on every student every month (that’s a seven minute a day commitment per teacher) and post them privately. Seven minutes is the equivalent of a three-page personal letter, with far less resistance on the part of the teacher.
A friend of mine is wrestling with this right now. It’s so so easy to hide behind technology, to use it as a shield, instead of as a clever tool to actually get you closer to the customers you depend on.
Another example: if you have high-value customers, you should never give them a mass Survey Monkey type survey. It’s dehumanizing and it sends exactly the wrong message. Instead, ask them for feedback by email or web form. A few easy toss up questions and then just ask whether they’d recommend you and why.
If you get 200 responses, you ought to care enough to read and reply yourself. If you get 2,000, go hire someone to digest them all and make it easy for you to see the trends.
Inertia is one reason that techniques like these aren’t done often, but the real reason is fear. We use technology to insulate us from our customers instead of bringing us closer.","August 13, 2008","personalization, technology, customer engagement"
Thoughts on popcorn,"I don’t like popcorn.
But today, walking by a bowl of it, I took some.
Most people do. The thing about popcorn is that it is a low investment, low risk snack. You can eat it if you’re not hungry. You can successfully have a tiny portion. You are virtually certain that it will taste very much like your last popcorn snack.
There are products that are as easy to sample as popcorn. And making your product more popcorn-like is a great idea.
At the same time, it’s interesting to note that very few people make a lot of money from popcorn. For a product this ubiquitous, it’s surprisingly unsuccessful. Coke and Nike and Marlboro are a lot more powerful than Jiffy Pop.
So, the second lesson is that you want to make the sampling popcorn-like, but the commitment to be far bigger than it is for popcorn. Easy trial and consistent quality can lead to low commitment, not a great combination.

The difficult choice,"In a review ofThe Dip, a listener writes,
""Many winners and people or companies that get great results or windup on top simply stumbled into winning or lucked out! He ignores thewhole notion of how randomness plays into people or companies beingwinners or losers. But that’s the whole point of these types of books –to make you feel like you have more control over your destiny. I wouldargue that luck and randomness play at least as big a role as all ofthis dip stuff.""
Without a doubt, luck is involved. I don’t think anyone would tell you otherwise. The choice one needs to make, though is this:
Either you believe that luck is dominant, in which case, why bother with effort?orYou believe that luck is random, in which case it can be eliminated from your thinking and you can focus on all the stuff youcancontrol.
I don’t think luck alone gets you into Harvard Law School or a clerkship at the Supreme Court. I don’t think luck gets someone to buy your car (the best in its class and a great value) instead of the lame alternative.
I’ve been astonishingly lucky with many elements of my career. Mostly because solid singles turned into doubles or the occasional homer. I figure most of the failures are my fault and many of the successes were really good breaks. But I can’t imagine how lonely and depressing it would be to view myself as nothing but a pinball, batted around by forces over which I have no influence.
The problem with not assigning it all to luck, of course, is that you’re not only responsible for your wins, you’re also responsible for your losses. This decision also means you’ve got a lot to do all day.
Waiting for the fickle finger of fate to point at you (and cursing the universe until it does) is a lousy strategy. What a shame that so many people rationalize their lives this way. It might be a useful rationalization, but how does it increase the likelihood you’ll get what you want?","August 11, 2008","Luck, Control, Responsibility"
The secret of the web (hint: it’s a virtue),"Patience.
Google was a very good search engine for two years before you started using it.
The iPod was a dud.
I wrote Unleashing the Ideavirus 8 years ago. A few authors tried similar ideas but it didn’t work right away. So they gave up.Boingboingis one of the most popular blogs in the world because they never gave up.
The irony of the web is that the tactics work really quickly. You friend someone on Facebook and two minutes later, they friend you back. Bang.
But the strategy still takes forever. The strategy is the hard part, not the tactics.
I discovered a lucky secret the hard way about thirty years ago: you can outlast the other guys if you try. If you stick at stuff that bores them, it accrues. Drip, drip, drip you win.
It still takes ten years to become a success, web or no web. The frustrating part is that you see your tactics fail right away. The good news is that over time, you get the satisfaction of watching those tactics succeed right away.
The trap: Show up at a new social network, invest two hours, be really aggressive with people, make some noise and then leave in disgust.
The trap: Use all your money to build a fancy website and leave no money or patience for the hundred revisions you’ll need to do.
The trap: read the tech blogs and fall in love with the bleeding-edge hip sites and lose focus on the long-term players that deliver real value.
The trap: sprint all day and run out of energy before the marathon even starts.
The media wants overnight successes (so they have someone to tear down). Ignore them. Ignore the early adopter critics that never have enough to play with. Ignore your investors that want proven tactics and predictable instant results. Listen instead to your real customers, to your vision and make something for the long haul. Because that’s how long it’s going to take, guys.","August 10, 2008","patience, strategy, long-term success"
The bitter taste of nickels and dimes,"Stopped by a Whole Foods early one morning this week for an iced tea.
I ordered a hot rooibos (you should try it) poured over a glass of ice.
Whole Foods is under two kinds of pressure: shareholders that want better results, and consumers who point out that it’s really expensive. They’re working hard to position themselves as not so expensive.
Anyway, the tea was $1.79 (a 90% gross margin) but the ice cost 50 cents extra.
Huh?
I mentioned to the cash register person that I wasn’t going to pay fifty cents for ice. Understandingly, she said, ""no problem.""
And then, instead of doing what I expected (giving me the precious ice for free), she didn’t give me the ice. I had hot tea. I got what I paid for.
The thing is, Whole Foods didn’t get what they wanted. They focused on the add on revenue and generated ill will. No joy in Mudville that morning.
The problem with the infinite add on gross margin strategy is that it doesn’t work on everyone. The problem with charging $95 to deliver a $10,000 purchase is that all the buyer remembers is the indignity of the add on.
Here’s my advice: have all the add ons you want. But waive them early and often. Waive the charges for great customers or for customers that make a face or just because it’s Tuesday. ""Well, the to go charge is usually a dollar, but since you come here a lot, no charge for you.""

"When in doubt, (don’t) follow the money","People need to understand motivation in order to make sense of a story. When we see a person or a business take action, our first move is to try to figure out their motivation. The why. The what’s in it for them.
We want to know why someone is acting the way they are. Your customers or your friends or your investors or your boss want to know what makes you tick.
And the reflex explanation is: money.

A going out of business sale? Oh, they’re in pain, so I get to save money.
He recommended that book, but that’s because he got a kickback from Amazon.
She wants me to buy that service because she works on commission.
Of course, in a few cases, this is exactly the correct explanation. Except it almost always isn’t.
People don’t volunteer long hours at the museum or at an online forum for the money. There isn’t any.
People don’t work nights and weekends at some jobs because they have to… they have colleagues that get paid just as much who work less.
I smiled a bit when I saw a few posts from people who suggested I started the Triiibe group as some sort of grand scheme to sell books. I’ve gotta tell you, there are far easier ways to sell a few thousand copies of a book than to build and run an online community.
No, people (most people) don’t do things only for money. There’s usually a minimum threshold that gets someone to pick a job and stick with it, but beyond that, the things we do are expressions of who we are and what we love and the impact we wish to make, not selfish acts designed to earn a few extra bucks. (No one paid you to read this post, I bet).
All other things being equal,people pick what pays the best. All other things being equal, people buy the cheapest one. Fortunately for marketers, all other things are rarely equal. People don’t all sign up to work at Goldman Sachs. Most of the meaning and activity in our lives comes from the things we do for free, or the choices we make about work, not the financial exchanges we do to support ourselves.

Is architect a verb?,"I confess. I like using it that way.
I think architecting something is different from designing it. I hope you can forgive me but I think it’s a more precise way to express this idea.
Design carries a lot of baggage related to aesthetics. We say something is well-designed if it looks good. There are great designs that don’t look good, certainly, but it’s really easy to get caught up in a bauhaus, white space, font-driven, Ideo-envy way of thinking about design.
So I reserve “architect” to describe the intentional arrangement of design elements to get a certain result.
You can architect a computer server set up to make it more efficient. You can architect a train station to get more people per minute through the turnstiles.
More interesting, you can architect a business model or a pricing structure to make it far more effective at generating the behavior you’re looking for. Most broken websites aren’t broken because they violate common laws of good design. They’re broken because their architecture is all wrong. There’s no strategy in place.
Stew Leonard’s, which used to be my favorite supermarket example, is architected to extract large amounts of money from customers. One example: there’s only one route through the store. You start at the beginning and work your way to the end. No one goes there to buy a half-gallon of milk. And he’s not going to win any design competitions either…
Architecture, for me anyway, involves intention, game theory, systems thinking and relentless testing and improvement. Fine with me if you want to call it design, just don’t forget to do it.","August 7, 2008","architect, design, intentionality"

Complicit,"Are consumers responsible for the behavior of marketers?
Why does spam exist? Because (some) people respond to it. Why are ineffective pharmaceuticals so heavily marketed? Because (some) people demand that doctors prescribe them. Why are so many local stores struggling? Because so many customers cross the street to the big box stores.
I’ve maintained for years that marketing is so powerful that marketers have to take responsibility for the choices they make. And they do.
But what about us? What about the New York Times reporter who writes an entirecolumnabout the cheap grill he bought at Home Depot–he’s upset that it didn’t come with better service… At some level, isn’t he getting what he paid for? And when consumers so often choose the cheapest possible tickets for air travel, aren’t we arguing for a lousy product?
When I go back to a convenient B2B vendor even though they treated me poorly last time, aren’t I complicit in rewarding that attitude?
(And please (!) if you think we need more ads like this or more stores like this or more service like this, go for it… you have the very same power in supporting them as you might in criticizing them. Consumers are also complicit when they fail to support the organizations that they agree with).

Should you ignore the n00bs?,"In the old days, a common DOS warning ended with, ""…press any key.""
And yes, there were plenty of tech support calls that asked, ""where is the ANY key?""
Every interaction with your public runs the risk that some people just won’t get it. They won’t understand the protocol at your jazz club, or figure out how they use that new thing you just built. They won’t get your verbal shorthand or they’ll be frustrated by your presumption that they’re insiders.
One approach is to n00b-proof your offerings. To create products and services so simple and so well-explained that every single person will get it. Big warnings, extra paragraphs of copy, limited features… make it idiot-proof.
The problem with this approach is that you can never be simple enough. And of course, the bigger problem: Once you dumb it down so every single person gets it, you bake out the magic and the mystery and the elegance. Simple example: it’s not obvious how to use an iPhone, not obvious what to do when you walk into a church for the first time, not clear what to do when you visit Facebook for the first time either. At the symphony, should there be big applause signs so that people don’t clap at the wrong time?
Great design is intuitive. Great design eliminates confusion. But not for everyone, not all the time. The words and interactions you use often have a sophistication that will confuse some portion of your audience.
Why not consider making it easy for the confused to ask for help? And treat them with respect when they do. If you don’t create a little confusion, it’s unlikely you’ve built something remarkable.
And to go one step further: sometimes it’s okay to lose the n00bs. Not in an arrogant way (except for some brands) but in a way that says, ""this might just not be for you…""","August 5, 2008","n00b-proofing, design, audience engagement"

Sing it (please S I N G  I T),"Sing it!
I spent some time a few days ago listening to a nascent band performing classic rock songs.
The first group sang a note-for-note rendition of a song by the Stones. The notes were right, but nothing else was. The singer didn’t know what the song meant. And the musicians, they just stood there. No energy, no smiles, no connection. It could have been a funeral with a great soundtrack.
A concert isn’t about the music, is it? And a restaurant isn’t about the food.
The funny thing is that learning toSing Itis a lot easier than learning how to play the guitar. For some reason, we work on the technique before we worry about adding the joy.

And on a recent math test, the challenge for students to answer each question to the nearest tenth. Question five was something like, ""what is 10.2 plus 1.8?"" Answering ""12"" would cost you a point, apparently, because the correct answer is 12.0.

Please understand that I have no problem at all with precision. Precision is great, it’s essential to engineering and to the function of many elements of society. It’s almost impossible to be on time without precision, and quality depends on it.

Here’s my idea from four years ago. I wish I had pushed it harder:
Dedicate a half hour every night during the last month to a debate series. Put it on a major channel. Or devote an entire cable channel to this, year round. Or a special section of YouTube.
Each side is invited. There is no moderator. There’s a chess clock. Each side gets 15 minutes total. While you’re talking, your clock is running, but the other side’s is not. When you’re done, her clock runs. You can talk for ten seconds or ten minutes or whatever you choose. You can ask questions of your opponent, answer questions, make a speech. Whatever you want. It could even be done from two different locations.
Every night. Thirty days.
If you don’t show up, your opponent gets the entire airtime slot.
This works best in a limited channel universe, where the airtime is actually worth something, and who knows, it’s possible this will be true in four years (but unlikely). Either way, it goes a long way to helping us find thoughtful people who can think clearly (hard to fake it for thirty nights in a row).

Probably not stupid,"Your difficult boss, customer, prospect, voter, student… probably not stupid, probably just uninformed. There’s a huge difference.
Every person makes decisions based on their worldview and the data at hand. If two people have the same worldview and the same data, they’ll make the same decision, every time (unless they’re stupid.)
So, there are plenty of times where a lack of information leads to a bad decision. Plenty of times where an out of sync worldview leads to an out of sync decision.
When the board of directors embraces a fading old media model instead of embracing a strategy that leads to rapid growth, it’s probably because each of them started with a worldview about the way things worked and were going to work. Add to that little direct experience, and it’s no wonder they decided what they did. You would too if you were given the same resources to begin with.
Changing worldviews is very difficult and requires quite a bit of will. Changing the data at hand is a lot easier, and that’s where marketing can really help. If you, as a marketer, can package data in a way that people with a certain worldview can accept, you move the conversation forward far more quickly than if you merely dismiss the non-customers or the doubters as stupid.
In my experience, a closed-minded worldview (""I can’t read that book, I disagree with it"") is the most difficult hurdle to overcome. But a closed-minded worldview doesn’t mean you’re stupid, it means that you are selling yourself and your colleagues and your community short.
The easiest way to grow is to sell to people who share a worldview that endorses your position. The most effective way to grow bigger than that is to inform those that disagree with your position–more data in a palatable form. And, unfortunately, it turns out that the best way to change the world is to open the closed-minded.","September 23, 2008","Worldview, Decision-Making, Marketing"
How much extra for nice?,"If I pay $1000 extra for a first-class seat, odds are the flight attendant will be nice to me.
If I pay $2000 extra for the presidential suite at the hotel, odds are the front desk clerk will be nice to me.
If I give the valet $50 to park my car, odds are he’ll be nice to me as well.
So, here’s the question: if all I want, the only extra, is for someone to be nice to me when I visit your business, how much extra does that cost? How much extra to talk to a nice person when I call tech support? How much extra to find a nice receptionist at the doctor’s office? Would you pay $9 extra for a smile when you dealt with the Social Security bureaucrats and were filing a form?
I know you’re rushed and stressed and stretched. I know your team deals with hundreds or thousands of customers, and a lot of them aren’t very friendly or warm. And I know that some of your customers (maybe a lot) would happily pay a little extra to get that one thing they want most of all…
I think there’s a huge gap between what people are willing to pay for nice (a lot) and what it would cost businesses to deliver it (almost nothing). Smells like an opportunity.","September 22, 2008","customer service, value of kindness, business opportunity"

What advertising can’t fix,"If you spend more than a quarter of a billion dollars on an ad campaign for a tech company, people will talk about it. If you give Jerry Seinfeld, the most famous comedian ever, $10 million to be in a few of the commercials you do, people will talk about it even more.
Microsoft has fallen into a trap that befalls many large companies in search of cred, buzz or respect. They’ve decided to buy some via advertising.
For more than twenty years, Microsoft has relentlessly commodified itself and the software it makes. It has worked to become a monopoly, a semi-faceless organization that cranks out very good (or pretty good) software that gets a job done for the middle of the market. It’s been a profitable strategy.
But now they have Apple envy.
The Zune plays music, the iPod is the badge of a tribe.
A PC laptop runs Excel. A Macbook Air generates buzz and creates joy.
The answer must be to run better ads! And lots of them.
Question: When was  the last time you met an Apple employee who was truly passionate about the products she made or sold? My guess is this happened the last time you went to an Apple store. When was the last time you had a similar experience with a Microsoft employee?
If you talk to Google employees, odds are that they are totally engaged and on a mission to change the way people interact with the internet and with information. Talk to a Microsoft person and they will be happy to talk about reliability or standards they set or the way to engage the bureaucracy of the organization.
Microsoft may very wellnotbe broken. The world needs reliable bureaucracies that mollify the needs of corporations and individuals in the center of the market. But if it is broken, advertising isn’t going to fix it.
[Before the legions of committed and engaged Microsoft employees reading this write in, please consider my point. I’m not saying that there aren’t large pockets of innovation or joy at Microsoft. I’m saying that Vista and PowerPoint and Microsoft’s other core non-game products are largely devoid of personality and are optimized to be sold to organizations that prefer it that way. Microsoft can change this if they want to, but until they do, running ads pretending to be something other than that is a waste of money.]","September 20, 2008","Microsoft, advertising, corporate identity"
Thinking bigger,"""How do you like the draft of the new brochure?"" asks the boss.
There are several responses available to you, in order of wonderfulness:
Where are you on this scale?
You could hire a brilliant graphic designer to take your bullet-filled powerpoint and fix the fonts and clean it up. But would it change the game?
When in doubt, challenge the strategy, not the tactics.
Simple example of thinking bigger: What if you hiredJill Greenbergto Photoshop well-known people in your industry to turn them into memorable images instead?
Every day you have the chance to completely reimagine what it is to communicate via Powerpoint. What Marc Andreessen has done is to completely reimagine what it is to be online. That’s where the win lies, when you reinvent.
The bigger point is thatnone of us are doing enough to challenge the assignment.Every day, I spend at least an hour of my time looking at my work and what I’ve chosen to do next and wonder, ""is this big enough?""
Yesterday, I was sitting with a friend who runs a small training company. He asked, ""I need better promotion. How do I get more people to take the professional type design course I offer at my office?"" My answer was a question, as it usually is. ""Why is the course at your office?"" and then, ""Why is it a course and not accreditation, or why not turn it into a guild for job seekers, where you could train people and use part of the tuition to hire someone to organize a private job board? You could guarantee clients well-trained students (no bozos) and you could guarantee students better jobs… everyone wins.""
I have no idea if my idea for the training company is a good one, but I know it’s abiggerone. That’s when marketing pays for itself. Not when we find a typo or redesign a logo, but when we reconsider the question and turn the answer into something bigger than we ever expected.","September 19, 2008","innovation, reimagination, marketing strategy"
But you’re not saying anything,"Corypoints us tothis collection of logosfrom Saul Bass. Twelve giant companies, all with basically interchangeable logos.
And that’s the point. These big companies didn’t want the logo to be part of their story, they just wanted it to fit in with all the other big company logos. The only thing the logo said was, ""we’re a big company with a big company logo.""
The same thing goes on with pricing. If you price your products like the competition does, you’re not saying anything with your pricing. ""Move along, there’s nothing to see here."" Which is fine. It just means you need to tell a story with something else.
Marketing storytelling is not about doing everything differently. You do many things the same, intentionally, because those ‘same things’ aren’t part of your story. It’s the different stuff where you will be noticed, and the different stuff where you tell your story.
The layout of this blog is intentionally bland. The books I write intentionally have standard covers and paper and are sold in standard stores at standard prices (most of the time, anyway). That’s because the distribution and pricing isn’t part of what I’m trying to say.
If you’re not telling a story with some aspect of your marketing choices, then make sure that aspect is exactly what people expect. To do otherwise is to create random noise, not to further your marketing.","September 18, 2008","Marketing storytelling, branding, consistency"

The small-minded vision of the technology elite,"""There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.""
Ken Olsen, ceo of DEC,
Only 31 years ago. DEC was one of the leading computer companies of the day, but not for long.
Take a look at the geek discussion boards and you’ll see an endless list of sharp-tongued critics, each angling to shoot down one idea or another. And then take a look at the companies that show up at the various pitch shows, and you’ll see one company after another pitching incremental improvements based on current assumptions.
The reason is simple: technologists know how to make things work.
When an engineer has a proven ability to ship stuff, to keep things humming and not crashing, it’s easy to fall into the trap of rejecting anything that hasn’t demonstrated that it can work, that hasn’t proven itself in the market.

In search of value,"The stock market is going to be bonkers today.
And for most people, it won’t matter so much. Because most of us aren’t focused on flipping assets. We’re building value by creating interactions that work, by writing stories that spread or by designing products and services that actually create something worth paying for.
That sounds like a treacly mission statement, but it’s easy to get distracted by external noise instead of focusing on what counts. Hint: They started Google in the middle of the dot com melt down.
The short-term consequences of an unstable stock market are real and uncomfortable. More (and better) adult supervision would have gone a long way, imho. But we can’t control this, all we can do is focus on what matters.

Firefox is missing the point,"I’m a devoted FF user, and have been forever.
But the response to Chrome shouldn’t be to launch new features.
Here’s the problem/challenge: when your friends switch to Firefox, your life doesn’t get better.
And the key to growing any piece of software (or just about any product or service, actually) is the opposite. People will recommend something if adoption improves their lives.
Fax machines? Life is better for me if you have one.
Fashion? Life is better for me if I’m not the only one wearing this.
Religious sect? Life is better for me if I’m not the only one in the building.
So, Firefox needs to add functionality that makes the surfing experience better for all users when more users use Firefox.
There are many ways to do this, and you can invent more than I ever could. Systems that allow for rating pages, or grouping them, or communicating (but only with FF users). [worth clarifying: I’m not saying that FF should arbitrarily exclude outsiders from a common form of online communication. I’m saying that FF as a tool can create new forms of communication and collaboration, forms that only work if you have the right technology. So far, web browsing hasn’t been about communication among browsers, it’s largely a monologue from the site to the user. The browser can be a lot more than that.]

Breakage,"The supply and demand curve isn’t a curve. It’s an abstraction of lots of individual behaviors.
And so, lots of organizations end up hitting a wall with no warning.
My car insurance bill has been steadily rising, year after year, despite the fact that I have a clean record. The logic, I’m sure, was, ""well, let’s raise it a little and see who quits…""
If revenue increases enough to make up for the few who quit, you come out ahead. So, quarter after quarter, year after year, repeat the same process. Raise it a little, check to see if revenue rises in aggregate, and repeat.
I’d get the bill, sigh about the fee, consider the hassle of switching, pay the bill and move on.
Until last week. Last week the number was too high. Something in my relationship with the insurance company shattered. After all, it’s not like they had done anything for me, not like I knew anyone there. It was just momentum. And the number was suddenly enough to make me take action.
19 minutes later, I was at Geico.
The problem for my insurance company is that a whole bunch of people will do this at once. When you hit the breaking point with one person, it might be 1,000 or 100,000 people who do the same thing at the same time. And you don’t get a second chance. They’re gone.

Listening to the loud people,"Of course you should listen to your customers.
But which ones?
Should you listen to the loud ones, the ones who call the sports radio stations to complain about the pitching, the ones who post websites about your lousy service, the ones who organize nationwide boycotts? Should you listen to the angry ones, the ones with a limited vocabulary (heavy on profanity, short on spelling) who know how to use email and aren’t afraid to use it?
Or, should you listen to the customers that are the most profitable, the most loyal or the most likely to spread word of mouth among the people you want to become your customers?
Here are three common listening mistakes:
There’s an art here, it’s not a science. I’d focus on a few tactics:
And here’s one thing I’d do on a regular basis: Get a video camera or perhaps a copy machine and collect comments and feedback from the people who matter most to your business.

How often should you publish?,"How many movies should you star in next year?
How many records should you release? How many songs should you write?
How many times a week should you post to your blog?
And when should my next book come out? Or your next newsletter or that next cartoon? What about Nike–they launch more than one product every day. Is that too many?
A lot of the stuff marketers make is unanticipated, impersonal, irrelevant junk that consumers merely tolerate.
But some of it is not spam, it’scontent.Stuff worth reading, worth paying for (at the very least, worth paying attention to.)
So, how often?
This discussion is usually filled with superstitions, traditions and half-truths. Daily comics come out every day because that’s when newspapers always came out. And newspapers came out once a day because it was too expensive to publish three times a day (and advertisers and readers wouldn’t support the extra expense.)
When movies were met with great fanfare and often stayed in the theaters for months, it was suicide for a big movie star to do three or four movies a year. But in a DVD/YouTube world, there’s not a lot of evidence that this pace makes as much sense. Saturday Night Live was on every week because there’s only one Saturday a week, but if it had launched today, it’s hard to see the benefit of it being a weekly…
I’d like to propose that you think about it differently. There’sfrontlistandbacklist.
Frontlist means the new releases, the hits, the stuff that fanboys are looking for or paying attention to.
Frontlist gets all the attention, all the glory and all the excitement. They write about frontlist in the paper and we talk about the frontlist at dinner. Digg is the frontlist. Siskel and Ebert is the frontlist.
Backlist isCatcher in the Ryeor1984. Backlist is the long tail (the idea) and now, theLong Tail(the book). In a digital world, backlist is where the rest of the attention ends up, and where all the real money is made.
Backlist doesn’t show up in the news, butGoogle is 95% backlist. So is Amazon.
Sitting in a meeting yesterday, I brainstormed a term, ""haystack marketing."" I googled it to see if someone else was using it. You guessed it–number one match was an article I wrote eight months ago. Google doesn’t forget even if you do.
So, here’s the strategy:
Frontlist reaches your fans. Your fans spread the word, and eventually your backlist reaches everyone else. The backlist turns some people into fans, who then look for the frontlist.
The bestselling fiction authors (with one exception) all got hassled by their publishers for writing too often. Erle Stanley Gardner, Agatha Christie, Stephen King, JK Rowling… all but one had to write under a pseudonym because their publishers said they wrote too much. Nonsense. They wrote for their tribe, they give their followers just barely enough to read. Not too much, not by a long shot. And then, they were lucky enough to have persistent and talented publishers that managed to get their backlist read, over and over, by millions of people. People who turned into fans.
Key assertion:you don’t publish it unless it’s good. You don’t write more blog posts than you can support, don’t ship more variations of that software than your engineers can make marvelous. But given that you’ve got enough bench strength, enough remarkability to spare, now what?
When I look at my work, I think I’m in sync with my readers–one blog post a day feels right, while ten (which somebloggerspull off) wouldn’t work for us. One book a year feels right, while three a decade (whichMalcolm Gladwelldoes) wouldn’t work for me or my core readers.
On the other hand, I do a lousy job of self-marketing my backlist. I have no doubt that a more patient push ofThe Dipwould have doubled the numbers of books I sold (but posting about quitting all the time would have annoyed you guys to no end). It’s still selling well, but given the base of sales (a big frontlist launch can lead to even bigger backlist, of course), more focus on the backlist would have been a profitable choice. The thing is, organizations can do this far better than an individual author can.
[Example: In the last month, four of my books have been mentioned in the NY Times. (The Dip,All Marketers are Liars,Meatball SundaeandSmall is the New Big.) All backlist. All to people not in our tribe. This is far more useful and surprisingly, predictable, than the hit or miss nature of frontlist promotion. In my case, I think I’m putting my skills to better use when I’m writing, but that means I need to figure out how my backlist is going to get noticed. If you’ve got a team, part of the team should obsess about the backlist, honing it, editing it and promoting it, while the rest work to generate (as opposed to promote) the frontlist.]
The opportunity isn’t to give into temptation and figure out how to recklessly and expensively market the frontlist. It is to adopt a long and slow and ultimately profitable strategy of marketing your ever-growing backlist.","September 10, 2008","publishing frequency, frontlist vs backlist, marketing strategy"

Spin,"Humans are lie detectors.
We hear stories. We enjoy them. We try them on for size. We’re looking for falsehoods and we sniff them out.
We value the truth and we enjoy it. And we’re always wary about the occasional lie.
That’s why political season is just so w e i r d.
The spinners lie constantly. They lie with a straight face. They lie sentence after sentence, relentlessly.
Like the uncanny valley, we don’t really know what to do in the face of non-stop lying. Is this person an alien? Do they think we’re stupid? How are we supposed to respond to the onslaught of disrespect?
Some people suspend disbelief and just believe all of it. In an internet era, I’m wondering if that’s going to continue to be true. Once we see video evidence of a few lies, it all starts to unravel (or ravel, depending on your use of English). A cynic would say that the ravelling is a pleasure to watch, and the media enjoys it too.
But the spinners continue to spin, as relentlessly as ever. I wonder if this election is going to mark the end of classic spin or the beginning of a whole new class of even slicker lying.
And since most marketers follow the lead of politicians, I wonder what it means for the rest of us? Is there new slack for truthiness? Is the jaded consumer even more likely to stand by as marketers continue to fabricate falsehoods by the yard? I’m amazed at corporate spokespeople who utter complete falsehoods, rationalizing that it’s just their job.
All I know for sure is that it gives me a headache. I think there’s a huge opportunity for a trusted media source that takes on spin from all quarters and throws it back in the face of the spinner. Show them video of themselves from last week and ask them to respond. Oh, I’m probably just being a hopeful idealist.",,"Truth, Spin, Politics"
Time,"Here’s the #1 most overlooked secret of marketing, of growing your organization, of building trust and creating for the long haul. Actually, it has two parts:
Show up on time.It doesn’t cost anything to keep your promises when it comes to time. Show up for the meeting when the meeting starts. Have the dry cleaning ready when you promise. Ship on time. Return that phone call. Finish the renovation ahead of schedule.
Boy that’s simple. Apparently, it’s incredibly difficult.
If you want to build trust, you need to be trustworthy. The simplest test of trustworthiness for most people is whether or not you keep your promises, and the first promises you make are about time.
Cherish my time.The second part is closely related. It has to do with respect. You respect my time when you don’t waste it. When you don’t spam me. When you worry about the 100 cars backed up on the road and figure out how to get us moving more quickly. You respect me when you value my time more highly than your own.
If you want someone to think you’re selfish, just ask for a minute of their time and then waste it or use it for your own ends. Or automate the process so three minutes of your time wastes three minutes of the 1,000 or one million people on your list.
In a society where so many people have enough, few people have time to spare. When you waste it (by breaking a promise and being late) or abuse it (by viewing your time as worth more than mine), we respond by distrusting you, ignoring you and eventually moving on.","September 8, 2008","Time management, Trustworthiness, Respect"

The feedback couldn’t be more clear. So why not fix it?
Verizon has mind-numbingly bad customer service. People hate to call them. People switch providers just to avoid this problem. So why not fix it?
DiFara’s makes the best pizza in New York. But it takes 90 minutes or so to get a pizza. Everyone complains, so why not fix it?
In the case of DiFara’s, the answer is easy: because fixing it would make it normal. It would take away what makes the place special. People wouldn’t complain any more, but people wouldn’t go, either.
If your ‘one big thing’ is a key part of what makes you successful, how dare you change it.
On the other hand, if momentum or laziness or lack of will (or focus) is the thing holding you back, it’s time to get serious. When you remove the one big thing from people’s list of objections, your career and organization will take off.
Joe Biden can carry a timer in his pocket. He can become reticent in public. He can, in just one day of hard work, solve his problem. Verizon can invest focus and and money and solve their problem.

The myth of launch PR,"New startups can spend hundreds of thousands of dollars racing after a dream: a giant splash on launch.
Just imagine… a big spread in Time Magazine, a feature on all the relevant blogs, a glowing review in the Book Review. Get this part right and everything else takes care of itself.
And yet.
Here are some brands that had no launch at all: Starbucks, Apple, Nike, Harry Potter, Google, William Morris, The DaVinci Code, Wikipedia, Snapple, Geico, Linux, Firefox and yes, Microsoft. (All got plenty of PR, but after the launch, sometimes a lot later).
I’m as guilty as the next entrepreneur. Great publicity is a treasured gift. But it’s hardly necessary, and the search for it is often a significant distraction.
It works for movies, in fact, it’s essentially required for movies. But for just about every product, service or company, the relentless quest for media validation doesn’t really pay. If you get it, congratulations. If you don’t, that’s just fine. But don’t break the bank or your timetable in the quest.","September 3, 2008","Launch PR, startups, media validation"
Your competitive advantage,"People are fickle, but we’re generally rational. When someone makes a choice (hiring, firing, choosing a vendor, buying a soda) they’re using some sort of internal logic and reasoning to support that choice.
As a marketer, you win when they choose you.
So, why choose you?
The answer to that question is your competitive advantage. What makes it likely that more than a few rational people will consider their options and choose you or your company or your organization?
Truth: It’s rarely a computerized cost/benefit analysis. Instead, it’s a human choice.
When the factors that matter to me are processed through my worldview and compared against the options I’m aware of, I will choose you when your advantages are greater than the competition, provided I believe that you’re worth the cost of switching.
Key points:

Worldview:Based on the way I see the world, the assumptions I make, the truth that I believe in. (Example: If I don’t trust young people as a matter of course, I’m not likely to choose you if you’re young, all other things being close).

And, with few exceptions, neither is ""we are new."" Also, ""we are better and I can prove it,"" is rarely a successful argument.

Learning from a summer intern program,"Twenty-five years ago today (boy that was a long time) I finished the internship that changed my life. My bosses at Spinnaker Software gave me a lot of room and I ran with it.
Last March, Ipostedabout an intern program I was starting.
I was overwhelmed by the quality of what I got back. (The quantity was expected… interesting internships are hard to find). I heard from students on most continents, with a huge variety of backgrounds and life experiences. And these people were smart.
Unable to just pick a PDF or two, I invited the applicants to join a Facebook group I had set up. Then I let them meet each other and hang out online.
It was absolutely fascinating. Within a day, the group had divided into four camps:
Want to guess who I hired? (It was a paid gig and five ended up spending time with me in NY on a somewhat rolling basis). If you’re hiring for people to work online, I can’t imagine not screening people in this way. Thisisthe work, and you can watch people do it for real before you hire them.
As I went to send a note to the 150 or so who didn’t make the cut, it felt like a waste. A waste for me, surely, because here were a large number of over-talented, under-employed students facing a boring summer. And for them, too, because I thought some might want a chance to continue the virtual experience.
So I started a group on Basecamp and invited the rest of the interns to try an unpaid virtual experience. The idea was that I’d provide a platform and some projects, and they could (if they thought it might be interesting) participate online. No grunt work, just interesting stuff to try. To my amazement, more than sixty took me up on it. The conversations ebbed and flowed, the work got done (or didn’t) but I think everyone learned a lot.
Part of the deal was that active participants would get a shout out here on the blog. So we’ve put togethera PDF of handmade bios of some of the coolest interns in the program. A shortcut for anyone looking for smart folks from around the world.
If I did it again, I’d definitely do it again. I think that smaller, more closely managed projects would probably lead to more productivity, but I also know that when faced with opportunity and freedom, amazing people get stuff done.
If you gave this a try, I think it would be a brilliant move, for you and for the people you work with. It’s clear that formal education is failing the smart kids entering our field (not certain what ‘our field’ is, but you know what I mean). We need to create pathways for students to discover that there’s absolutely nothing holding them back.","September 1, 2008","internship, virtual experience, talent discovery"
The new meaning of Labor Day,"Karim points us to thisupdateonKiva.org.

Reaching the right people,"Here’s agreat idea.
What if your new rock group appeals to fans of the B52s? Or if your new book is just perfect for people who like Brad Meltzer? If you have a CD or a book or an idea that will appeal to a certain psychographic, it might not be so easy to reach just those people.
Dave came up with a super idea: go buy a bunch of B52s CDs. Then list them (brand new!) for sale on Amazon and eBay. Price them ridiculously low, like a dollar. The only people who are going to buy a copy are focused fans. Then, when you ship out the CD, includeyournew CD in the box as well. You’ve reached exactly the right people (purchasers! who spent money! who are fans!) at exactly the right moment. Why not include two or three in the box? Fans know fans, and they like spreading the good stuff around.
What a shame that Amazon hasn’t figured out how to provide this as a useful service. Amazon knows who buys a lot, they know who reviews a lot… why not ask those people if they want a free prize now and then? An influential person would earn the right to a huge number of free samples. Radio DJs used to get them… but now, of course, it’s us that are the DJs…
(It doesn’t work so well for used cars, of course.)
This works for other fields as well. If you have a massage service that is the perfect complement to customers of a personal training service down the street, why not give that trainer a dozen intro gift certificates she can use to thank her best customers?
MJpoints out that the few mainstream publishers that promote their books spend $10,000 or more on ads that don’t work. Putting a book into the hands of 1,000 perfect fans may be a far smarter investment.

Rethinking defaults,"
Default: when designing a website, make every single button the same size, unless there’s a really really good reason.
This is actually a bad foundation for designing a site. The chances that every button is going to be of equal value in a given setting is close to zero. The default ought to be: when designing a website, assume that important buttons will be bigger than unimportant ones, unless there’s a good reason.
Another example: When dealing with a customer, assume that unless there is good evidence to the contrary, they are trying to rip you off.
Another example: Assume, all other things being equal, that next year will be just like this year.
And a final default: Assume that unless they’ve notified you otherwise, all prospects are willing to get spam (press releases, phone calls, letters, ads) from you.","October 30, 2008","Defaults, Web Design, Customer Assumptions"
How to lose,"Actual conversation at a local shoe store: ""Do you have dress shoes in a size 6?""
""No, I’m sorry we don’t.""
""We’re from out of town. Do you know any place we can get some?""
""I’m sorry I don’t. Perhaps you’d like some in a size 8?""
Now, what are the chances that someone who wants a size 6 is going to buy an 8? Zero. The game is over. You lost.
Instead of feigning ignorance about the whereabouts of your competitors (you really don’t know where other shoe stores are?) and instead of pretending you don’t have a phone book, what would happen if you actually spent that spare minute being incredibly helpful. ""Ask for Jimmy! Tell him Sal sent you…""
Of course, the recipient of this friendly advice would tell everyone at the wedding exactly what happened. And some of those folks wouldn’t be from out of town…
Marketers, salespeople, athletes and politicians spend their days losing. Losing RFPs, losing someone browsing through a store, losing a race.
If it’s close, the right thing to do is to lean into it, to persevere, to push at the end when it can really pay off. But what about when it’s not? What happens when the RFP doesn’t match (at all) what you sell, but the competition is a perfect fit?
If you’re not qualifying people relentlessly enough to have many opportunities like this, you’re not really qualifying them. You’re just spending all day grabbing what you can grab.
It seems to me that this is the perfect opportunity to be a statesman. This is when you earn the right to be seen as a trusted advisor, not a self-interested shill. Two months or two years from now, when you interact with that person or organization again, we’ll remember that you were the one who spoke up on behalf of the competition, the one who helped us find a better fit, the clearly disinterested advisor who helped us choose between the two remaining good choices.
Your ego might not enjoy it, but in the long run, your organization will.","October 29, 2008","customer service, trust, competition"
Failure as an event,"I try hard not to keep a running tally of big-time failures in my head. It gets in the way of creating the next thing. On the other hand, when you see failure as a learning event, not a destination, it makes you smarter, faster.
Some big ones from my past:The Boston Bar Exam.My two partners and I spent a lot of time and money building this our last year of college. It was a coupon book filled with free drinks from various bars in Cambridge and Boston. The booklet would be sold at the bars, encouraging, I dunno, drunk driving. Lessons: Don’t spend a lot on startup costs, don’t sell to bar owners and don’t have three equal partners, since once person always feels outvoted.The Internet White Pages.This was a 700 page book filled with nearly a million email addresses. It took months to create and IDG, the publisher, printed 80,000 copies. They shredded 79,000 of them. Lesson: If the Internet Yellow Pages is a huge hit (it was), that doesn’t mean the obvious counterpart will be. A directory that’s incomplete is almost always worthless.
MaxFax.This was the first fax board for the Mac. It would allow any Mac user to hit ‘print’ and send what was on the screen to any fax machine. We raised seed money from a wealthy dentist, built a working prototype and worked to license it to a big computer hardware company. Lessons: Don’t raise money from amateurs, watch out for flaky engineering if you’re selling a prototype, think twice before you enter a market with one huge player (Apple knocked off the idea) and don’t build a business hoping to sell out unless you have a clear path to do that.
I have a dozen more. The first wireless Sonos-like device. A nationwide game show using 900 numbers. A fundraising company that offered lightbulbs for sale to high school bands (lighter than fruit!).

In Defense of Raising Money: a Manifesto for NonProfit CEOs,"I wish I had written this. Sasha did.Check him out.
I’m sick of apologizing for being in charge of raising money.
I work at a great nonprofitorganization(1) that is doing great things in the world, one that’s attacking daunting problems in a powerful new way.  I believe in what we do, and think that we may be catalyzing a shift in how the world fights poverty.
So why did one of my mentors – someone with a lot of experience in the non-profit and public sector – tell me not to take this job?  “Be careful,” he said, “You’ll get pigeon-holed.  Once a fundraiser, always a fundraiser.”
He misunderstood what job I was taking.
Look around you at great leaders who you know or respect.  What do they spend their time doing?    They are infused with drive, passion, vision, commitment, and energy.  They walk through the world dissatisfied with the status quo.  They talk to anyone who will listen about the change they want to see the world.  And they build a team and an organization that is empowered to make that change.
How good is your idea?  How important is your cause?  Important enough that you’ve given up another life to lead this life.  You’ve given up another job, another steady paycheck, another bigger paycheck to do this all day long, every day, for years if not for decades, to make a change in the world and to right a wrong.
How much is your time worth?  Start at the low end: if, instead, you had worked at a big company or started your own company or worked at an investment bank or a consulting firm, how much money would the world pay you for your skills?  A few hundred thousand dollars?  A few million dollars?
That’s your baseline.  Now ask yourself: how important is the problem you’re trying to solve?  Are you trying to make sure that women have a safe, affordable place to give birth?  Creating a way for people to have clean drinking water so they and their children don’t fall ill? Protecting refugees from genocide?  Providing after school tutoring for at-risk kids?  Giving people with chronic disease a place to come together and support one another?
Sounds pretty important.
Our political system is mostly broken, but the fact that candidates have to go out and convince millions of people to get out and pull a lever for them matters.  This communication defines the terms of the debate; it defines what issues will and won’t get addressed.  And it defines accountability.  If Barack Obama really becomes President of the United States, don’t you think he’ll be just a little bit more accountable to the one million people who donated directly to his campaign?
What’s your theory of change?  How much change happens through the services you deliver?  And how much change happens by convincing the rest of the world that the problem you’re trying to address, and the way you’re trying to address it, is worth paying attention to?  It’s both, it’s not either/or.
Breast cancer has an unbelievable level of awareness in the United States, definitely ahead of all other cancers.  Yet breast cancer is actually the 5th leading cause of cancer death in the United States, behind lung, stomach, liver and colon cancer.(2)  So why does it get the most attention and the most funding?
It’s because of Nancy Brinker.
Nancy’s older sister Susan Komen died of breast cancer in 1980, at the age of 36, three years after being diagnosed with breast cancer.  In her sister’s memory, Nancy Brinker created the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, which has since raised $1 billion for breast cancer research, education and health services – and promised to raise another $2 billion in the next decade. Breast cancer research is the best-funded of all cancers,(3) and that is because of Nancy Brinker’s leadership.  Nancy decided that fighting breast cancer was worth fighting for.  Because of her efforts, drastically more resources (public and private) are in play to find a cure.
This is not about competition for resources, this is about increasing the size of the pie.  We’ve seen an unprecedented growth in global wealth in the last two decades: there are currently 95,000 ultra-high net worth individuals in the world – people with $30 million or more of investable assets.4    On top of that, there are more than $60 trillion worth of investment assets in the market today, with an increasing amount of this money thinking more long-term about the big problems facing the world: energy and water scarcity, greenhouse gases, global commodity shortages, healthcare and education delivery, poverty alleviation…you name it.
The allocation of these resources matters.
Convincing the most powerful, resource-rich people you know that allocating some of their capital to the issues you’re addressing matters.
You’re devoting your life, your spirit, your energy, your faith into making the vision you have of a better future into a reality.
So why are you so scared to ask people for money?  Why do you feel afraid to say: “This problem is so important and so urgent that it is worth your time and your money to fix it.  I’m devoting my whole life to fixing this problem.  I’m asking you to devote some of your resources to my life’s work too.”
Maybe it’s because:
1.    People think that asking for money is all about asking for money.  It is and it isn’t.  Most of the time it is about inspiring someone to see the world the way you do – with the same understanding of the problems and the same vision of how it can be overcome – and convincing them that you and your organization can actually make that vision into a reality.  The resources come second.
2.    People think that storytelling is a gift, not a skill.  Learning how to do this – to be an effective storyteller, to consistently connect with different people from different walks of life and convince them to see the world as you do and walk with you to a better future – is hard, but it’s a skill like any other.  It’s true that some people are born with it.  But it still can be learned and practiced, and if your nonprofit is going to succeed, you’d better have more than one or two people who can pull this off.
3.    Money = Power.  Our society has done a spectacular job of creating enormous amounts of wealth.  At the same time, wealth is associated with power, and not having wealth can feel like not having power.  So going to someone who has money and saying, “You have the resources, please give some of them to me” doesn’t feel like a conversation between equals.
How about this instead: “You are incredibly good at making money.  I’m incredibly good at making change.  The change I want to make in the world, unfortunately, does not itself generate much money.  But man oh man does it make change.  It’s a hugely important change.  And what I know about making this change is as good and as important as what you know about making money.  So let’s divide and conquer – you keep on making money, I’ll keep on making change. And if you can lend some of your smarts to the change I’m trying to make, well that’s even better.  But most of the time, we both keep on doing what we’re best at, and if we keep on working together the world will be a better place.”
4.    I’m terrified you’ll say ‘no.’ We all hate rejection.  Being rejected when asking for money is a double whammy.  You were already scared to ask, and then the person said no.  They have all the power.  You walk away, head down, empty hat in hand.
Get over it.  You’re still devoting your life to this work.  You shared an idea with someone.  You didn’t convince them today, but you probably got their attention.  Maybe you’ll convince them tomorrow.  Maybe they’ll tell a friend.  Maybe you learned something that will make your pitch better the next time.  At least you got your story out there to the right person.
You made a change – you just didn’t get any money in return.
I’ve met too many nonprofit CEOs who say “I hate fundraising.  I don’t fundraise.”  If you’re being hired as a nonprofit CEO and the Board tells you that you won’t be fundraising, they’re either misguided or lying.
Tell them they’re wrong.  Tell them that your job as a CEO is to be an evangelist for your idea and to convince others about the change you want to see in the world.  Tell them that if this idea is worth supporting then they should jump in with both feet and support it with their time and money and by telling their friends it is worth supporting.
Spending your time talking to powerful, influential people about the change you hope to see in the world is a pretty far cry from having fundraising as a “necessary evil.”
Do you really believe that the “real work” is JUST the “programs” you operate?  (the school you run; the meals you serve; the vaccines you develop; the patients you treat?)   Do you really believe that it ends there?  Do you really believe that in today’s world, where change can come from anyone and anywhere, that convincing people and building momentum and excitement and a movement really doesn’t matter?
Of course your programs or investments are real work.  But so is evangelizing, communicating, sharing, convincing, cajoling, and arm-twisting.  So are videos and images and stories and ideas.
If your ideas and programs and people and vision are so great, shouldn’t people be willing to reach into their pockets and fund them?   If it’s worth spending your life doing this work, shouldn’t you or someone in your organization be able to convince someone else that the work is worth supporting?
In the for-profit world, nothing happens if you don’t have a compelling product with a compelling story that wins out in the marketplace of ideas and gets people to act.  People get so excited about Apple’s products that they blog about the next release, scour the Internet for registered patents, spread ideas and rumors about what is coming next, and convince the people around them that Apple = cool.  Do you think this would happen without Steve Jobs living and breathing the brand each and every day?
So how is it that in the nonprofit sector we create this illusion that growth and change and impact can happen absent this kind of energy and engagement?
There’s this unspoken idea floating around that “fundraisers” can go about their work in a vacuum, having quiet, unimportant conversations with nameless, faceless rich people, while all the while the people who do the real work (the program folks) can go about their business, separate from and unconnected to this conversation.
What a waste.
Don’t you think that creating a tribe5 of connected, engaged, passionate evangelists for your cause will create a positive feedback loop that will amplify the change you hope to see in the world?  It doesn’t matter if that tribe is 300 powerful, smart, wealthy people or 3 million regular folks who believe in you and the change you hope to make.  If they are passionate and engaged and you give them a way to help, you will amplify your impact.
If nothing else, then, we need a new word.  Fundraising is about a transaction – I raise funds from you, you get nothing in return.
I’d rather be an evangelist, a storyteller, an educator, a translator, a table-pounder, a guy on his soap box, a woman with a megaphone, a candidate for change.  I want to talk to as many people as I can about my ideas – whether in person or in newsletters or on Facebook or Twitter or in the Economist or at the TED conference or at Davos – and capture their imagination about the change I hope to see in the world.

Waiting for the last drip,"Marketing is never about a hammer hitting plate glass.
It is almost always about the accrued power of a thousand drips, drips that accrue, drop by drop until they overwhelm the status quo and break through, starting a flood.
The first drip is very exciting, of course. Everyone lines up to cheer.
It’s the last drip that’s lonely. Most of the time, everyone has long left the building, lost interest and moved on to celebrate some other first drip. The penultimate drip gets criticized… are you still working on that?… that’s not so great… is that it?… but then, the drip that comes next, the last drip, proves once and for all that you were doing the right thing all along.","October 26, 2008","marketing, perseverance, momentum"
Your brand is not your logo,"Freshfueland theDielinepoint to some new logos from big players.
Cluelessness on the half shell.
Smart marketers understand that a new logo can’t possibly increase your market share, and they know that an expensive logo doesn’t defeat a cheap logo. They realize that the logo is like a first name, it’s an identifier.
So, when Pepsi and BestBuy start ‘testing’ logos, and proclaiming that a new logo might change their market share, I get nervous. You can’t test a logo any more than you can test a first name. Sure, you can eliminate Myxlplyx as an outlier, but given the success of the Starbucks mermaid and the Dunkin Donuts typeface (two outliers) you can see that this testing is sort of meaningless.
I guess the punchline is: take the time and money and effort you’d put into an expensive logo and put them into creating a product and experience and story that people remember instead.","October 25, 2008","brand identity, logo testing, marketing strategy"

Be careful of who you work for,"The single most important marketing decision most people make is also the one we spend precious little time on: where you work.
Think about this for a second. Your boss and your job determine not only what you do all day, but what you learn and who you interact with. Where you work is what you market. Work in a high stress place and you’re likely to become a highly stressed person, and your interactions will display that. Work for a narcissist and you’ll develop into someone who’s good at shining a light on someone else, not into someone who can lead. Work for someone who plays the fads and you’ll discover that instead of building a steadily improving brand, you’re jumping from one thing to another, enduring layoffs in-between gold rushes. Work for a bully and be prepared to be bullied.
And yet, there are plenty of books about getting a job, but no books I know of aboutchoosinga job. There are hundreds of sites where job seekers can go to find a new job, andvirtuallynone where you can find reviews of bosses or companies or jobs.
Ted Zoromski really needed a job, so he took one doing human spam (outbound telemarketing). That’s his first mistake. This isn’t a stepping stone to something better, it doesn’t teach you much, it grinds you down and it doesn’t make you more marketable. When he found he was also making calls he foundoffensive,he quit.
Years ago, when I had ten people working for me at my book packaging company, one client accounted for about half our revenue. They were difficult, constantly threatening litigation, sending lawyers to otherwise productive meetings, questioning our ethics and more. It was clearly the culture of their organization to be at war. So I fired them. I gave them the rights and walked away, even though it meant a huge hit to our organization. Why do it? Because if we had stuck with them, it would have changed who we were, who we hired and how we marketed ourselves going forward. We would have had a lifetime of this.
How many job offers with good pay have you turned down in your lifetime? How many clients? Compare that to how many times you’ve been rejected. That’s totally out of whack. Great marketing involves having a great product, and not every job (or every client) is worth your time or attention or love.

The sad truth about marketing shortcuts,"Here’s the thing: 4 ounces of plutonium are dangerous and expensive, but they won’t build an atomic bomb. And even if you get 400 ounces, you can’t build 100 bombs.
Critical mass is what happens when you have enough and do enough that you connect to a tribe, one that matters. Critical mass is the pay off from focused, consistent effort. Critical mass is what you don’t get if you are constantly working the angles and looking for a shortcut.
Open a small chain of restaurants before you’ve connected enough people to make your first restaurant standing room only won’t work. And online, the results are even more obvious.
After Squidoo gave away$80,000, we heard from many of the charities that sent a lot of their supporters over to vote. Do you know what they wanted to to know? ""When was the next time we can rally a lot of people to get more votes and donations?"" Do you know what not one of them asked?""How can we get our supporters to actually lay some groundwork so we can make this sort of money every week?""
It made me sad that so many non-profits have precisely the same mantra. Rush to the easy money, then look for more and rush after that.
Every day at Squidoo, thousands of people build pages. And most of them lose interest and fade away. But a few stick it out and many earn $2,000 or more a month in their spare time (for themselves or for charity). The difference is clear but sad. The shortcut didn’t work right away, so they’re off to the next thing.
If you have a presence on twitter, squidoo, blogs, facebook, myspace, linkedin and 20 other sites, the chances of finding critical mass at any of them is close to zero. But if you dominate, if you’re the goto person, the king of your hill, magical things happen. One follower in each of twenty places is worthless. Twenty connected followers in one place is a tribe. It’s the foundation for building something that matters.
This is why I don’t have a podcast, a video channel, any activity to speak of on Facebook. It’s why I don’t use Twitter or travel the country visiting bookstores. There are many places to be, and it’s tempting to act like those non-profits and race after the next one. But it doesn’t work.",,"marketing, critical mass, shortcuts"
Signaling strategies,"It’s impossible to see everyone. You can’t handle the input of what every consumer is buying or thinking or looking at. So, we resort to signaling strategies.
A few celebrities wearing Uggs in the middle of the summer sends a signal to fashion wannabees everywhere: these are hot. It doesn’t matter too much if they actuallyarehot, all that matters (to these wannabees and the retailers that serve them) is that in the past, when beautiful people in Santa Monica did something, it was an effective signal to the market.
There are all sorts of signaling strategies consumers look for. Political endorsements, end cap displays at stores, large scale ad campaigns, The New York Times bestseller list–each is seen as a bellwether for what our friends and those we admire are about to do.
Marketers may be selfish, but we’re not stupid. Once a signaling strategy is seen to be effective, we seek to game it. 25 years ago, driving cross country to go to my first day of work at Spinnaker Software (I was the 30th employee) I drove through Chicago. And I passed a Spinnaker billboard. Wow! This company was going somewhere if they had billboards all over the country. When I got to work in Boston two days later, I discovered that this was the one and only billboard they had in the country, strategically erected on the road to the big CES trade show. They were signaling the buyers of the big stores.
Various bestseller lists, because of their unwillingness to be transparent, is easily and often gamed by publishers and musicians and websites that focus their efforts on the sort of places that report to the list.
There are three reasons you need to care about the increasing amount of effort spent gaming the signals:1. As a consumer, don’t be fooled. The more important a signal is, the more likely it is that marketers are gaming it.2. As a signaler, be careful. As you sell out and permit yourself to be gamed, you make it more and more likely that consumers won’t be influenced by you.3. As a marketer, beware. The effort you expend gaming one signal or another is almost never worth the distortion that gaming produces. Instead of spending your time delighting authentic voices, you’re corrupting a signal. Which means that you end up being really good at signal corrupting but not so good at winning in your market. For every Uggs, there are 100 companies that spent too much money and time influencing a few, only to discover the market didn’t care.","October 22, 2008","Signaling strategies, market influence, consumer behavior"
This is not the time to ask for money,"I don’t know about you, but I’m getting plenty of emails asking for more money for various political campaigns.
That’s because the systems in place are good at asking for money, and that’s what they measure. They’re willing to burn out permission, person by person, just to squeeze out the last few bucks.
What a shame. What a waste.
Businesses do this all the time. So do non-profits. They get in a habit of doing one thing (pay, pay, pay!) and they forget that this has a real cost. Ask enough times and people will shut you out. And once they shut you out, you’re out forever.
My local radio station is once again drilling us with their pledge drive. Hey, if five days are good, why not twenty or fifty? Sooner or later, you just move on.
If I ran a campaign, I would immediately stop asking for money. I’d ask for ideas for what to do if I got elected. I’d ask for a house party to listen in on a conference call. I’d ask for names of possible voters or I’d look for volunteers to drive to the polls. I’d get petitions signed or ask people to prioritize six ideas for the rest of the campaign or for things to work on after I got elected.

Too small to fail,"One secret of being a large financial institution is that you can take huge risks because you’re too big to fail. If you hit craps and lose it all, don’t worry, because you’ll get bailed out.
One secret of‘small is the new big‘ thinking is that you won’t fail and you can’t fail and you don’t need to worry about a bailout. Not because you’re small in headcount or assets, but because you act small.
A small acting bank would never have invested in tens of thousands of loans that they hadn’t looked at. And a small acting startup wouldn’t hire dozens of people before they had a business model… and then have to lay off a third of them just because their VC firm showed them a scary PowerPoint.
I’ve always been frightened by big-firm accounting. The sort of financial legerdemain in which skilled accountants work hard to make the numbers look the way the CEO wants, instead of making them clear. Cash accounting run on a simple bookkeeping system is the small way to do it… even if your company is huge. That’s because sooner or later, management has to know what’s actually happening as opposed to what they can pretend is happening.
Big-thinking companies lose customers all the time because big-thinking companies isolate the decision makers from the outside world. Angry customers who are leaving don’t get heard… that news is heard by the poor shlub reading a script at the call center. 90% of the angry customer mail that people forward to me (I have enough for a lifetime, thanks) is angry because the (former) customer is tired of being ignored.
If you act small and think big, you are too small to fail. You won’t need a bailout because your business makes sense each and every day. You won’t need a bailout because your flat organization (no matter how large it is) knows about problems long before they’re too big to deal with.
The media and the tech blogs glamorize businesses that act big. They write about the big checks VCs hand out and they lionize the organizations that make a splash. The untold story is in the organizations that are close to the customer, close to the product and close to each other. Acting small always pays off.

Is that it?,"""Is that it?""
This state of ennui explains why we’ll never run out of remarkable, why consumers are restless, why successful people keep working and taking risks. It explains the self-centered, whiny attitude of some bloggers who can never get enough from the world, and it explains why a rich country like the US could almost bankrupt itself in search of ever more.
I’m not saying that consumers don’t deserve respect and quality in exchange for their attention. I’m pointing out that we make ourselves unhappy just for the sport of it.
Marketers have played into this attitude and certainly amplified it. It helps them to gain share, of course, but also raises the bar on what they’re going to have to do next.
As a marketer or a leader, you have two choices:
The first is to realize that people will never ever be satisfied with you, they’ll even whine when you give away something for free. Embrace the whining and realize that this attitude gives you an opportunity to answer the question with, ""no! Wait, there’s more!""
The second is to understand that a hug and a smile from a true friendisit.Along the way, marketers of stuff have tried to offer that stuff as a replacement to the thing that children/consumers/employees/customers/spouses really seek, which is connection and meaning and belonging and love.","October 20, 2008","Ennui, Consumerism, Connection"
Do you have 16 boxes?,"Your career is not a boat. Neither is your business.
A boat with even a small leak is going to sink. You, on the other hand, don’t need to be perfect to succeed. Imagine that you have a 4 x 4 grid to fill with assets. If it’s a business, it might be location, reputation, staff, offerings that are in high demand and a sector that’s robust… if you’re doing it for yourself, it might include your resume, your network, your skill set, etc.
When someone chooses you or your products, they’re considering everything you have to offer. Whether you’re looking for a job or trying to make a sale, there is rarely only one thing that makes the difference.
That’s why human nature is so enraging. When something is going wrong, when the economy is out of sync, we panic. We obsess about just one of the sixteen boxes and ignore the others. We talk ourselves into hysteria about how, ""none of our customers have any money,"" or, ""in this bleak economy, we’ll never make a sale."" Instead of using the relative downtime to build up the other 15 boxes, we just sit in the corner, keening, worrying about that one box that’s out of whack.
By focusing on the red box, the sore one, and ignoring the other elements of what makes our product or career worth marketing, we cause two problems. First, our attention does no good at all on the problem at hand, and second, the other boxes suffer.
The problem with whining is this: human beings like to be right. If you persuade yourself and your friends that times are really tough and that you’re bound to fail, you’ll probably do the things you need to do to make that true in the long run.","October 19, 2008","career, business, mindset"

Best of one world,"As always, the truth lies in the cliches.
""Having the best of both worlds"" is something that marketers shoot for all the time. They want the traffic that a community site will give them, but they also want the control they get by only having authorized employees participating. They shoot for their favorite parts, and get nothing. Always nothing.
Instead, perhaps it’s worth hoping for the best of one world.
Compromise, by its nature, means giving up part of one thing to get part of something else. So you end up with a little of this and a little of that. The low fat of prunes and the shelf appeal of a cupcake. Sounds good on paper, but when given the choice, the diet conscious will pick a real prune and the gluttons will pick a real cupcake. And you’re left with an overstock situation.
When in doubt, maximize.",,"Best of one world, compromise, maximize"
Leadership is now the strongest marketing strategy,"Yelling with gusto used to be the best way to advertise your wares. There was plenty of media and if you had plenty of money, you were set.
Today, of course, yelling doesn’t work so well.
What works is leading. Leading a (relatively) small group of people. Taking them somewhere they’d like to go. Connecting them to one another.
I say relatively because there are few products that needeveryonein order to succeed. A tiny sliver of the market is enough. Bill Niman used to run Niman Ranch, a cooperative raising meat for fancy restaurants and markets. That was already a sliver of the huge huge market for meat. He moved on to start BN, a 1000 acre farm raising goats for a subset of that subset. It’s enough.
It’s enough if thetribeyou lead knows about you and cares about you and wants to follow you. It’s enough if your leadership changes things, galvanizes the audience and puts the status quo under stress. And it’s enough if the leadership you provide makes a difference.
Go down the list of online success stories. The big winners are organizations that give tribes of people a platform to connect.
Go down the list of fashion businesses or business to business organizations. Same thing. Charities, too. Churches, certainly.
It’s so tempting to believe that we are merely broadcasters, putting together a play list and hurtling it out to the rest of the world. Louder is better. But we’re not. Now we’re leaders.

The rapid growth (and destruction) and growth of marketing,"Hand selling
Mass marketing-Billboards-Newspaper ads-Radio ads-TV ads-Banner ads
Direct marketing-Direct mail-Coupons-Spam
Viral marketing
Permission marketing-email-relevant text ads
Is there a pattern here? Marketing had an arc, one that started with personal, local interactions between real people and rapidly morphed into very corporate anonymous actions aimed at the unwilling masses. Charlie the Tuna is humorous, but he only existed to sell tuna, not to improve our lives.
Mass marketing created an angry, selfish beast, a hungry one, one that demanded to be fed. So marketers fed it, they fed it with any ads they could find. And when they couldn’t find ads, they spammed us. All in the name of commerce, all because they’re doing their job.
If this blog had existed twenty years ago, every single marketer reading it would have been a mass marketer, a direct marketer or a spammer. All day, every day. In the last ten years, the arc switched its trajectory and the selfish nature of marketing started to unravel.
The web led topermission marketing, which throws a monkey wrench into the selfish rationalization of marketers. Ads that went to people who wanted them outperformed (50:1) ads aimed at strangers. Suddenly, respect becomes profitable.
Wait! What about reaching new people? What about growth? Enter theideavirus.Viral marketing, remarkable products, word of mouth online… all of these tactics are part of the same strategy: ideas that spread, win. If the internet is a giant meme machine, spreading ideas further and faster than ever before, the winners are those organizations that make things worth talking about. Apurple cowisn’t a fancy gimmick, or something you slap on to last year’s item. A purple cow is a remarkable story, a story that spreads.
Social media’s growth in the last three years, though, gives marketers an inkling that there may be something else going on. Sure, they can runspamads on Facebook, but they don’t work.Social media, it turns out, isn’t about aggregating audiences so you can yell at them about the junk you want to sell.Social media, in fact, is a basic human need, revealed digitally online. We want to be connected, to make a difference, to matter, to be missed. We want to belong, and yes, we want to be led.
My new book is calledTribesand it comes out today. I started to write a leadership book but discovered that I was actually writing a marketing book. (Either that, or I started to write a marketing book and ended up writing about leadership, I can’t remember). Either way, what I discovered in writing it is this: The next frontier of marketing is in leading groups of people who are working together to get somewhere.
As someone who was buying millions of dollars of magazine ads just 24 years ago, this is a lot of change to swallow. And it’s also the biggest opportunity for good/meaning/success that I can imagine. More details arehere.
Things have changed, far more dramatically than most people realize. Not just what marketers buy, but what the media does all day, and what marketers build, and what we get paid to do and what and where we pay attention…
Here’s the wager: A year from now, 10/16/09, will you be leading a tribe of people? Will you be creating stories, connecting people, giving them a platform and making things better for people who care about each other?

Well, quite a few people joined in, and about 10% became seriously active. On good days, there’s a new post every minute or two. There are hundreds of groups, thousands of discussions and a lot of energy.

The group remains closed, but feel free to start one of your own.

Maybe you can’t make money doing what you love,"The thing is, it’s far easier than ever before to surface your ideas. Far easier to have someone notice your art or your writing or your photography. Which means that people who might have hidden their talents are now finding them noticed…
That blog you’ve built, the one with a lot of traffic… perhaps it can’t be monetized.
That non-profit you work with, the one where you are able to change lives… perhaps turning it into a career will ruin it.
That passion you have for art… perhaps making your painting commercial enough to sell will squeeze the joy out of it.
When what you do is what you love, you’re able to invest more effort and care and time. That means you’re more likely to win, to gain share, to profit. On the other hand, poets don’t get paid. Even worse, poets that try to get paid end up writing jingles and failing and hating it at the same time.
Today, there are more ways than ever to share your talents and hobbies in public. And if you’re driven, talented and focused, you may discover that the market loves what you do. That people read your blog or click on your cartoons or listen to your mp3s. But, alas, that doesn’t mean you can monetize it, quit your day job and spend all day writing songs.
The pitfalls:1. In order to monetize your work, you’ll probably corrupt it, taking out the magic in search of dollarsand2. Attention doesn’t always equal significant cash flow.
I think it makes sense to make your art your art, to give yourself over to it without regard for commerce.
Doing what you love is as important as ever, but if you’re going to make a living at it, it helps to find a niche where money flows as a regular consequence of the success of your idea. Loving what you do is almost as important as doing what you love, especially if you need to make a living at it. Go find a job you can commit to, a career or a business you can fall in love with.
A friend who loved music, who wanted to spend his life doing it, got a job doing PR for a record label. He hated doing PR, realized that just because he was in the record business didn’t mean he had anything at all to do with music. Instead of finding a job he could love, he ended up being in proximity to, but nowhere involved with, something he cared about. I wish he had become a committed school teacher instead, spending every minute of his spare time making music and sharing it online for free. Instead, he’s a frazzled publicity hound working twice as many hours for less money and doing no music at all.
Maybe you can’t make money doing what you love (at least what you love right now). But I bet you can figure out how to love what you do to make money (if you choose wisely).
Do your art. But don’t wreck your art if it doesn’t lend itself to paying the bills. That would be a tragedy.
(And the twist, because there is always a twist, is that as soon as you focus on your art and leave the money behind, you may just discover that this focus turns out to be the secret of actually breaking through and making money.)","October 15, 2008","monetization, passion, art"

What does this remind you of?,"Every time you visit a new website, enter a new airport, visit a new store, examine a new book… the question you ask first off is, ""what’s this like?""
At a strange airport, if it’s ‘like’ your airport, you know just what to do. It’s easy. If it’s totally different, you have to stop, regroup, and start to understand what’s involved.
If a book has cheap color separations, the wrong sort of gloss on the cover and the wrong hue to the paper, it just feels cheap and self-published and unlikely to be the real deal. It doesn’t matter a bit what’s inside, who wrote it, anything. You’ve already decided because this book reminds you of untrustworthy books you’ve encountered before.
Visit a website with a brown on brown color scheme, a stock photo of a nautilus, some flashing graphics, a bunch of widgets and a typeface that’s not quite right, and you’ve already decided how you feel. Entirely based on the fact thatthissite is likethosesites, and you didn’t like those sites.
Meet someone at a conference who is dressed perfectly, with shined shoes and a great suit (but not trying too hard) and you’re inclined to trust and respect him… because he reminds you of someone in a similar situation who was trustworthy.
Obvious, right?
So why do marketers so often miss this shortcut? Before you make what you’re going to make, find something you want people to be reminded of. Feel free to discard this model if you want to make a point (the ipod did not remind you of a Sony CD player), but discard it on purpose. If you’re writing a book, for example,  your goal (probably) isn’t to reinvent what it means to be a book. You’re merely trying to reinvent the words and ideas. So when it comes to the jacket and the type, steal relentlessly. Your audience will thank you, because it’s one less thing to process.
When in doubt, ask your colleagues, ""what does this remind you of?""","October 13, 2008","perception, branding, familiarity"
Rock stars,"A bonus quote for a Sunday afternoon:
A rock star is not someone who takes the temperature, who gauges themarketplace before he creates his ""art"".  A rock star is someone whoneeds to create and is willing to tolerate the haters along with thefans.  He’s someone who incites controversy just by existing.  That’swhat we lost in the dash for cash.  Unique voices.  I’m not saying wehaven’t ended up with some pleasant music, but it just hasn’t hit youin the gut, it’s the aural equivalent of Splenda, it might do thetrick, but it’s not the real thing.  The real thing grabs yourattention, drives down deep into your heart and lodges itself there.  Arock star doesn’t follow conventions, doesn’t go disco or add drummachines just because everybody else does.  A rock star exists in hisown unique space, and if you met him you probably wouldn’t like him.Because he tends to be self-focused to the point of beingnarcissistic.  Because he cares.  He needs to get his message out.
Dilemma: This is a quote fromBob Lefsetz(his blog is profane, direct and will make some people uncomfortable). Bob is, in fact, a rock star. But it’s his blog, not yours, and you should only read it if you want to be provoked. And you shouldn’t read it if it bothers you to read things online that you disagree with. Some people will be upset by Bob’s blog, which means that they’ll be upset by my quoting any part of it. At some point, though, the web comes down to bumping into things we might disagree with. That’s my favorite part. It’s where the learning happens.","October 12, 2008","Rock stars, controversy, creativity"
Bowling 300,"Last week, I had interactions with two organizations that did exactly what they said they would do. Thanks to Brad and his team atCatalystand to Christoper Justice atSparkskight. Neither asked or expected anything in return, they just did great work.
There are very few endeavors where perfect is possible (bowling is one, of course). It turns out that when you take on a complex task like putting on a conference or shooting a video, you won’t deliver perfect. 300 is a random event, not something achievable.
In those situations (which means most of the time for most of us) the question is, ""what do you do when things don’t go exactly the way you planned a month ago?"" And it turns out that if your bias is to always make it right, to use grace and flair to overdeliver at every turn, you’ve just discovered the single most important secret of marketing.

Everyone isn’t going to be a leader. But everyone isn’t going to be successful, either.
Success is now the domain of people who lead. That doesn’t mean they’re in charge, it doesn’t mean they are the CEO, it merely means that for a group, even a small group, they show the way, they spread ideas, they make change.

Waiting until the last hour,"I figure that the cliche was never, ""the last hour,"" but for a long time, it was, ""waiting until the last minute."" In our ever-faster society, now we wait for the last second.
Of course we do. Why shouldn’t we? The last second eliminates the need to make a decision, most of the time, because the last second doesn’t arrive, thus saving us the angst. And when we do take action, there’s no penalty (usually) for waiting.
Airlines and others penalize people for planning ahead by instituting non-refundable fares. We don’t get treated like royalty for signing up early, and the penalties for waiting often seem fairly small.
In Florida, on the other hand, where dinner is half price before 5 pm, the restaurants are often packed.
Every time I’ve posted a job or an offer with a deadline, I get amazingly well-written and thoughtful notes one day after the deadline has passed, begging for another chance, or quoting time zones or some other sort of nonsense. Of course, it’s all because we’ve persuaded ourselves to wait till the last second.

The plight (and the pox) of the undecided,"After Tuesday’s debate, one study of undecided voters showed that 35% of them considered the outcome of the debate a tie.
A tie?
I can imagine believing that Obama won. I can concede that some people thought McCain won. But a tie? How could a rational person call it a tie?
Of course, they didn’t really mean it was a tie. Just like the prospects who don’t buy your stuff but don’t say no aren’t really in search of more information so they can make a considered decision.
Here’s the formula of what’s really happening:
Fear of making a decision > Benefit of making a decision.
And that, for marketers, is the pox of the undecided. We think that people are undecided because they don’t know enough about our features or our competitors, or because they don’t have enough money or they are waiting to hear from their friends. In fact, most of the time, they’re undecided because they are afraid of deciding.Nois scary andyesis scary.
The reason that so many people don’t vote is the same as the reason that so many people walk past your store every day or click past your site every day. Because inertia is compelling. Inertia absolves them of responsibility.
Forewarned is forearmed. Now that you know that your competition is called inertia, you can sell against it more effectively. A ticking clock is a marketer’s best friend.

Is effort a myth?,"People really want to believe effort is a myth, at least if we consider what we consume in the media:
It really seems (at least if you read popular media) that who you know and whether you get ‘picked’ are the two keys to success. Luck.
The thing about luck is this: we’re already lucky. We’re insanely lucky that we weren’t born during the black plague or in a country with no freedom. We’re lucky that we’ve got access to highly-leveraged tools and terrific opportunities. If we set that luck aside, though, something interesting shows up.
Delete the outliers–the people who are hit by a bus or win the lottery, the people who luck out in a big way, and we’re left with everyone else. And for everyone else, effort is directly related to success. Not all the time, but as much as you would expect. Smarter, harder working, better informed and better liked people do better than other people, most of the time.
Effort takes many forms. Showing up, certainly. Knowing stuff (being smart might be luck of the draw, but knowing stuff is the result of effort). Being kind when it’s more fun not to. Paying forward when there’s no hope of tangible reward. Doing the right thing. You’ve heard these things a hundred times before, of course, but I guess it’s easier to bet on luck.
If people aren’t betting on luck, then why do we make so many dumb choices? Why aren’t useful books selling at fifty times the rate they sell now? Why does anyone, ever, watch reality TV shows? Why do people do such dumb stuff with their money?
I think we’ve been tricked by the veneer of lucky people on the top of the heap. We see the folks who manage to skate by, or who get so much more than we think they deserve, and it’s easy to forget that:
a. these guys are the exceptionsandb. there’s nothing you can do about it anyway.
And that’s the key to the paradox of effort: While luck may be more appealing than effort, you don’t get to choose luck. Effort, on the other hand, is totally available, all the time.
This is a hard sell. Diet books that say, ""eat less, exercise more,"" may work, but they don’t sell many copies.
With that forewarning, here’s a bootstrapper’s/marketer’s/entrepreneur’s/fast-rising executive’s effort diet. Go through the list and decide whether or not it’s worth it. Or make up your own diet. Effort is a choice, at least make it on purpose:
1. Delete 120 minutes a day of ‘spare time’ from your life. This can include TV, reading the newspaper, commuting, wasting time in social networks and meetings. Up to you.
2. Spend the 120 minutes doing this instead:
3. Spend at least one weekend day doing absolutely nothing but being with people you love.
4. Only spend money, for one year, on things you absolutely need to get by. Save the rest, relentlessly.
If you somehow pulled this off, then six months from now, you would be the fittest, best rested, most intelligent, best funded and motivated person in your office or your field. You would know how to do things other people don’t, you’d have a wider network and you’d be more focused.
It’s entirely possible that this won’t be sufficient, and you will continue to need better luck. But it’s a lot more likely you’ll get lucky, I bet.","October 8, 2008","effort, luck, success"
Making it real by making it closer,"Items in the future are closer than they appear.
If you’re going across town, you’re very specific: ""188 Fifth Avenue, on the east side of the street please.""
On the other hand, when you go on vacation, you tell people, ""I’m going to Paris,"" not ""we’re going to 8 rue du Cherche-Midi."" And if you’re going even farther than that, you skip the city and country altogether and just say, ""we’re going to Africa."" One day, Richard Branson will take you all the way to Mars–all you get is the name of the planet.
This makes sense, of course. We don’t need to know which crater you’re going to, just that it’s far away.
Marketers spend a lot of time describing a future and making it real. The more general you are in describing it, the farther away people imagine it is. ""We’re going to launch a new product next year"" sounds a lot more distant than handing someone a prototype and saying, ""this launches on January 3rd at 2 pm at CES.""

Nine steps to Powerpoint magic,"Perhaps you’ve experienced it. You do a presentation and it works. It works! That’s the reason we keep coming back for more, that’s why so many of us spend more time building and giving presentations than almost anything else we do.
Here are some steps to achieve this level of PPT nirvana (Your mileage may vary. These are steps, not rules):
Most presentations (and I’ve seen a lot) are absolutely horrible. They’re not horrible because they weren’t designed by a professional, they’re horrible because they are delivered by someone who is hiding what they came to say. The new trend of tweaking your slides with expensive graphic design doesn’t solve this problem, it makes it worse. Give me an earnest amateur any day, please.","October 6, 2008","Powerpoint, presentation, communication"
Kinds of people,"Some people want to do things because they are interesting.Some people want to do things because they work.Some people want to do things because everyone else is doing them.
And some people are satisfied/scared/shy/lazy and don’t do anything.
Think about blogging or buying a new pair of shoes or voting for a candidate or picking one career over another. Different people have very different agendas. The key in understanding someone’s actions is understanding their agenda.
That salesperson who does everything by the book is not interested in the thrill of discovery. That retired steel worker that is hesitating to vote for your candidate is wondering what everyone else is going to do. And that unpredictable blogger keeps changing the rules because the rules bore him.","October 5, 2008","motivation, actions, agendas"
Look for the guy with a hammer,"The old adage is that for someone with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
It’s a warning that people who are only good at one thing often believe that the one thing is the answer to every problem. And it’s a good warning.
But what if you’ve decided that in fact, a hammer is exactly the tool that will solve your problem? My advice: hire a guy who only uses a hammer. Odds are, he’s pretty good at it.
If you need cognitive behavioral therapy (the technique proven most effective for many conditions), don’t go to a therapist who does six different kinds of therapy, as needed. Go to someone who has only one tool, but uses it beautifully.
Don’t go to this person for advice about what sort of therapy you need. You need a generalist for that. Go to this person for her hammer.
If you want a piece of handmade furniture made with hand tools and hand finishes, get it from a craftsman who owns no power tools. And think twice before buying SEO services from a general purpose ad agency.
It sounds like I’m endorsing specialists, but that’s not really what I’m doing. What I’m proposing is that when you’re forced to choose (as opposed to mix or compromise) your tactics, it pressures you to make better stuff and to make better choices.
This is why the Journal’s report that Google is flirting seriously with a big advertising buy is so troublesome. Once you start buying TV time, you just added another tool to your marketing belt. Now, plenty of your development and marketing team will say, ""Oh, we’ll just buy ads. People will use it!"" Suddenly, you don’t focus so much on building word of mouth and remarkability into your products, because now you can easily use TV to spackle over less remarkable products.
Bad news for an organization that’s so good at one thing (building remarkable products that spread virally) to start pivoting into an area where they’re likely to be not-so-good. This will lead to TV-friendly products that aren’t viral, along with ads that aren’t quite good enough to make them pop. By diversifying their toolset, they’ll get less good at their core skill.
Choosing your marketing tactics drives the products you design just as much as the products you design choose your tactics. By having the discipline to run no TV ads, Google forces the organization to use the hammer they’re really good at. More tools isn’t always better.","October 4, 2008","specialization, marketing, tools"
Taking photographs vs. giving photographs,"Things flip.
Many cultures long viewed photographs with fear, worrying that a piece of the soul disappeared when a photo was taken.
Today, celebrities hire publicists who have no other job but to get their photographs to appear in print.
Oprah doesn’t pay authors to appear on her show, they pay publicists for the privilege… even though they are ""giving away"" all the ideas in their book for free.
It’s a tricky line to walk. Perhaps this pastry shop on Rodeo Drive is concerned that competitors will take photos of all the pastries and then copy them. Of course, all the competitor has to do isbuya pastry, so I’m not sure that’s a real problem. Some museums forbid all photography, even without a flash, for no other reason than fear. Clearly a famous painting is worth more than an unknown one–and just as clearly, the artist who painted the image probably wanted other people to see it.
This is a hard flip for people to make. Largely it’s about control. It’s your pastry, after all. A long time ago, bakers gave up trying to stop people from taking free smells of their labor. I wonder if they benefit by letting people (begging people) to take free photos?","October 3, 2008","photographs, control, culture"
When you stand for something,"People and brands and organizations that stand for something benefit as a result. Standing for something helps you build trust, makes it easier to manage expectations and aids in daily decision making. Standing for something also makes it more fun to do your gig, because you’re on a mission, doing something that matters. Of course, there’s a cost. You can’t get something for nothing.
It’s frustrating to watch marketers, politicians and individuals fall into the obvious trap of trying to stand for something at the same time they try to please everyone or do everything.
You can’t be the low-price, high-value, wide-selection, convenient, green, all-in-one corner market. Sorry.
You also can’t be the high-ethics CEO who just this one time lets an accounting fraud slide. ""Because it’s urgent.""
You can’t be the big-government-fighting, low-taxes-for-everyone, high-services-for-everyone, safety-net, pro-science, faith-based, anti-deficit candidate either.
You can’t be the work-smart, life-in-balance, available-at-all-hours, high-output, do-what-you’re-told employee.
To really stand for something, you must make difficult decisions, mostly about what you don’t do. We don’t ship products like that, we don’t stand for employees like that (""you’re fired""), we don’t fix problems like that.
It’s so hard to stand up, to not compromise, to give up an account or lose a vote or not tell a journalist what they want to hear.
But those are the only moments where standing for something actually counts, the only times that people will actually come to believe that you in fact actually stand for something.
If you have to change your story because your audience is different (oh, I’m on national TV today!) (oh, this big customer wants me to cut some key corners) you’re going to get caught. That’s because the audience is now unknown to you, everything is public sooner or later, and if you want to build a brand for the ages, you need to stand for something today and tomorrow and every day.","October 2, 2008","Standing for something, Trust, Commitment"

An iphone app that could change the way you get to work,"[Update: since I posted this two days ago, I've gotten dozens of notes about systems in the UK, Australia and around the world that people say are ""almost but not quite what you're describing."" I also got a few notes pointing out that this was impossible and would never be done. Go figure.]
[New update! Matt points out that Apple has stolen this idea and applied for apatent.]
In 2000, I invented a gadget called RadaR. Fred Wilson told me that I was ahead of my time, and he was right.
RadaR.com was a hardware/internet hybrid that could eliminate boatloads of traffic (and frustration). The idea is this: traffic reports are useless, because they tell you about places where you don't want to go and because they don't help you make smart choices. Have you ever once been on the Father Baker Bridge? Me either. I don't care if it's closed.
When I go to the airport, I have a choice of three bridges. Which one should I take? If a smart friend was in a helicopter, she could call me and say, ""don't take the Triboro (RFK)! Take the Whitestone…""
They never say that on the radio. ""Hey Seth, don't go that way!""
Well, with GPS and a little spectrum, we could fix this problem in a clever way.
You get a box a little bigger than a pack of Altoids. There are four big red buttons on top and a serial number on the bottom. Type your serial number into radar.com then put in addresses for the four buttons (the airport, work, your grandma's house and Philadelphia, say). Then, whenever you get in the car, hit the button for where you want to go. The device speaks to you and tells you which route to take.
Here's the killer part: the way it knows which way to go is that everyone driving along with a RadaR device is consistently uploading two pieces of data: where they're going and how long it is taking to get there.
Since RadaR central has thousands of cars in every city, it knows which routes are fast and which ones are slow. Crunching some numbers, it realizes that the Whitestone is totally jammed and can send people over the Throgs instead.
I was going to seed the market by giving RadaR devices to taxi drivers, so we'd have plenty of data points from the beginning.
The challenge is that getting this much hardware to so many people is expensive. Not to mention the bandwidth.
You probably already guessed the punchline: Do it with an iPhone.
Have the iPhone use the gps data… upload where I was a minute ago and where I am now. Figure out my speed and route. Use the data to tell other RadaR users which route is best. It's worth $20 a month if you live in a place with traffic jams. It's a natural monopoly–once someone figures it out, why wouldn't everyone want to use the market leader?
I minimize the difficulty of technology implementation (and I'm usually right). So don't tell me why it's impossible to do this, just build it and I'll buy one. If you build it, let me know.
BONUS! Here's an easier one that you could probably sell as well. I type in a phone number and enter a time. Record a message and press go. I can cue up a bunch of messages that are based on time. I can have groups get the message I record, at the time I want them to get it. I can make announcements… For example, if the sign in at the gym starts at 6 am, I can set my phone and it will call ahead and sign me in. Or you could ping your exec team every morning at 8 on their way into work…","November 30, 2008","iPhone app, traffic solution, RadaR"
Creating a clearance sale culture,"If you want to avoid being stuck with inventory or downtime during a recession, you might profit from realizing that people tell themselves a different story when they go to buy something.
During good times, we wonder, ""can I get this house before the price goes up or someone else snatches it?"" or we think, ""my time is really valuable, it’s okay if this is a little more expensive than the store down the street."" Businesses think about getting the invoices in before budget closes, or making the boss happy.
In our current times, people tell themselves the story, ""I got a steal!"" If it’s not a steal, they wait.
You can’t just lower all the prices in your operation. There are two reasons this doesn’t work. First, you no longer communicate the story of ‘special deal’, instead you communicate ‘we’re in trouble.’ Second, you end up chargingeveryonea lower price, even the people who were happy to pay more–who wanted to pay more, in fact.
Important distinction: if you say to someone, ""if I give you a discount, will you buy it?"" the answer will almost certainly be no. No, because lowering the price is almost never sufficient to change non-interest into interest.
So, empower your staff, all of them, to take 10% off the price of anything if someone asks or seems concerned. ""Oh, don’t worry. I’ll just take $20 off the price of the room if you can book it now."" For retailers or personal selling situations, you can give your staff a pile of ""manager’s coupons"" that they can just whip out… peel one off and quietly hand it to the waffling customer. It needs to have a date on it, probably hand written. Even better, let them write in the discount (up to x%, and of course they’ll always write x, which is fine, because that’s what you planned on.)
Is this something youwantto do? Probably not. Almost certainly not. But it might be something you have to do. The alternative are shoppers who walk out of the store and leave you with nothing.","November 29, 2008","clearance sale, pricing strategy, customer engagement"
Don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone,"IWantSandyis folding, as are a number of web companies. So is that restaurant you loved down the street. Users are outraged. Outraged!
When you find a service or establishment or product that gives you joy, it’s tempting to keep it to yourself. Perhaps it’s uncomfortable to recommend it to a friend (after all, you might seem silly) and even more uncomfortable to recommend it to a stranger (after all, you might seem like a shill).
Plenty of people hesitate before spreading the word about a political candidate or a business or amedical device. We’re worried that we’ll look silly, or that the place will end up being too crowded and now we won’t be able to get in. Or perhaps we’re concerned about losing our uniqueness…
Anyway, the outcry that accompanies the closing of one of these businesses should be enough to remind you that your hesitation has a cost.

Thanksgiving,"This has always been my favorite holiday. No gifts, no guilt, no doctrine.
For me, the holiday celebrates people who contribute with no expectation of anything in return. Online, the rules are no different. There are plenty of people typing as fast they can, all in expectation of what they’ll get in return for that link or that shoutout or that flame. And then there are the superstars, the folks who have found a great platform for generosity.
Why be generous?
Why go out of your way for someone who can’t possibly pay you back?
I hope the answer is obvious. It is to me. The benefit is in the fact that theycan’tpay you back. The opportunity to instruct or assist when you can gain nothing in return is priceless. It creates meaning and momentum and structure.

3. Don’t buy from big brands or big stores that don’t care about you, or that act in ways you don’t applaud. There are very smartalternativesin almost every category.
4. When in doubt, buy digital items. Even better, give adonationand make many people happy.

Death of the personal blog?,"A quick look at thelistof the ‘top’ blogs in the world will show you that almost all of them are written by teams of people. There isn’t one in the top 10 that’s personal.
The best way to increase your ranking as a blogger is to postvery often and to have teams of people doing the work. If that’s yourstrategy, of course you can’t have it be a solo blog. The strategy for showing up on this list is to have lots and lots of posts, so your tactic needs to be to have a team of people doing the work.
Personal blogs aren’t going anywhere, though. There’s a difference between a blog about YOU (I call this acatblog) and a blog about the reader. Guy Kawasaki’s blog, and my blog for thatmatter, are not about us, about what we ate yesterday or how great weare. They are about you, the reader.
I guess there’s an easy analogy:Your blog could be like a newspaper (written by a staff)or it could be like a book (written by an author)
9 times out of 10, newspapers outsell books. No surprise. But they’re different. And we need both.
Who cares that you’re not writing a mass market newspaper? The point is not to show up on a list, the point is to start a conversation that spreads, to share ideas and to chronicle your thinking. That’s the work of an author, and I think rather than kissing author blogs goodbye, someone should just start a new list.",,"personal blogs, team blogging, content strategy"
The You Show,"A friend was telling me about some job interviews she went on. She enjoyed them.
Of course she did, I thought. She was starring in a show, a show about her.
Iwroteabout this five months ago, but it’s worth boiling it down to the interview or sales call level.
One approach is to be reactive, to sit where you’re supposed to sit, have your resume appear just so, wear what you’re supposed to wear and answer each and every question in the safe and secure way.
The other approach is to put on a show. To be in charge, to lead.
When you go to Las Vegas, Penn and Teller don’t ask you what sort of lights you want, what tricks you want to see and how long the show should be. They put on their show. If you don’t like it, that’s fine. Plenty of other people do. As a result, they win. They get to do their work, their way. And they profit from their confidence.

How to answer the phone,"The KitchenAid tea kettle (adorned in bright Squidoo orange, of course) in my office melted, leaving hot orange plastic on my thumb. Yes, it hurts as much as you probably imagine it does.
But that wasn’t the worst part.
I called 1-800-334-6889 to whine a little bit and to hear why they made a meltable teapot. I counted how many prompts I had to press in order to talk to a human being. It was NINE.
Nine! Try it. I’ll wait.
The last step was a recording that they were closed and I should call back after 10 am. Click.
I know you’ve heard this before, but it’s really simple:
The only reason to answer the phone when a customer calls is to make the customer happy.
If you’re not doing this or you are unable to do this,do not answer the phone. There is no middle ground on this discussion. There are no half measures. Saving 50 cents a call with a complicated phone tree is a false savings. Think of all the money you’ll save if you just stop answering altogether.

All of which is a way of warning you about [a potential pitfall of] microblogging (Twitter, etc.). If you’ve got 140 characters to make your point, the odds are you are going to be misunderstood (a lot). There may be nothing wrong with that, but you should be prepared for it to happen.

I’m not throwing the baby of microblogging out with the bathwater… I’m merely pointing out that the medium has to be appropriate for the message. Using microblogging (like Yammer) to share your quarterly review or to fire someone or to make an important, nuanced announcement is just sort of dumb.

Watching the Times struggle (and what you can learn),"Page by page, section by section, the influence of the New York Times is fading away. Great people on an important mission, but their footprint is shrinking and the company is losing stock value and cash and power and the ability to have the impact that they might.
Today’s Sunday magazine has a cover story on Jennifer Aniston. Of course!
""All the News That’s Fit to Print"" is the heart of the problem. It was never that, of course. It was ""All the News That Fits."" The entire mindset of (every) newspaper has been driven by the cost of paper, the finite nature of paper, the cost of delivery and the cycle of a daily paper. You run enough articles to fit as many ads as you can sell.These are artifacts of a different age, one that today’s consumer doesn’t care a whit about.
Lots of organizations go through this analysis. How do you leverage your brand or your customer base to get to the next level, to enter new markets or new technologies–and do it while running your old business. And almost without exception, organizations are run by people who want to protect the old business, not develop the new one.
When you think about your business, realize that it is a combination of assets and constraints. The Times understood both, but suddenly, the constraints changed. Now, it’s possible for a single individual with a Typepad account to reach more people than almost any newspaper in the country can. Loosen one constraint and the game changes. That leaves you with the assets, for a while anyway.
When in pain, the answer is not to pander to the masses and undo the very things that made you special.
Ten years ago, the paper knew what it had to do. They had a shot at inventing the future, but compromised their way to it instead of leading. Here are some simple ways they could think big instead of merely failing to defend the status quo:
1. Use their influence and brand to enable users to spread their content:Why, precisely, aren’t the Zagats guides a NY Times product? Or Yelp? That’s a quarter of a billion dollars worth of value that the paper with the most influential restaurant reviews page didn’t create. Why didn’t they build Wikipedia? Or a platform to influence the way politicians govern?
Hiring and promoting David Pogue is a great example of expanding that base into the online world. Buying about.com was smart, but being afraid to put the Times name on it was an error… an opportunity for leverage, wasted.
2. Leverage the op-ed page and spread important ideas:Sure, Tom Friedman and a handful of other columnists have a large reach and influence. But why doesn’t the Times have 50 columnists? 500?Tom PetersorJim LefforJoel SpolskyorMicah SifryorPam SlimorPatrick SemmensorDan Pinkwould be great columnists. Why not view the endless print space online as an opportunity to leverage their core asset?
What would happen if the huge team of existing Times editors and writers each interviewed an interesting or important person every day? 5,000 or 10,000 really important interviews every year, each waiting for a sponsor, each finding a relevant audience…
3. Build a permission asset:Times readers are among the most informed cultural consumers in the world. They tend to have money to spend and are eager for new ideas. What an opportunity to build 10 or a 100 or ten thousand silos. Carefully focused free email newsletters, and then blogs, each with an editor and plenty of relevant and useful ads. Well-written ideas, delivered with authority, are as important as ever. The Times sat back and let hundreds of other micro-sites deliver this instead.
4. Keep score:The New York Times bestseller list used to matter a great deal. It became a self-fulfilling prophecy, because bookstores discounted and promoted the bestsellers, which helped them sell more.
We still want to know what the bestsellers are, but the Times works hard not to tell us. There are literally a thousand categories of media that people want to know about (top blogs, top DVDs, etc.) and the Times abdicated their ability to keep score, to be the trusted referee and to drive the short head in almost every form of culture.
Consider this for a moment: Oprah is able to sell ten times as many copies of a book than the New York Times can. The Times abdicated their role as the leader of the conversation about books.
5. Stringers:
The Times has always used freelancers and stringers to report and contribute to the paper. But how many? Why doesn’t the paper have 10,000 stringers, each with a blog, each angling to be picked up by the central site? You wouldn’t have to pay much per story to build a semi-pro cadre of writers and reporters. When you organize the news (delivering unique perspectives to people who want to hear them) you influence the conversation.
6. Create new platforms for advertisers:
The Times has profited longer than most newspapers because of New York. New York is an efficient place to be a newspaper. Lots of people, lots of advertisers, lots of spending, influence all over the world. But even that isn’t enough to support the failing economics of dead trees and delivery. The only reason a paper exists (from a business point of view) is to sell ads.
So, what sort of ad-rich, ad-centric media could they build? From directories to pdfs to coupons to promotions, the list is nearly endless.
• • •
Instead of building something that dominates in this century the way they did in the last, the editors at the paper are pandering to the masses (and failing). Today’s Magazine not only features the aforementioned volumes of insight about Jennifer Aniston, but it also includes yet another lame Ethicist column (they run it because they always have) and a weak interview with David Lynch (which no one will talk about on Monday). It also features recipes (we don’t need more recipes, thanks, we now have an infinite number of recipes) and their latest affectation, which is overdesigned typesetting that is unreadable. All of these efforts are placeholders, not bold moves to create something that matters.
The people I know at the Times are smart, driven, honest and on a mission to do great work. The people didn’t fail the system, the system failed them.
Do the people running the Times know more about running a newspaper or building ideas that spread profitably online? How about the people running your organization? Odds are, they’re great at yesterday’s business.

What to do about Detroit,"I was in Detroit last week… I have family there. I also drive a car. And I would rather that the world doesn’t melt and the economy thrive. So I’m uniquely qualified to weigh in on the automobile industry.
Not only should Congress encourage/facilitate the organized bankruptcy of the Big Three, but it should also make it easy for them to be replaced by 500 new car companies.
Or perhaps a thousand.
That’s how many car companies there were 90 years ago.
That’s right, when all the innovation hit the car industry, there were thousands of car companies, with hundreds running at any one time. From Wikipedia:
Throughout this era, development of automotive technology was rapid,due in part to a huge number (hundreds) of small manufacturers allcompeting to gain the world’s attention. Key developments includedelectricignition(byRobert Bosch, 1903), independent suspension, and four-wheel brakes (by theArrol-JohnstonCompany of Scotland in 1909).[16]Leaf springswere widely used forsuspension, though many other systems were still in use, with angle steel taking over from armored wood as the frame material of choice.Transmissionsand throttle controls were widely adopted, allowing a variety ofcruising speeds, though vehicles generally still had discrete speedsettings rather than the infinitely variable system familiar in cars oflater eras.
Between 1907 and 1912, the high-wheel motor buggy (resembling thehorse buggy of before 1900) was in its heyday, with over seventy-fivemakers includingHolsman(Chicago),IHC(Chicago), andSears(which soldviacatalog); the high-wheeler would be killed by the Model T.
Back in its heyday, Ford Motor made every single part of its cars, including raising the sheep that grew the wool that made the fabric that upholstered the seats. That’s not true any more. Now, suppliers make just about every part. We need those suppliers, and we need them to stay healthy.
What we don’t need are giant companies with limited choice, confused priorities,private jetsand a bully’s attitude.
I’d spend a billion dollars to make the creation of a car company turnkey. Make it easy to get all the safety and regulatory approvals… as easy to start a car company as it is to start a web company. Use the bankruptcy to wipe out the hated, legacy marketing portion of the industry: the dealers.
We’d end up with a rational number of ""car stores"" in every city that sold lots of brands. We’d have super cheap cars and super efficient cars and super weird cars. There’d be an orgy of innovation, and from that, a whole new energy and approach would evolve. Betcha.","November 21, 2008","Detroit, automobile industry, innovation"
Google gets jiggy,"If you’re a signed in user of Google, you’ll notice the most significant change in search since their launch.
You can now interact with search results, wiki style.
You can vote them up or down and leave comments. And they will be seen by others.
1. This is going to lead to an incredible rush by small businesses and social networkers. They’re going to go crazy trying to game the system.
2. Google is going to find that millions of people pay a lot more attention to their search results (for now).
Interesting to consider what happens after that. How do they handle the deluge? Does democracy matter when it comes to search? How do you filter out the gamed votes?
Also interesting to think about how a tiny change in a beloved interface changes the way you think about and use it.
Google is a natural resource. We’re defensive. We don’t want them to wreck it, we want it to be here forever and we want it to work better for us. All at the same time. I give them ten points for bravery.",,"Google, search interaction, user engagement"
How to make money using the Internet,"Make money: not by building an internet company, but by using the net as a tool to create value and get paid. Use the internet as a tool, not as an end. Do it when you are part of a big organization or do it as a soloist. The dramatic leverage of the net more than overcomes the downs of the current economy.
The essence is this:connect.
Connect the disconnected to each other and you create value.
Some examples? I think it’s worth delineating these so you can see that the opportunity can be big, if that’s your taste, or small if you don’t want to invest heavily just yet.
Connect advertisers to people who want to be advertised to.Dani Levy did this with Daily Candy, a company she recently sold for more than a hundred million dollars. Daily Candy uses simple email software, there’s no technology tricks involved. Instead, it’s a simple permission marketing business… hundreds of thousands of therightpeople, getting an anticipated, personal and relevant email every day. (Note! This only works if you earn true permission, not that sort of fake half and half version that’s so common).
Connect job hunters with jobs.My friend Tara has made hundreds of thousands of dollars (in good years) working as an executive recruiter. But what did she actually do all day? She stayed connected with a cadre of people. She kept track of the all stars. She connected with the right people, invested time in them that her clients never thought  was worth it. So, when it was time to hire, it was easier for them to call Tara than it was for them to start from scratch. The best time to start a gig like this is right now, when no one in particular wants to connect with and help out the superstars. Later, when the economy bounces back, your position is extremely valuable. (Note! This only works if you have insane focus and the people you interact with are the true superstars, not just numbers).
Connect information seekers with information.At a large scale, this is what Bloomberg did to make his fortune. Spending $$$ on a Bloomberg terminal guarantees a user at least a fifteen minute head start on people who don’t have one. But consider how many micro markets where this connection doesn’t occur. Michael Cader offers it tobook publishersand does quite well. Which industry needs you to channel and collect and connect?
On a micro level, there are now people making thousands of dollars a month running their pages onSquidoo.That’s almost enough to be a full time job for a curious person with the generosity to share useful information.Connect teams to each other.How much is on the line when a company puts ten people in three offices on a quest to launch a major new product in record time? The question, then, is why wouldn’t they be willing to spend a little more to hire a team concierge? Someone to manage Basecamp and conference calls and scheduling and document source control to be sure the right people have the right information at the right time… I don’t think most organizations can hire someone to do this full time, but I bet this is a great specialty for someone who is good at it.
Connect those seeking similar.Who’s running the ad hoc association of green residential architects? Or connecting the hundred CFOs at the hundred largest banks in the US? It’s amazing how isolated most people are, even in a world crowded with people. I know of a guy who built an insanely profitable business around connecting C level executives at the Fortune 500. After all, there are only 500 of them. They want to know what the others are doing… (Considerthisexample)
Connect to partners and those that can leverage your work.
Freelances had no power because they depended on the client to hook them up with the rest of the team that could leverage their work. But what if you do that before you approach the client? What if you, the graphic designer, have a virtual partner who is an award winning copywriter and another partner who is a well-know illustrator? You could walk in the door and offer detailedPDFsor other high-impact viral electronic media in a turnkey package.
Connect people who are proximate geographically.We all know that newspapers are tanking. Yet news, it appears, is on the rise. This paradox is an opportunity. Who is connecting the 10,000 people in your little community/suburb/town/zip code to each other? One person who spends all day at school board meetings, breaking stories about a dumping scandal, profiling a local business person or teacher? If you did that, and built an audience of thousands by RSS and email… do you think you’d have any trouble selling out the monthly cocktail party/mixer? Any trouble finding sponsors among local businesses for a media property that actually and truly reaches everyone?
Connect organizations spending money with ways to save money.During the last recession, plenty of entrepreneurs scored by selling businesses on doing a phone bill audit. They took 30% of the first year’s savings and did the work for free. Today, there are countless ways businesses can save money using technology and outsourcing, but few take full advantage. You can train them to do this and keep a share of the savings.
Connect like-minded people into a movement.We’ve seen plenty of headstrong bootstrapped entrepreneurs turn a blog into the cornerstone of a multi-million dollar empire. The secret: they don’t write theirblogfor everyone. Instead, they use the blog as the center connecting point for a niche, and then go from there. It’s easy to list the tech successes, but there are literally 10,000 other niches just waiting for someone to connect them.
Connect people buying with people who are selling.Sure, you know how to use Craigslist and eBay to buy and sell… but most people don’t. How about finding people in your town with junk that needs removing, items that need selling, odd jobs that need filling… and then, for a fee, solve their problems using your laptop and these existing networks? Imagine the power, just to pick one example, of building an email alert list of 500 garage sale bargain hunters. Every time you email them, they show up. Now, you can walk into any home in any town and guarantee the biggest garage sale success they’ve ever seen… and you have the photos to prove it. As long as you protect the list and do for them, not to them, this asset increases in value.
The best time to do any of these projects was five years ago, so that today you’d be earning thousands of dollars a week. Too late. The second best time to start: now.","November 20, 2008","Make money, Connect, Internet opportunities"
The edifice complex,"Why do banks spend so much money on marble lobbies, high ceilings and yes, $400 million to name a baseball stadium?
Why do marketers buy TV ads that don’t increase sales in the short run?
Why have a receptionist and not just a house phone where you can call the person you came to see?
For the same reason that so many people have a green front lawn.
It’s organized waste. Profligate spending designed to communicate confidence and just a bit of hubris.
Do you really want to invest money at a bank run by a guy with nothing but a bridge table and a cheap suit? Probably not. At some level, we like the confidence that we get from that big lobby. We are more likely to perk up when the reporter has her cameraman aim a huge black video camera (with lights!) at us, even though the little hand held camera might work just as well…
In times of financial stress and bailouts, the obvious solution (eliminate all the waste!) is not the one that works. In fact, in these times, we’re more likely than ever to be nervous about the status of the organization we’re working with.
I’d replace the expensive sponsorships and buildings with something more valuable, quicker to market and far more efficient: people. Real people, trustworthy people, honest people… people who take their time, look you in the eye, answer the phone and keep their promises. Not as easy to implement as writing a big check for the Super Bowl, but a lot more effective.","November 19, 2008","organizational waste, confidence, marketing"

We feel your pain,"That’s the current motto of the folks over at Motrin. There’s been a ton of buzz the last two days about a botched ad campaign they ran, but this post isn’t really about that. It’s about being a human being and feeling pain.
After running an ad that offended some people, Motrin decided to take it down. This is what they put up on theirwebsite:

This isn’t a honest note from a real person. It’s the carefully crafted non-statement of a committee. What an opportunity to get personal and connected and build bridges…

Hungry,"I had lunch (a big lunch) with a college student last week. An hour later, she got up and announced she was going to get a snack. Apparently, she was hungry.
By any traditional definition of the word, she wasn’tactuallyhungry. She didn’t need more fuel to power her through an afternoon of sitting around. No, she was bored. Or yearning for a feeling of fullness. Or eager for the fun of making something or the break in the routine that comes from eating it. Most likely, she wanted the psychic satisfaction that she associates with eating well-marketed snacks.
Marketers taught us this. Marketers taught well-fed consumers to want to eat more than we needed, and consumers responded by spending more and getting fat in the process.
Marketers taught to us amplify our wants, since needs aren’t a particularly profitable niche for them. Isn’t it interesting that we don’t even have a word for these marketing-induced non-needs? No word for sold-hungry or sold-lonely…
Thirsty? Well, Coke doesn’t satisfy thirst nearly as well as water does. What Cokedoesdo is satisfy our need for connection or sugar or brand fun or consumption or Americana or remembering summer days by the creek…
People don’t need Twitter or an SUV or a purse from Coach. We don’t need much of anything, actually, but we want a lot. Truly successful industries align their ‘wants’ with basic needs (like hunger) and consumers (that’s us) cooperate all day long.
Think you could live without the $1800 a year you spend on cell phone service and $1200 a year you spend on cable TV? Of course you can. You did ten years ago. But now, that high-speed, always-on connection to the rest of the world is so associated with your basic need of connection that you can’t easily divorce the two.
As discretionary corporate and individual spending contracts, what’s going to get cut first? The obvious wants. The corporate dining room or the big screen TV for Christmas. What’s interesting to watch are the things that we can’t live without, the things we think we need, not want. Those things won’t get cut, yet most of them aren’t needs at all. That’s because the industries that market these items have done a brilliant job of persuading us that they are needs after all.
If you truly believe in what you sell, that’s where you need to be, creating wants that become needs. And if you’re a consumer (or a business that consumers) it might be time to look at what you’ve been sold as a need that’s actually a want.",,"Marketing, Needs, Wants"

Don’t sell to bar owners,"Rama wrote in and asked why I mentionedthis.What’s so hard about selling advertising to bar owners, and what can we learn from that?
My answer:
1. they’re not eager to buy new stuff (like ads)2. they don’t come to the phone3. they don’t come to the front of the bar because they’re not at the bar, they’re somewhere else4. they’re not really trying to grow the business
The universal lesson is this: every business has customers. In order to grow, you either need to sell more to those customers or find new customers. When thinking about your business, I’d ask:
The biggest problem marketers make is misjudging their audience. The see the size of the market, but not its true nature: Their accessibility and eagerness. Their worldview and motivation. All too often, we say, ""that’s Sales’ job."" And it’s true, a superstar salesperson might very well be able to sell to an audience that doesn’t want to be sold to.
Marketers are guilty of hoping for too much from a typical salesforce. In my experience, 90% of the salespeople out there are below average (because performance is a curve, not a line). The superstars are hard to find, hard to keep and hard to count on scaling. So that means you must create a product that doesn’t require a superstar to sell it. And the only way you’re going to sell an ad to a [insert difficult marketplace here] is to create a product/service/story that sells itself.","November 12, 2008","Selling, Bar Owners, Marketing"

The marketer’s attitude,"Traditional job requirements: show up, sober. Listen to the boss, lift heavy objects.
Here’s what I’d want if I were hiring a marketer:
You’re relentlessly positive. You can visualize complex projects and imagine alternative possible outcomes. It’s one thing to talk about thinking outside the box, it’s quite another to have a long history of doing it successfully. You can ride a unicycle, or can read ancient Greek.
Show me that you’ve taken on and completed audacious projects, and run them as the lead, not as a hanger on. I’m interested in whether you’ve become the best in the world at something, and completely unimpressed that you are good at following instructions (playing Little League baseball is worth far less than organizing a non-profit organization).
You have charisma in that you easily engage with strangers and actually enjoy selling ideas to others. You are comfortable with ambiguity, and rarely ask for detail or permission. Test, measure, repeat and go work just fine for you.
You like to tell stories and you’re good at it. You’re good at listening to stories, and using them to change your mind.
I’d prefer to hire someone who is largely self-motivated, who finds satisfaction in reaching self-imposed goals, and is willing to regularly raise the bar on those goals.
You’re intellectually restless. You care enough about new ideas to read plenty of blogs and books, and you’re curious enough about your own ideas that you blog or publish your thoughts for others to react to. You’re an engaging writer and speaker and you can demonstrate how the right visuals can change your story.
And you understand that the system is intertwined, that your actions have side effects and you not only care about them but work to make those side effects good ones.

Seen it all before,"What can you assume about your audience?
If you’re running a commercial, sending out a sales letter, making a presentation–what have they seen? What do they know?
A hundred years ago, when people went to see live music, the expectation was that they had never seen the work performed before, and they were unlikely to ever hear it again.
Forty years ago, it was assumed you were up to date on the current TV shows and the current commercials and the recent movies, but something from a decade earlier was too far in the past to refer to.
Now, if I give a presentation, I have to figure that some people in the audience have not only seen my five year old talk at TED, but they’ve seen EVERY talk that’s ever been giving at TED. Today, if you make an online video, you need to assume that some people have seen thousands or tens of thousands of online videos before you got there. Every TV show ever made is floating around somewhere. Cultural references don’t go away, they just get added to the stack.
Nokia now assumes that you’ve seen the iPhone. New photo sharing sites assume you’ve seen Flickr.Stephenie Meyerassumes you’ve read Harry Potter.
While it’s likely that some people in your audience have seen almost everything, it’s also quite likely that there’s nothing (nothing!) that everyone in your audience has seen. There are going to be people who don’t get this reference or that reference. There are certainly going to be people who, given the needle in a haystack culture we live in now, just haven’t seen the particular idea you’re riffing on.
Your audience isn’t as homogeneous as it used to be. That means you have a few choices:
1. Inquire. For a small group, or for important interactions, ask. Ask if they’ve been to your site or read your recent blog posts. Ask if they use this software or that software. Ask if they’ve seen Buckaroo Bonzai or not. Ask if this is the first time in your restaurant (or better yet, let your database tell you).
2. Assume. If you don’t ask, you’re going to have to guess. You can make it clear you’re assuming, which puts the burden on the unclued to keep up, or you can take a huge risk and just assume. This strategy works best for large groups, where hitting a home run with half the audience is probably worth the journey.
3. Punt. Don’t ask, don’t make thoughtful assumptions, just pretend we’re living in a three-channel, all-on-the-same-page universe. I think this is the default setting for most marketers, and quite a mistake.","November 10, 2008","audience diversity, cultural references, communication strategy"
Off the record,"One of the best lines of Animal House, sanitized here for your enjoyment: ""You screwed up. You trusted me.""
In a world where everyone owns a media channel, I guess that makes us all journalists. Journalists have more power than ordinary folks, because they can spread a message farther and faster. The question is, what sort of long-term choices are you going to make in your career as an amateur journalist?
Seymour Hersh has won a Pulitzer Prize for his hard-hitting coverage of the Pentagon, and one reason he’s able to break big stories is because his sources know that they won’t get busted for talking to him. The reason? He doesn’t reveal them. There’s no doubt that he could make a huge splash by writing, ""Colin Powell told me…"" but of course, if he did that, burned a source that spoke to him off the record, he’d never be trusted again.
I end all my emails with a sig that says, ""This note is off the record (blogs, too) unless we agree otherwise."" I don’t do this because I have something to hide, I do it because it makes it easier to have a human-to-human conversation. If I believe I’m talking on the record, to everyone, I need to be a lot more careful in what I type. Of course, there’s no way for me to enforce this. No way for me to sue you or something if you start taking my words (in context or not) and post them here and there. Except for one: I just won’t trust you again. And in fact, neither will your other readers. [Blogs, profiles, and tweets of course, are out there for anyone who wants to borrow or share them.]
Go to a party and take embarrassing pictures of your friends to post on Facebook. That’s fun, certainly, but it’s possible that you won’t be quite as trusted next time.
Take that email your boss sent to the six people in your group and post it anonymously to some web gossip site… wanna bet your boss is a lot more careful about telling you and your peers the truth next time?
The good news is that we all need to act as if we’re on camera… behavior ought to improve. The bad news is that it’s harder to trust people we might have expected to be more discreet or engaged.
There’s a giddy history of amateurs using the web to build up scandal sheets and generate traffic by violating the trust of their friends and colleagues. What’s clear is that this isn’t a long term strategy for success. When in doubt, ask first. Maybe your source doesn’t mind. Maybe you misunderstood the intent of the original message.

Tribal effects don’t disappear (even in politics),"This map from theNew York Timesis eye opening.
It shows the counties that recorded an increase in Republican voting. That is, counties with more Republican votes than in the close re-election campaign George W. Bush ran.
Judging from the geography of these redder counties, it wasn’t because of the economics (most of these voters would have no tax benefits under McCain) and it wasn’t because of social issues (the last election was as profoundly divided on this axis as this one). My only explanation is that tribal identity was enough to get non-voters out to vote.

The sad lie of mediocrity,"Doing 4% less does not get you 4% less.
Doing 4% less may very well get you 95% less.
That’s because almost good enough gets you nowhere. No sales, no votes, no customers. The sad lie of mediocrity is the mistaken belief that partial effort yields partial results. In fact, the results are usually totally out of proportion to the incremental effort.
Big organizations have the most trouble with this, because they don’t notice the correlation. It’s hidden by their momentum and layers of bureaucracy. So a mediocre phone rep or a mediocre chef may not appear to be doing as much damage as they actually are.
The flip side of this is that when you are at the top, the best in the world, the industry leader, a tiny increase in effort and quality can translate into huge gains. For a while, anyway.","November 7, 2008","mediocrity, effort, results"
The 90/10 rule of marketing a job,"Most hiring managers don’t understand organizations that go to extraordinary lengths to find and retain amazing people. And from their point of view, they’re completely correct. Pay market wage, run a classified, process the resumes. Done.
It only takes 10% as much effort to hire someone in the bottom 90% of the class.
And it takes the other 90% to find and cajole and retain the top 10%.
Most hiring, especially in a down market, is handled as a mostly bureaucratic task. Find people who fit in, do a rudimentary background check to eliminate problems, try not to break any hiring laws…
If your organization can thrive with ordinary folks, then the marketing you’re doing right now to fill the ranks might even be overkill. You’ve got plenty of resumes. No need to pretend you’re doing anything much more than bottom fishing, though. That plaque for employee of the month? You can sell it on eBay.
On the other hand, organizations that work best with extraordinary talent are almost certainly not investing enough in finding and developing it. If marketing works so well that you spend a fortune on it, why aren’t you marketing your jobs?

Marketing lessons from the US election,"The polls open in a few minutes, and unlike pundits that wait until after the polls have closed, I thought I’d do the opposite. It’s obvious that this is the most talked about election in the history of the world, and I think there are some lessons for every marketer, regardless of nationality or political leanings.
It turns out that one way you learn about marketing is by analyzing it. (The other way is to do it). Yet people hate analyzing three really useful but emotional examples of marketing that matters: politics, organized religion and their own organizations. I figure we can start here, with the easiest of the three.
This is a long post. Fine with me if you skip it and just go vote instead.
Here goes:Stories really matter.More than a billion dollars spent, two ‘products’ that have very different features, and yet, when people look back at the election they will remember mavericky winking. You can say that’s trivial. I’ll say that it’s human nature. Your product doesn’t have features that are more important than the ‘features’ being discussed in this election, yet, like most marketers, you’re obsessed with them. Forget it. Thestoryis what people respond to.
Mainstream media isn’t powerful because we have no other choices (see below). It’s powerful because they’re still really good at writing and spreading stories, stories we listen to and stories we believe.
TV is over.If people are interested, they’ll watch. On their time (or their boss’s time). They’ll watch online, and spread the idea. You can’t email a TV commercial to a friend, but you can definitely spread a YouTube video. The cycle of ads got shorter and shorter, and the most important ads were made for the web, not for TV. Your challenge isn’t to scrape up enough money to buy TV time. Your challenge is to make video interesting enough that we’ll choose to watch it and choose to share it.
Permission matters(though selfish marketers still burn it). The Republican party has a long tradition of smart direct mail tactics. Over the years, they’ve used them to aggressively outfundraise and outcampaign the Democrats. In this election cycle, smart marketers at the Obama campaign toned down the spam and turned up thepermission.They worked relentlessly to build a list, and they took care of the list. They used metrics to track open rates and (at least until the end) appeared to avoid burning out the list with constant fundraising. Anticipated, personal and relevant messages will always outperform spam. Regardless of how it is delivered.
Marketing is tribal.This one, for obvious reasons, fascinated me this cycle.
Karl Rove and others before him were known for cultivating the‘base’.This was shorthand for a tribe of people with shared interests and vision (it included a number of conservatives and evangelicals). George W. Bush was able to get elected twice by embracing the base, by connecting them, by being one of them.
John McCain had a dilemma. He didn’t particularly like the base nor did they like him. His initial strategy was not to lead this existing tribe, but to weave a newtribe. The idea was that independents and some Democrats, together with the traditional pre-Reagan core of the Republican party, would weave together a new centrist base.
Barack Obama also had a challenge. He knew that the traditional base for Democratic candidates wouldn’t be sufficient to get him elected (it had failed John Kerry). So he too set out to weave a new tribe, a tribe that included progressives, the center, younger religious voters, weary veterans, internationalists, Nobel prize winners, black voters and others.
Building a new tribe (in marketing and in politics) is time consuming and risky and expensive. Both set out to do this.
Then, McCain made a momentous decision. He chose Sarah Palin, and did it for one huge reason: to embrace the Rove/Bush ‘base’. To lead a tribe that was already there, but not yet his. He was hoping for a side effect, which was to attract Hillary Clinton’s tribe, one that in that moment, was also leaderless.
Seen through the lens of tribes and marketing, this is a fascinating and risky event.Are people willing to suspend disbelief or suspicion and embrace a leader in order to maintain the energy of their tribe?
If it had worked, it would have been a master stroke. He would have solidified his base, grabbed key constituencies of Clinton supporters in swing states and wooed the center as well. Three tribes in one pick.
In McCain’s case, it failed. His choice cost him the economically-concerned middle (which went to Obama’s carefully woven tribe). And it clearly cost him the mostly female Clinton tribe. Yes, he energized the conservative base, but he lost the election. If he had chosen Mike Huckabee, one could wonder what would have happened. Would this less polarizing figure been able to collect a bigger tribe for him?
This is a real question for every marketer with an idea to sell. Do you find an existing tribe (Harley drivers, Manolo shoe buyers, frequent high-end restaurant diners) and try to co-opt them? Or do you try the more expensive and risky effort of building a brand new tribe? The good news is that if you succeed, you get a lot for your efforts. The bad news is that you’re likely to fail.
Motivating the committed outperforms persuading the uncommitted.The unheralded success factor of Obama’s campaign is the get out the vote effort. Every marketer can learn from this. It’s easier (far easier) to motivate the slightly motivated than it is to argue with those that either ignore you or are predisposed to not like you.
Attack ads don’t always work.There’s a reason most product marketers don’t use attack ads. All they do is suppress sales of your opponent, they don’t help you. Since TV ads began, voter turnout has progressively decreased. That’s because the goal of attack ads is to keep your opponent’s voters from showing up. Both sides work to whittle down the other. In a winner-take-all game like a political election, this strategy is fine if it works.
So why didn’t the ads work this time?
The tribe that Obama built identified with him.Attacking him was like attacking them.They took it personally, and their outrage led to more donations and bigger turnout. This is the lucky situation Apple finds itself in as well. Attacking an Apple product is like attacking an Apple user.
We get what we deserve.The lesson that society should take away about all marketing is a simple one. When you buy a product, you’re also buying the marketing. Buy something from a phone telemarketer, you get more phone telemarketers, guaranteed. Buy a gas guzzler and they’ll build more. Marketers are simple people… they make what sells. Our culture has purchased (and voted) itself into the place we are today.

"Reacting, Responding & Initiating","Most knowledge workers spend their day doing one of three things:
Zigtaught me the difference between the first two. When you react to a medication, that’s a bad thing. When you respond to treatment, that’s a plus.
So, think about your team or your front line staff or your CEO. Something happens in the outside world. An angry comment on Twitter or a disappointed passenger on your airline or a change in the stock price…
Do you react to it? How much of your time is spent reacting to what people say in meetings or emails?
The rest of your day may be spent responding. Responding to a request for proposal. Responding to a form in your inbox. Responding to emails or responding to status updates on Facebook. Responding is gratifying, because you go from having something to do —> to having something done. There’s a pile in a different spot on your desk at the end of the day. You responded to the needs of the tribe you lead, or you responded to password-change requests or you responded to the boss’s punch list.
And that’s it. You go home having done virtually nothing in the third bucket.
We tend to reserve the third bucket, initiate, for quiet times, good times, down times or desperate times. We wait until the inbox is empty or the new product lines are due (at which point the initiative is more of a response). It’s possible to spend an entire day blogging and twittering and facebooking and never initiate a thing, just respond to what’s coming in. It’s possible to spend an entire day at P&G (actually it’s possible to spend an entire career) doing nothing but responding…
Take a look at your Sent folder. Is it filled with subject lines that start with RE: ? Consider your job at the University–do you actively recruit people who don’t even apply for professorships? What about your blog–does it start conversations or just continue them?
What did your brand or organization initiate today?

"The economy, the press and the paradox","Wealth is not created by financial manipulation, the trading of equities or the financing of banks. They just enable it.
Wealth is created by productivity. Productive communities generate more of value.
Productivity comes from innovation.
Innovation comes from investment and change.
The medialemmings,the same ones that encouraged you to get a second mortgage, buy a McMansion and spend, spend, spend are now falling all over themselves to out-mourn the others. They are telling everyone to batten down, to cut back, to freeze and panic. They’re looking for stories about this, advice about this, hooks about this.
And of course, the paradox. If, in the middle of some sensible budgeting and waste trimming, we stop investing in the future, stop innovating, stop finding the breakthrough that leads to the next round of productivity gain, then in fact they’re right, it does last forever.
I believe that we’re on the verge of some exponential increases in productivity. Productivity in marketing as the waste of reaching the masses goes away. Productivity in energy as we figure out how to make a renewable process that gives us incremental units of power for free (think about the impact of that for a moment) and productivity in group work and management as we allow the network to do more than let us watch stupid YouTube videos at work. The three biggest expenses of most endeavors (the energy to make it, the people who create it and the marketing that spreads the idea) are about to be overhauled.

It’s true, ""write what you know, write what you love."" The commitment comes through. But does that mean that boring products shouldn’t be marketed? Does it mean that the community theater must limit the list it considers for any job only to people who are ‘in’ the theater, who have paid their dues?
How many worthy causes have lousy operations teams? How many hobbies and sports are staffed by fans, not professionals?
I think if the work is important, it should be done with passion and skill and flair. But the work of balancing the books, or running Google adwords or making sure that customers are treated well at the ski school often has nothing to do with the product or service itself.
It’s more important that you be passionate about what you do all day than it is to be passionate about the product that is being sold.
Give me someone with domain expertise and the passion to do great work any time. Belief in the mission matters (a lot!), but it doesn’t replace skill.
Best of both worlds: someone who has passion (and skill and insight) about their task and passion about the mission. The latter can never replace the former. Organizations staffed with sports fans or true believers worry me, because they often use their passion as an excuse for poor performance. What worries me more are the employees who have neither expertise nor passion.

"10,000 hours","It’s not surprising that Malcolm Gladwell’s newbookhas made a splash. All his thought-provoking writing does and deserves to.
The argument ofOutliers:
Bill Gates, the Beatles, Beethoven, Bill Joy, Tiger Woods–do the math, 10,000 hours of work.
In some ways, this is a restatement ofthe Dip. Being the best in the world brings extraordinary benefits, but it’s not easy to get there.
For me, though, some of the 10k analysis doesn’t hold up. The Doors (or Devo or the Bee Gees) for example, didn’t play together for 10,000 hours before they invented a new kind of rock*. If the Doors had encountered significantly more competition for their brand of music, it’s not clear that they could have gotten away with succeeding as quickly as they did. Hey, Miley Cyrus wasn’t even 10,000 hours awake before she became a hit.
Doc Searls and Scoble didn’t blog for 10,000 hours before they became the best, most important bloggers in the world. Molly Katzen didn’t work on her recipes for 10,000 hours before she wrote the Moosewood Cookbook either.
*(There were bar bands in Buffalo, where I grew up, that put in farmore than 10,000 playing mediocre music… didn’t help. Hard work maybe necessary, but not sufficient).
Here’s my take on it:You win when you become the best in the world, however ‘best’ and ‘world’ are defined by your market. In many mature markets, it takes 10,000 hours of preparation to win becausemost people give up after 5,000 hours. That’s the only magic thing about 10k… it’s a hard number to reach, so most people bail.
Yo Yo Ma isn’t perfect… he’s just better than everyone else. He pushed through the Dip that others chose not to. I’m guessing that there are endeavors (like being CEO of a Fortune 500 company or partner at a big law firm) where the rewards are so huge that the number is closer to 20,000 hours or more to get through the Dip.
But, ready for this? The Dip is much closer in niche areas, new areas, unexplored areas. You can get through the Dip in an online network or with a new kind of music because being seen as the best in that area is easier (at least for now). You can get through the Dip as a real estate broker in a new, growing town a lot quicker than someone in midtown Manhattan. The competition is thinner and probably less motivated.
Yes, it matters where and when you were born. It matters that you get lucky. And it matters most of all that you saw the Dip, realized how far away it was and chose to push through it.","December 29, 2008","10,000 hours, Outliers, competition"
Service worth paying for,"Let’s say you’re stuck in the airport and you need to figure out if you can transfer your seat from your airline to another. Would you pay $20 to talk to a competent, empowered agent who answered on the first ring?
That’s four calls an hour, $80 an hour for an agent that costs the airline a fraction of that. A new profit center, one that causes joy, not hassles.
Of course, no one would use the service if it wasn’t worth paying for.
So, that’s the interesting challenge. If youhadto charge for service, what would the service be like?

In search of competition,"If your pipes break at 3 am, Roto Rooter is happy.
They’re organized for emergencies like this, for moments when you have no choice but to do business with them. Since you’re out of options, their high-priced service is your best shot.
They do far less well in the light of day, when you can take your time and compare plumbers and perhaps bargain a little.
Some businesses prefer to catch you when you have no choice. They use market conditions or even patents to ensure that they can be the bully. I’m not sure that there’s anything wrong with this, but I’m certain that it is a deliberate choice.
Other businesses, like Amazon, do better when they have lots of competition. Amazon has made it easy for other vendors to use their technology platform and even to sell items on their site. Why? Because they understand that more competition brings more attention, more business, more commerce. And since they are organized for volume and are eager to compete, more competition helps them.
The only way to enjoy competition is to have something different, or better, or something that scales. You need to offer a community that increases in value as it scales, or a unique perspective or technology.
Compare Amazon to the folks that make the Invisible Fence® dog containment system. They hate competition. In my experience, they have really high prices, nasty policies and a take-it-or-leave-it attitude. That’s okay, as long as you really don’t have a choice–you need a system like this, and they have it. If there were a transparent market for this product, they’d fail in a heartbeat.
Of course, nothing lasts forever, and competition does show up. Then what?
If you run your restaurant knowing that there are dozens of other restaurants on your block, things will be easier when in fact there are other restaurants down the block.
Which situation benefits your church or your political candidate or your store? Do you do better when you’re the only choice, with all the power that this brings, or when there are many choices, with all the audience and excitement that this brings?
You can pretend that you are unique, that you have no competition and never will. Inevitably, this will create an attitude that, while fun for a while, will probably harm you later. The alternative is to acknowledge that the competition exists and in fact, to encourage it. I have never met an author who believes that her book is the only one in the world you can buy… and this realization changes the way books are written and marketed.

One Santa to rule them all,"
All Santas look the same. This is important to you if you’re a marketer.
Lots of brands and markets splinter. We have markets with hundreds of different cell phone models, catalogs containing tens of thousands of different kinds of nuts and bolts. There are very few marketing examples of a natural monopoly.
The Bell phone system was a natural monopoly. Consumers benefitted from having one and only one phone system, so anyone could call anyone. The bigger it got, the better it worked.
Microsoft, for a long time, profitted from a natural monopoly on their operating system. Having the same system on every computer benefitted them as much as it benefitted the users. Google, of course, is now profiting from an ever more efficient and widespread operating system (the web).
But those are businesses, not marketing icons or brands. Santa, on the other hand, is the living logo of a holiday and an idea. And we don’t want multiple versions. There are no real pretenders to the Nast/Coke Santa that show any sign of catching on, because the market benefits when there’s just one icon to represent this idea–a key part of the appeal, even for rational skeptics, is that there’s precisely one Santa and this is what he looks like.
Which is the lesson for marketers: If you set out to build an iconic brand/logo, your best opportunity is to find a story, a market and a process that works best when there’s only one. They’re easy to recognize when someone points them out to you: Harley, the Nobel Prize, the Super Bowl. Walter Cronkite, Oprah, Warren Buffet. Tiffany, Sand HIll Road, Heinz ketchup. These are brands we rely on not when we want to have an argument (Ford vs. Chevy) but when we want to know we got the right one, the only one, the best one.

Hubris vs. Humility,"It’s pretty easy for a successful marketer to be persuaded that his performance is directly related to his skill.
Same thing with investment managers. In the fiscal year just ended,Harvardpaid its top five investment managers an average of more than $4 million. Each. Per year.
Of course, if you believe in the ""you must be present to win"" theory of management, in which being part of the right organization in the right moment of time is more important than who you are, this is totally outrageous. Surely there were managers just as good who could be hired for a paltry million dollars a year. Surely the high-paid Harvard team was taking no real personal risk. Surely they don’t work much harder to earn 20% for the University than on the days when they might earn just 15%. No real connection between effort and results.
On the other hand, if you belong to the ""great minds"" school, then this team wasunderpaid,and if Harvard had just paid a little more, they would have ended up without such a loss on their hands. I think it’s clear from current events that there was no correlation between talent and pay on Wall Street.
Back in 1999, every internet marketer was a genius. And well paid, too. A lot of those marketing geniuses brought hubris to their work. They acted big, spent big and never looked at or learned from their mistakes.
Others, just a few, approached their work with a sense of gratitude. They realized that the good times wouldn’t last forever and they tried to develop skills and insights and connections for the future.
It’s interesting–years later, very few of the arrogant guys have done much of anything. They never developed perspectives or attitudes that extended beyond, ""hey, shut up, I’m here, we’re winning,"" and so they failed once they left the mother ship.
This is why you should hesitate to hire a marketer or salesperson who comes from a successful big company marketer (like Apple or Microsoft). Sure, they ‘contributed’ to the growth of a great brand, but how much? What did they learn? What will they do when they don’t have a one in a million brand and the wind at their back? Or in the case of P&G alum, what will they do when they don’t have billions of dollars to spend on advertising?
Confidence is often a self-fulfilling prophecy, particularly in marketing or investing. Arrogance, on the other hand, is hard to reward. My favorite combination is the quiet confidence of knowledge, combined with the humility that comes from realizing that you’re pretty lucky and that you have no idea at all what’s guaranteed to work tomorrow.","December 23, 2008","Hubris, Humility, Marketing"
What is viral marketing?,"Viral marketing is an idea that spreads–andan idea that while it is spreading actually helps market your business or cause.
Two kinds of viral marketing: The original classic sort in which the marketingisthe product and which a self-amplifying cycle occurs. Hotmail, for example, or YouTube. The more people use them, the more people see them. The more people see them, the more people use them. The product or service must be something that improves once more people use it.
A second kind has evolved over the last few years, and that’s a marketing campaign that spreads but isn’t the product itself.Shepard Fairey‘s poster of Barack Obama was everywhere, because people chose to spread it. It was viral (it spread) and it was marketing (because it made an argument–a visual one–for a candidate.)
Something being viral is not, in an of itself, viral marketing. Who cares that 32,000,000 people saw your stupid video? It didn’t market you or your business in a tangible, useful way.
Marketers are obsessed with free media, and, as is often the case, we blow it in our rush to get our share. We create content that is hampered or selfish or boring. Or we create something completely viral that doesn’t do any marketing at all.
I wrote the first mainstream book about viral marketing. It’s free (still) eight years (and millions of downloads) later.
Download 2000Ideavirus.pdf
I haven’t updated it or made it pretty, but I think the core ideas stand up pretty well. (I even talk about the Zipf’s Law and the long tail, but didn’t realize it at the time).
Here’s how the book itself is an example of viral marketing:
1. I posted the PDF for free. Three thousand people downloaded it on day one.
2. The file is small enough to email to your friends. I encouraged people to do just that.
3. Some people mailed it to fifty or a hundred people. It spread.
4. That’s just viral. The marketing part? I released a $40 souvenir hardcover edition. People knew the idea but didn’t like the format or my design skills. So they paid a lot for a book they had already read. It went to #5 on Amazon (#4 in Japan). We sold the rights in dozens of languages. And thepaperbackrights. And it helped me get speaking gigs.
BUT! 5. That’s not why I did it. If I had done it as a clever way to sell books, it would have failed. It would have failed because I would have somehow tried to track it, or added friction, or tried to profit in some way from the idea. I was way too dumb at the time to have done it right if my goal was to do it ‘right’.
The critical element of viral marketing is this: it’s built in. It was built into Hotmail and built into YouTube. The more people used the camera on their cell phones, the more the idea spread, the more people wanted a camera.
If you want to do viral marketing, you can try to come up with a viral ad, but you’ll probably fail. You’re better off building the viral right into the product, creating a product that spreads because you designed it that way.
Viral marketing only works well when you plan for it, when you build it in, when you organize your offering to be spreadable, interesting and to work better for everyone involved when it spreads. If I don’t benefit from spreading it, why should I spread it? I won’t. If you don’t benefit from your users spreading the idea, it might spread, but it won’t help you much. So both elements have to be present.
The reason for this post is that viral marketing is getting a bad name, largely from clueless marketing agencies and clueless marketers. Here’s what they do: they get a lame product, or a semi-lame product, and they don’t have enough time or money to run a nationwide ad campaign. So, instead, they slap some goofy viral thing on top of it and wait for it to spread. And if it doesn’t spread, they create a faux controversy or engage a PR firm or some bloggers and then it still doesn’t work.
Being viral isn’t the hard part. The hard part is making that viral element actually produce something of value, not just entertainment for the client or your boss.","December 22, 2008","Viral Marketing, Product Design, Marketing Strategy"

Years ago, I went to the AOL partner’s conference. I’m no runner (unless someone is chasing me) yet I signed up for the early morning run because I knew Steve Case, CEO of AOL, would be running. I ran with him for twenty minutes, almost killed myself. Didn’t help. (But I’m glad I met him).
If you’re an author, can Jeff Bezos at Amazon help you more than a motivated promotions manager far down the ladder? It’s unlikely.
People in charge can rarely help you, because they are rarely (truly) in charge.

Two ways to deal with “no”,"You could contact the organization that turned you down and explain that they had made a terrible mistake, the wrong choice and a grave error. You could criticize the vendor they actually selected, bring You could even question the judgment of the prospect and try to teach them to make better decisions in the future. And, while you’re at it, challenge the fairness of the decision-making committee itself, and explain how a more fair process would have favored you at the same time it would have helped the organization that turned you down.
Or
You could be more gracious than if you’d won the work. You could send a thank you note for the time invested, you could sing the praises of the vendor chosen in your stead and you could congratulate the buyer, ""based on the criteria you set out, it’s clear that you made exactly the right choice for your organization right now."" That doesn’t mean the criteria were right, it just means that you’re not attacking the person for being an impulsive lunatic. You could even outline what you learned from the process and what you’ll be changing in the future. And you can make it clear that you’re in it for more than just a sale, and you’ll be around if they ever need you.
Couple questions:
1. Which one will make you more likely to be invited back, or to be the backup if the first choice fails?
and

In the old days, money added friction. Money made you choosy. Money ensured that you valued your marketing efforts appropriately, because if they didn’t work, they cost you money.
Today, reading and posting and linking and networking and connecting and commenting and podcasting and linkblurbling and doseedoing online all feel like essential marketing tasks. They certainly keep you busy.

For individuals, the internet represents anincreasein leverage. One person with a blog or a lot of followers or friends can reach more people, more quickly, than ever before.

The smartest and most motivated young people are no longer itching to become investment bankers and lawyers. We’re always hearing about ashortage of engineersor nurses–but there never seems to be a shortage of people eager to work 90 hours a week helping to move money from one pile to another.
Applicationsto work on the Obama team are over 300,000 (up from about 44,000 at this point in the Bush administration). Students are deciding to become fellows at Acumen or to set up innovative small businesses or volunteer their time or bootstrap a music career. Perhaps we’re on the verge at getting much better at making useful things, spreading ideas that matter and helping people, and not quite so good at leveraging capital for financial institutions. Imagine what would happen if 5,000 investment bankers or 500 M & A lawyers put their talents to work doing something else…
As I look through all the notes andapplicationsI received for the program I’m running next year, I’m not just optimistic.I’m thrilled.There must be hundreds of thousands of movers and shakers out there, people of all ages who are smart and get things done. And more and more, they’re being motivated by the quest, or the outcome, or the people they work with, not just the cash payout. It’s exciting beyond words. The ten people I’ve chosen are just astonishing, each and every one of them.
If you can’t find people like these, you’re not looking in the right places. And if you can’t figure out how to work with them, you’re missing out.",,"young talent, social impact, career motivation"

"Brands, social, clutter and the sundae","The Timesreportsthat traditional brand advertising on Facebook is a total failure. If you’ve been doing this for a while, this is no real surprise.
Mark Drapeauasks whether brands belong on Twitter [I apologize to Mark for initially misunderstanding his post. My fault.].Venture Beatsays that Twitter made Dell a million dollars. That’s nuts. Did the phone company make Dell a billion dollars? Just because people used the phone to order their Dell doesn’t mean that the phone was a marketing medium. It was a connecting medium. Big difference.
There are two key problems here.
First, these big companies are asking precisely the wrong question. They are asking, ""how can we use these new tools to leverage our existing businesses?"" They want to use the thing they have (money) to get the thing they need (attention) and are basically trying to force ads onto a medium that just doesn’t want them. Do people really want to follow P&G on Twitter so they can learn about the history of the soap operas they sponsored? Why? There are millions of people to friend or follow or interact with… why oh why are you going to spend time with Dunkin Donuts unless there is something in it for you?
Traditional advertising is inherently selfish. It interrupts in order to generate money (part of which pays for more interruptions). That approach doesn’t work at a cocktail party, or at a funeral or in a social network.
This is themeatballsundae. Asking what the medium can do for you instead of what you can do for the medium.
The second problem is a lot more subtle. It’s the clutter of the impersonal. Yes, you want an alert from a friend when it’s really a friend and really an alert. But what happens when it’s an ad that pretends to be an alert? Or what if it’s not an ad, but not really a totally personal tweet either?
It’s too late for the social sites to go back to descriptions of what you had for lunch. There will be a line drawn, and right now it seems to be at the point where marketers discover that they are wasting their money.
The clutter is going to get a lot worse. Marketers and free media are drawn to each other, even if the results aren’t always very good. Until marketers get off the greed train, though, it’s going to be a long time between pots of gold.",,"Brand advertising, social media, clutter"
The power of smart copywriting,"Consider this riff from a professionaly printed freestanding sign in front of a Peet’s in San Jose:
""Unlike Any Coffee You’ve Ever Tasted Before.""
Wait. Why the capitals?
""Unlike any coffee you’ve ever tasted before.""
""Before"" is redundant.
""Unlike any coffee you’ve ever tasted.""
Too negative. And why is ""unlike"" a positive trait? I mean, boiled leech guts is also unlike any coffee I’ve ever tasted, that doesn’t mean I want to drink it. How about:
""The best coffee you’ve ever tasted.""
Well, the thing is, the only coffee that matters is coffee I’ve tasted, right, so we could get shorter still:
""The best coffee.""
The problem with that is that it’s nothing but bragging. Of course you think it’s the best coffee. So what? You’re lying. And even if you’re not lying, how do you know it’s the best? Compared to what?
This is where the smart copywriter becomes a marketer.
""Better than Starbucks.""
Well, it’s still bragging. This is the moment where the marketer becomes a smart marketer and realizes that changing the offer or the product is more important than changing the hype.

Selling ideas to a big company,"I have been selling ideas for a long time, and decided to become a book packager (which I did before doing what I do now) solely because it’s an industry that makes it possible to sell ideas.
One project took more than five years (selling Stanley Kaplan on creating a line oftest prep books, finding a publisher and then creating them and launching the series) and one book took a day to invent, a day to sell and three days to write. I learned a lot of lessons the hard way–I got 900 rejection letters my first year and sold exactly one project.
Two things have to happen before a big company buys your idea:
1. They have to be in the business of buying ideas.
The book business buys ideas. The toy industry does, but only through a tiny number of agents. The car industry… hardly ever. Apple doesn’t buy ideas, but they don’t mind stealing them.
A company that likes buying ideas has a process. They make it relatively straightforward and they have no upside in stealing from you. A company that isn’t in that business puts up barriers. They troll around trade shows looking for ideas to take (and there’s nothing legally or morally wrong with that, imho).
Years ago, I invented the first fax board for the Mac. Our plan was to build a prototype and then sell the rights to one of the many Mac peripheral companies. The experience was eye opening. We talked with more than a dozen companies and had meetings with more than six. Some companies were clearly professionals at this, others were just fumbling in the dark.
I also invented a version of the wireless music player (sort of a precessor of theSonos). We spent a lot of money and built a prototype and brought it to various hi-fi companies to license. One of the first stops was Polk Audio, a leading speaker company with direct mail experience looking for growth. It seemed a perfect fit.
We had a nice meeting, but I was sure we were out of luck before it started. To get to their offices, we had to walk through the factory. Polk is basically a furniture company that makes speakers. The entire culture was focused on cutting wood and shaping it into speakers. They had no experience or desire to make an electronic device off shore and market it.
Short summary: if you have an idea for a company that doesn’t know how to buy it, move on. And if you want to be in the business of selling ideas, find an industry that has experience buying those ideas.
2. They have to trust you
This is far bigger than it sounds. Venture capitalists, for example, appear to be in the business of buying ideas. They’re not. Far from it. They are in the business of funding entrepreneurs. The ideas are secondary, easy to find, not so important. The entrepreneurs, the ones you can trust to stick it out, to push through the Dip, to tell you the truth, to hire and lead and inspire… that is the scarce resource.
The reason that big companies don’t want to hear from you is that they don’t trust you. They don’t trust you to understand their industry, or to understand implementation. They don’t trust your judgment about whether it’s a good idea. They don’t trust you won’t flake out, or sue them, or sell your ideas to multiple parties.
You may be tempted to seek out a middleman, someone they do trust, an idea scout. While I’m sure there are a few reputable people out there, in most industries, they’re just scam artists looking to take your money. Again, in the book business it’s different, there are reputable agents, they never charge their authors and they all charge about the same commission. But in my experience, there are very few analogues to this in other industries.
So… if you want to be in the business of selling ideas to industry (as opposed to getting that once-in-a-lifetime idea off your chest and cashing out), the thing to do is find an industry, one where you are likely to be trusted, one where you have a sense that they understand how to buy ideas. Invest in that industry, spend time, speak at trade shows, earn your right to credibility. Then, over time, day by day, you’ll have the ability to bring them profitable ideas.
Side note: the more complicated your idea is, the better off you are patenting it. Dean Kamen made his fortune patenting wheelchairs and other devices that you and I could never hope to build. On the other hand, if your idea is simple enough to dream up in a week, the only way you’re going to protect it is to build it, fast and well.","December 15, 2008","selling ideas, industry trust, idea packaging"
Set the agenda by showing up first,"If you want to win an Academy Award, it’s clear that you need to release your movie at the end of the year. Early movies don’t get remembered, don’t get nominated, don’t win.
But for most marketers (and job seekers) most of the time, being first is an advantage.
First competent mover advantage is real. The first person with agreatproduct or story that matches the market establishes the narrative, sets the bar and forces followers to conform to her specs. If you’ve got the good stuff, going first means you’ve set a standard… the consumer now has to abandon you to choose someone else, which means pain and admitting an error. People hate to do that. (Evidence:Pownce).
Sure, there’s the advantage of sniping in an auction situation. Last bidder in an auction always wins, right? But there’s no reason that an impressive marketing effort can’t lead to an implied topping privilege. If they like you, they can always bring you their final best offer for you to consider.
Applying for a job, or to college, or visiting a client to pitch a project–in each case, going first is a significant advantage. Why, then, do so many people wait until the last minute? Why do we insist that this is a strategy, not a mistake?
Fear, of course. Procrastination. It’s easier to wait. The impending deadline gives us the energy to overcome our sales call resistance, forces the committee to get its act together, pushes the project up the priority list. Those are all fine reasons to wait. But don’t pretend it’s good marketing, because it’s not.","December 14, 2008","First mover advantage, marketing strategy, procrastination"
"When you notice it, it’s news","I just read apostthat said that some musicians were reporting that their perfect pitch (the ability to know exactly what a perfect A sounds like) is fading away. What could be causing this?
I don’t think anything is causing it.
Out of every 10,000 musicians, it’s not hard to imagine that throughout history, a few (2, 5, 10?) have had their pitch fade away. But in the old days, we never heard about it. Word didn’t spread. Perhaps you told your husband or the ensemble, but that was the end of it.
As word (about your product or your brand or your career or anything) is amplified and spread, it bumps into other news and becomes a trend.
This is a subtle but huge change in the way we think about the world. The connection of customers and employees and users and citizens and good guys and bad actors and everyone… it means that the way we see and understand information is changed forever.
I would take two things away from this:
1. Just because you heard about something happening for the first time doesn’t mean it’s the first time. It may just mean that it’s the first time it’s been widely reported. Sort of like what happens after you get a digital thermometer in your house–everyone suddenly gets a fever.

Dewey defeats Truman,"Headlines matter now more than they ever did.
Headlines provoke and introduce. They cajole and they position.
No headline, no communication.
This spreadsheet you just sent me… what does it say? What does it mean? It has no headline. Trashed.
That person you met at a conference: What’s his headline? Are you actually going to spend ten minutes with him before you determine whether or not he’s interesting enough to talk with? Of course not. No headline, no communication.
You can have sub-headlinesThe great direct mail copywriter Joe Sugarman taught me this. Every ad had a headline, and so did every paragraph. If the paragraph didn’t warrant a headline, it didn’t go in the ad.
This might be a shameI’m not saying that headline-world is the place we want to or should live in. I’m merely saying that we do live there, and if you want to communicate (your resume, your trustworthiness, your graciousness) you need to be sure your headline is compelling, accurate and a viable foundation to the message you’re ultimately trying to send. (That last one is very important. Just because it gets you newsstand sales doesn’t mean it’s a headline you want to live with.)
Headlines don’t always look like headlines, of course. That outfit you wore to work today is quite a headline, bub. Headlines may not look like they belong in a newspaper, but they always work that way. Now or never.","December 12, 2008","headlines, communication, significance"
You’re not going to win a Pulitzer Prize,"… and neither am I. Nor will any blogger, including those far more deserving.
ThePulitzerfolks, stewards of one of the most influential and important awards in any field, have just announced their new rules. You can win a Pulitzer for commentary online now,but only if the place you post your commentary is a significant news gathering site. You know, sites like MinnPost and Voice of San Diego. So, Tom Friedman can win a well-deserved prize for writing what is essentially a blog for the NY Times, but if he goes off on his own, he’s out.
What a shame.
As newspapers melt all around us, faster and faster, the people in the newspaper business persist in believing that the important element of a news-paper is the paper part.
What an opportunity (for someone) to start taking advantage of the huge pool of talent and passion that is moving online, and to work to raise the bar. We don’t need more gossip sites from celebrity magazine editors. We need to identify and reward voices that push hard against the status quo, that report eagerly and accurately and that speak truth to power.
Here’s what we’re going to miss, and quite soon: the cost of having a printing press and the money to run one meant that there were newspapers with gravitas. Newspapers that invested for the long haul, that stood for something, that spoke up. When you can launch a blog for nothing and disappear quite easily if it doesn’t work, the gravitas is a lot more difficult to find. When the newspapers are gone (and it’s happening a lot faster than the people in the industry are able to admit) that’s what we’re going to miss the most.
The opportunity, then, is to organize and network and identify and reward that activity when it happens online. Not because the site is owned by a paper or because the founder has connections to the old media. No, because they’re doing work that matters.
If I ran the Pulitzers, I’d hand out a dozen more every year to people working exclusively online.","December 11, 2008","Pulitzer Prize, online journalism, newspaper industry"
What to do with your ideas for other people,"Steve wrote me a note pointing out that as a marketer, he’s always coming up with groundbreaking ideas that can help large companies or other marketers. Should he just let them go? Try to sell them? Submit them to the company?
Another reader wrote in complaining about Apple’s insistence that they don’t want to know about your great ideas. They refuse to read them.
You’ve probably been asked to sign a formal NDA document–someone wants to tell you a big secret and you’re not allowed to tell anyone, at least not during this century.
It’s frustrating. You’ve got this great idea, but no one wants it, or they’re going to steal it.
Here’s the essential distinction:Selling ideas is a fundamentally different business than having ideas.
It’s like being a really fast runner but being unwilling to take a hit or unable to block. You may be fast, but you can’t play football. Two different skills are involved, and having one is insufficient. Remember, the selling is a business onto itself, not something that you do after you get a great idea.
If you want to sell ideas to organizations, you need to invest heavily in the skills and status to do that. The quality of ideas is not a factor in whether or not you will be in a position to have a chance to sell those ideas. (That sentence is shocking but true, so reread it).
If you’re unable to be in that position, my best advice is that you blog the ideas. At least you’ll get them out of your system and get bragging rights if anything ever happens.","December 10, 2008","idea selling, marketing, blogging"

Warning: The internet is almost full,"Due to the extraordinary explosion in video, blogs, news feeds and social network postings, the internet is dangerously close to running out of room.
Nothing can grow forever, and exponential growth is always short lived. We’re running out of disk space, so if you have something left to say, better hurry. Once it’s full, it’s full.
Of course, the decentralized nature of the net means that it will never be physically full. As long as we can keep making hard drives, we won’t run out of space to store those inane videos of your Aunt Sally. What is full is our attention.

Lesson learned from my biggest business mistake,"My biggest mistake (at least in terms of income avoided) was not believing in the world wide web in 1994.
It’s not like I didn’t know about it. I had written a book called ""Best of the Net"". I’d even written the cover story for some now-defunct magazine on how to surf the internet. But in those days, the Net referred to Archie and Veronica and the online services… there was no real browser, no search engines to speak of, just a bunch of conferences and some guys in the Valley.
Not only did I ignore it, Iactivelyignored it. I didn’t register hundreds of domain names or build out the website for Yoyodyne beyond much of a placeholder. Instead of expanding my online game show/promotions company into the web, we focused on Microsoft’s Chicago service and Apple’s eWorld. Sigh.
Instead of building a search engine, I wrote a book calledThe Smiley Dictionary. Earnings to date: $10,000 or so.
I’m going into all this painful detail to let you know what an idiot I was. How many clues were just sitting there, how much access I had, how deliberate I was in ignoring them.
Why?
I think the answer is simple: Becausethe rules of this new business didn’t match the rules of my existing business.
Businesses live in ecosystems. A series of rules and assumptions that, taken together, make a thriving mechanism
Example: The oil ecosystem involves prospecting, drilling, transporting, refining, etc. If you don’t understand the role of automobiles or plastics in the oil industry, then you don’t understand the industry. You don’t ‘get it.’ On the other hand, if you understand the ecosystem of automobiles and of oil, then the ecosystem of windmills on homes and hydrogen in cars may be just too weird to grasp.
The ecosystem of the worldwide web was just being filled in. It had some assumptions clearly laid out (no money to view the content) and some waiting to be sketched in (can attention turn into cash?). But for someone in the business of selling books and internet content, this seemed impossible. Different rules, rules I didn’t understand and couldn’t accept.
And that’s where we get stuck. We get stuck because we believe that the rules of our ecosystem are permanent and transferable. In fact, they are almost always temporary and rarely transferable.
My approach now is simple: take a look at the rules of the new ecosystem. Do they make sense? Is it possible they’ll come to pass? If they do, what happens to you?","December 8, 2008","business mistakes, ecosystem, internet evolution"
Pre-steal this book,"This is a long, rambling story with a useful punchline. I posted it on a weekend so you could skip it without feeling guilty. Thanks to my friend Michael for reminding me.
Twenty five years ago, I led the creation of a line ofcomputer adventure gamesin conjunction with major science fiction and mystery authors. Ray Bradbury, Michael Crichton, Erle Stanley Gardner’s estate, etc.
One night, I tookHarry Harrisonout drinking (he drank, I drove). After a few tequilas, Harry announced, ""I don’t speak to Crichton!"" Intrigued, I asked why not. I thought he was a perfectly nice guy.
""Well,"" Harry said, ""I actually have never met him, but if I did meet him, I’d shun him.""
It turns out that Harry had spent six months writing a science fiction novel about a virus that comes from space and wipes out a small town. As he was finishing it,The Andromeda Straincame out and was a mammoth bestseller. Harrison had to throw his manuscript in the trash. He said he was angry that even though Crichton had never heard of or seen his work, he had pre-stolen it. It’s entirely possible that Crichton had spent time imagining what Harry and authors like him would have written next… and then written it.
So, what’s keeping you from pre-stealing my next book, orMalcolm‘s? Why not pre-steal the next great innovation fromKevin Kellyor someone else you admire?

Building an albatross,"I spent hours watching the albatross in the Galapagos hang out. The first thing you notice is that they have a terribly difficult time taking off. In the water, an albatross will have to spend hours waiting for the right wind to come along. On land, they're ungainly, but when they find the right conditions… they take off. And fly and fly and fly. An albatross can fly for days or weeks, with a heart rate similar to its resting heart rate. Possibly the best bird ever invented.
Albatross businesses are great to have but not easy to launch. Rather than the excitement of the big time launch and then the constant promotion and high expense of a typical business, an albatross business mucks around for a while, but since it's designed for effortless long flight, it gains steam and then keeps going.
Today is the third anniversary of the launch ofSquidoointo alpha. We certainly had a slow take off, then a bump in the wind 18 months ago with spammers and the search engines, but we've reached a glide path. Note two things about this chart:
1. It takes three years to be an overnight success, sometimes more.
That means you need to either raise enough money from patient investors to stick it out… or, as in our case, be so lean and efficient that the cost of lasting long enough to make it profitable is one you can handle.
2. It's possible to organize a company around the idea that success breeds success.
Traditional businesses don't do that… if you're a wedding photographer or a restaurant, you're not going to have an albatross business. These businesses need ongoing promotion which leads to ongoing business, and around and around. There's clearly a benefit to reputation and word of mouth, but you're rarely going to see the hockey stick that is the goal of most internet businesses.
The two secrets, I think, are:
1. Plan for the long slow ramp up. That means super low overhead and patience and not trying to launch with a huge splash because you're impatient.
2. Architecture matters. If you intend to build an albatross, you'll want to design a business where each customer brings you new customers, where the more it gets used, the better it works.
We have a  l o n g  way to go before Squidoo hits the stride we're seeking, but on our third anniversary, it seemed like a worthwhile time to take a look of how close we are getting to our flight path. An albatross can achieve a 22:1 glide path–22 meters out for every meter down or up. That's the goal, leverage.

The noise,"It’s noisy and getting noisier.
If you looked at web activity, you could rightfully assume that the web consists largely of porn, gossip, Britney Spears searches, trolls, trivia, anger, complaints, flirting and self-absorption.
If you look at the logs of who is calling your toll free number, you could rightfully come to the conclusion that 92% of your customers are mad at you and the other 8% are merely stupid.
If you look at the ads in the magazines you get, you could understandably come to the conclusion that all people buy is cars, pills and shoes.
The thing is, not all data is equal, and measuring the truth based on volume is almost certain to get you in trouble.
Most voters don’t have a blog. Most of your customers don’t picket your offices. Most people who take Motrin have no idea what Twitter is.
I’m not encouraging you to ignore the noisy edges. Far from it. The noise makes it far easier than it has ever been before to hear the thunder in the distance, to get early indications of what the fringes of the market are about to spread to the rest.
It’s easier than ever to amplify the noise of the edges, to bring it close, make it vivid and immerse yourself in it. You could spend all day watching your name or your brand morph among the loud people online. Just because it’s easy, though, doesn’t mean you have to do it at full blast.
What I’m encouraging you to do is to constantly readjust your balance. Figure out the difference between early warnings and selfish noise. Figure out what’s loud merely because it’s angry and personal, and what’s loud because it’s important.

Making vs. Taking,"Consider two cereals:
Honey Bunches of Oats, a category creator, a big brand with spin offs and profits and growth.
Fruit Harvest, a generically named cereal that leverages the marketing department’s ability to run coupons, grab shelf space and take share.
That’s the choice most of us make when we launch a product or service. We can make a market or we can take share from a market.
""This is just like the Gillette razor, but cheaper.""
""This has a touch screen, too, but you can get it from Verizon.""
""I’m a shiatsu massage therapist, the only one on this block.""
Those are ‘taking’ statements. They break a larger market into smaller bits. Compare to:
""This is a sugared cereal for adults.""
""Our software enables you to find data and trends that no one else can find.""
""By combining protein and chocolate, we’ve developed a new food that’s both dessert and dinner.""
These are ‘making’ statements. Riskier, sure, but they stand for something, they don’t just steal share. The Dummies guides made a market, the Idiot’s guides took from that market.
