A website that\u2019s good enough. Not that breaks new ground, establishes a new identity, discovers new ways for people to interact online. Just a good enough website that didn\u2019t kill you to launch.\nTo be clear, the following advice assumes that:\nSo, here\u2019s what you do. First, realize that traditionally, the jobof designer has been linked with the job of programmer. There were verygood reasons for this. Designing a page that can\u2019t work is silly, andchanging the design every time you change the way the page works can betime consuming and expensive.\nAs a result, web design became a sacred art, one done only by theblessed few, in caverns far away from where mortals tread. In addition,it became expensive, because design changes (which marketers love tomake) got in the same queue as programming changes.\nWe need to start by divorcing the two practices. There\u2019s no longer areally good reason for the two to be so closely linked, especiallysince disciplined use of CSS and testing pays such dividends.\nStart with design. Don\u2019t involve the programming team until you\u2019re90% done with the look and feel of your pages. It\u2019s cheap to changedesign if it can\u2019t by supported by programming, and cheaper and fasterto have design done in Photoshop before you commit to cutting it up andcoding it.\nI\u2019m going to go out on a limb and beg younotto create an originaldesign. There are more than a billion pages on the web. Surely there\u2019sone that you can start with? If your organization can\u2019t find a website that you all agree can serve as a model, you need to stop right now and find a new job.\nNot a site to rip-off, but an inspiration. Fonts and colors and layout. The line spacing. The interactions. Whynot? Your car isn\u2019t unique, and your house might not be either. Ifyou\u2019ve got a site that sells 42 kinds of wrapping paper, why not startby finding a successful site that sells\u2026 I don\u2019t know, shoes oryo-yo\u2019s\u2026 something that both appeals to your target audience and hasbeen tested and tweaked and works. No, don\u2019t pick a competitor. Thatwill get you busted. Pick a reasonably small but successful site in atotally different line of work. Say to your designer: \"That\u2019s ourstarting point. Don\u2019t change any important design element withoutasking me first. Now, pull in our products, our logo and our companycolor scheme and let\u2019s take a look at it.\"\nAt this point, some people are aghast! Shouldn\u2019t the web be a design contest on top of everything else? I don\u2019t think so.\nNow, take your finished Photoshop pages and get every single personwho can possibly veto your project to say okay. THEN give it toengineering to make it work.\n[Boy, am I in trouble. People hate posts like this one. They read all sorts of things into it that I don\u2019t intend. I\u2019m certainly not against bespoke design, or designers. I certainly don\u2019t believe that all engineers are bad designers or even difficult to deal with. The point of the post is most definitelynotto encourage you to commit copyright violations or even ethical ones. It merely works to recognize two things:\n1. If you are unable to agree on an existing site, you are sure going to spend a lot of time and money trying to agree on a custom one.\n2. The process of design and user interaction is best done separately from the process of server speed, database structure and uptime.\nForgive me!]"}]}

You can ignore it, but it will cost you, because the world won\u2019t work the way you hope it will. You can dislike the truth, but pretending it isn\u2019t true isn\u2019t an effective way to accomplish your goals or to further our culture.\nMost of the kinds of truth we experience are about the past and the present, and these are the easiest to see and confirm, but there are also truths about cause and effect.\nIdentityis the truth of description. A circle is round because we define a circle as round. You can say, \u201ca circle is rectangular in shape,\u201d and all you\u2019ve done is confused us. Words only work because we agree on what they mean.\nDemagogues often play with the identity of words, as it distracts us.\nAxiomatictruth is truth about the system. The Peano axioms, for example, define the rules of arithmetic. They are demonstrably true and the system is based on these truths. Einstein derived his theories of special and general relativity with a pad of paper, not with an experiment (though the experiments that followed have demonstrated that his assertions were in fact true.)\nThere were loud voices in mid-century Germany who said that Einstein\u2019s work couldn\u2019t be true because of his heritage, and many others who mis-described his work and then decried that version of it, but neither approach changed the ultimate truth of his argument.\nAxiomatic truth, like most other truths, doesn\u2019t care whether you understand it or believe it or not. It\u2019s still true.\nHistorictruth is an event that actually happened. We know it happened because it left behind evidence, witnesses and other proof.\nExperimentaltruth may not have the clear conceptual underpinnings of axiomatic truth, but it holds up to scrutiny. The world is millions of years old. Every experiment consistently demonstrates this. Experimental truth can also give us a road map to the future. Vaccines do not cause autism. The world is not flat. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is rising.\nIf you want to challenge an experimental truth, the only response is to do a better experiment, make it replicable and show your work.\nPersonalexperiencetruth is the truth that\u2019s up to you. How you reacted to what happened can only be seen and reported by you.\nAnd finally, considerculturaltruth, and this is the truth thatcanchange. This is the truth of, \u201cpeople like us do things like this.\u201d Which is true, until it\u2019s not. And then people like us do something else."}]}

A big label could reach the dozens of music reviewers, and do it with credibility.

You wouldn\u2019t stand up in the middle of a Broadway play and start selling insurance from the audience. Don\u2019t do it with your keyboard.

We know this intuitively in the real world (a letter is different from a phone call) but online, it\u2019s profound. A discussion board isn\u2019t the same as a Zoom call. It turns out that we can create rich and layered conversations with async communication, but we also have to be just a bit more patient.\nLeap 3: More than one person can \u2018talk\u2019 at a time. In the real world, that\u2019s impossible. At a table for six, we take turns talking. But in a chat room, we can all talk at the same time. Use it well and you can dramatically increase information exchange. But if you try to follow all the threads, or you miss what you need, then it\u2019s actually less effective.\nLeap 4: Sometimes we leave a trail. Most real-life conversations are inherently off the record because the words disappear right after we say them. But if you use a keyboard, or you\u2019re attached to a server, assume you\u2019re being recorded and act appropriately.

He asked me for my thoughts about museums and marketing, something to go along with a book or two that would be read by participants at the seminars.\nI wrote,\nHi James,\nMy mom, before she passed away, was treasurer of the Museum Store Association, which was very important to her.\nWe\u2019re members of the Museum of Natural History, used to go frequently to the Liberty Science Center, have been to the Hudson River Museum, the Cropsey Foundation, the Tenement Museum, the Cooper Union, The Guggenheim, The Whitney, etc. [I left out the big museums, which we go to every month or so]\nI think in every single case, what keeps museums from being remarkable:\na. the curators think the item on display is the whole thing. As a result, they slack off and do less than they should in creating an overall story\nb. they assume that visitors are focused, interested and smart. They are rarely any of the three. As a result, the visit tends to be a glossed over one, not a deep one or a transcendent one\nc. science museums in particular almost beg people NOT to think.\nI can\u2019t remember the last time a museum visit made my cry, made me sad or made me angry (except at the fact that they don\u2019t try hard enough).James was nice enough to write back with a summary from one of the people at the seminar:\nThe book discussion started off with my asking if they were surprised we had selected these books.\u00a0 The consensus was no, not really, but about a third of the readers clearly hated the books.\u00a0 Not for what they said so much, but they felt that he was not speaking about museums, his stuff did not apply to museums, or that it was all obvious anyway.\nWell, that got the conversation going because then the people who liked the books acknowledged that overall, he was right.\u00a0 And that yes, it is obvious stuff, but they (museum professionals) get so wrapped up in museum work that this is exactly the stuff they miss.\u00a0 I asked if it was a case of missing the forest for the trees and they said yes.\u00a0 They went around in circles a bit, and then I shared Seth\u2019s comments on museums specifically.\u00a0 Oh, they had a field day with that.\nThey asked how long it had been since he had been to a museum.\u00a0 But the group that liked his books spoke up pretty quickly, and first acknowledged that he was trying to needle them, but then said \u2013 wait, he is part of our audience, and clearly he has thought this.\u00a0 And if we are not listening to our audiences, then we may not be doing our jobs well at all.\u00a0 This was bounced around for a while.\u00a0 At the end I pulled it back towards Godin\u2019s books and asked what, if anything, they got from the books, felt like they could take back to their museums and use, or share with their bosses.\u00a0 Even a couple of the Godin-haters mentioned things they got from them.\u00a0 After the book club, back at the cabin we were staying in, there was a lot of talking around the fireplace about branding and stories, so it was clear the books, and the discussion, made them think.\nWhile I\u2019m not thrilled that there are Godin-haters out there, I guess that goes with the territory. The takeaway for me is that in fact the issues of storytelling and remarkability and respect are universal, whether you\u2019re a non-profit or a job-seeker. It\u2019s all people, all the time."}]}

The reason this system evolved is straightforward: the yes people are rare in a typical organization, because they have responsibility and power. So they are busy and need to be protected. The no people are easy to train at saying no, and they're waiting to be promoted to yes people. And the stallers? They represent the dip, the barrier salespeople have to get through to show that they are serious.\nThis is true for all business to business selling, but I think it's worthwhile to consider ad sales.\nIn today's long tail new media world, I think that marketers that rely on this system are failing. When there were only a few media options worth considering when placing an ad, the stalling, no-ing and eventually yes-please system didn't hurt them much. NBC had the wherewithal to get through the system. Yahoo and AOL organized to get through it as well. A marketer could just arrogantly wait for the best salespeople and buy ads from them and succeed.\nNow, though, there are thousands of sites that could offer your organization targeted, efficient media that would pay off handsomely at the price you are willing to buy it.\nLook at it from the blogger's point of view: If you're a blogger, would you sell a monthly sponsorship on your blog for $2,000? $20,000? Probably, and it would be a bargain for both sides. But you don't even try, because the overhead is huge.The cost of selling that sponsorship is more than you'd earn.\nSo, Visa, a stalling marketer, spent a million or more dollars on a very expensive, complex and largely ineffective online promotion last month\u2013not because it was likely to work, but because it was well sold by persistent and effective salespeople. They should have sponsored your blog and 400 others instead.\nThe opportunity for marketers in search of media is not to play defense, to stall people with clever ideas or small platforms, but instead to stop stalling and start looking. The bargains are there, just waiting."}]}

I wrote a column for Fast Company about a different kind of MBA. I\u2019ve gotten tons of email about it, most of it positive\u2013but I did get one particularly desperate/angry note from a validation-seeking student last week. Coincidentally, I just received this beautiful diploma, suitable for framing, for Dan Limbach, who volunteered to share it with you.]\n[here\u2019s the original article, with a few updates in brackets]\nI thought maybe I\u2019d open a business school. This is particularly ironic given my past: No student in the history of the Stanford Graduate School of Business has ever come closer to not receiving an MBA than yours truly.\nWhen I was at Stanford (it seems like decades ago \u2014 probably because it was), I thought that the environment there was terrific, and I truly enjoyed some of my classes. But before the start of my second year, I got an irresistible job offer \u2014 which prompted me to try to go to school and work at the same time. I soon realized that the classes were in Palo Alto, and the job was in Boston. But, thanks to some help from TWA and a bizarre willingness on my part to fly on the red-eye, I managed to commute for a semester. After that, a kindly professor decided to stop the madness and just give me the rest of my credits, so graduate I did.\nDespite my less-than-stellar attendance record at business school, I\u2019ve since found that teaching business is a blast. I taught a class to second-year students at NYU this year and discovered that aggravating 90 soon-to-be-graduating students is great fun. I had so much fun, in fact, that I started thinking about what business school is, what it\u2019s good for \u2014 and what it\u2019s not good for at all.\nAs far as I can tell, there are only three reasons to apply to business school. My [imaginary] school, the New Order Business School (NoBS), will focus on excelling at all three.\nFirst, business school provides a tremendous screen for future employers. If you go to Harvard Business School, for example, you are doing a tremendous thing for your personal branding, and you are guaranteed a job interview \u2014 at the very least \u2014 virtually anywhere in the world. When it comes to business, Columbia, Stanford, Wharton, and a few other schools aspire to Harvard\u2019s level. And in some industries, they even surpass it.\nJust as Internet investors have successfully trained themselves to look past the present and to invest in companies that have a wonderful future, some employers have realized that waiting for someone to graduate from one of these august institutions is a waste of time. Instead of hiring students after they finish classes (which, after all, don\u2019t teach why the brand is so valuable), why not just hire people as soon as they\u2019ve been accepted to business school?\nThe student who drops out of school after getting in but before beginning classes saves about $55,000 in tuition \u2014 as well as another $180,000 in opportunity cost. Add to that the stock options and a chance to change the world that much sooner, and you can see why this is a no-brainer for all involved.\nAt NoBS, we offer a special program for just this sort of student. Basically, it\u2019s the most exclusive business-school admissions program in the country. We guarantee that only one out of every 1,000 applicants will be accepted to our school. And we guarantee that upon being accepted, every single person will receive at least three job offers \u2014 each with a minimum salary of $65,000 a year.\nThe fee to have your application considered is $300. After all, as an admissions-based institution \u2014 actually, as an admissions-only institution \u2014 we have to do a great job, so it\u2019s $300 well spent.\nThere are few classes. There is no degree. You apply. You get in (or, more likely, you don\u2019t). That\u2019s it. We\u2019re done. (Oh, and by the way, the profit margins are huge! But you figured that out already.)\nThink about the prestige associated with being the one in 1,000. Think about the pride in knowing that you are one of the few people smart enough, motivated enough, and crazy enough to apply to a school that exclusive. Stuck in a dead-end job? Work like crazy on your GMATS and your essay, and you too may be able to break through the clutter of applicants and become a NoBS standout.\nThe second reason that people go to school is to build a network. This is another way of saying that there\u2019s a social insurance policy among students. If someone in your class actually becomes successful or lands a powerful job, the rest of you have someone to go to for favors or even cash.\nIt\u2019s sort of astonishing how powerful networking can be. One investor I know gives preference to companies whose staff includes an alumnus of Camp Tahigwa. Employees don\u2019t necessarily have to have attended Camp Tahigwa at the same time that the investor did \u2014 so long as they know the same camp songs.\nAt NoBS, we offer a concentrated program, half of which focuses on just this sort of networking. Rather than waiting for networking to occur through random osmosis \u2014 through unpredictable events like working on a project together in Cost Accounting 101 \u2014 students at NoBS gather for two weeks every six months to engage in some intense team building. They row crew. They play chess. They build houses for the disadvantaged. They stay up all night putting a VW Beetle on the roof of Larry Ellison\u2019s home.\nThe third (and least important) reason to go to business school is actually to learn something. And this is where traditional business schools really fail. The core curriculum at business schools is as close to irrelevant as you can imagine. If you and I were trying to create a series of courses that would all but guarantee that upon graduating, students would have no useful knowledge about how to do business in the new economy, today\u2019s business-school curriculum would be a great model for us.\nSo eliminating the curriculum may be a great idea. But sooner or later, the illusion of a thriving, useful institution will fade if a business school doesn\u2019t offer any courses. Ask people who are thriving in today\u2019s economy to name five things that helped them succeed, and they\u2019ll probably come up with a list like this one.\n1. Finding, hiring, and managing super-great people\n2. Embracing change and moving quickly\n3. Understanding and excelling at business development and at making deals with other companies\n4. Prioritizing tasks in a job that changes every day\n5. Selling \u2014 to people, to companies, and to markets\nThere are other skills that might show up on the list \u2014 for example, balancing a life for the long term, working with venture capitalists and other sources of funds, being creative, and understanding the impact of new technologies \u2014 but this is a good starting place.\nNow take a look at the core curriculum for a $55,000 MBA. You\u2019ll find virtually no focus at all on any of these five issues. My MBA students at NYU had never taken a selling course, they had never been taught how to give a presentation, but they were experts in cost accounting, in understanding manufacturing efficiencies, and in applying the Black and Scholes Option Pricing Formula.\nPeople in the real world buyhow-to booksto figure out how to succeed. So the NoBS curriculum includes only courses that are worthy of being the subject of a best-selling book. And whenever possible, the authors themselves teach the courses. (In fact, my facetiousness aside, you can learn 100% of the MBA curriculum at home, in a month, just by reading books. I\u2019ll go one step further: I can condense an hour of class presentation into 10 book pages. If you can discipline yourself to read, you can free up two years of your life for the good stuff!)\nThe last thing to consider about business school is that in many cases, precisely the wrong people attend. Instead of filling their classrooms with people who are too kind to go to law school, business schools ought to find people who are already in the business world, but who are panicking because they don\u2019t know as much as they want to know. Instead of looking for people who are working two mind-numbing years at a bank while waiting to get into a top institution, schools ought to seek out entrepreneurs who are champing at the bit to get their businesses started.\nThere are two kinds of people who don\u2019t belong in business school: the talented folks who are in too much of a hurry to spend time studying and the dull ones who don\u2019t have anything better to do.\nThe paradox, of course, is that the best people aren\u2019t prepared to leave their life behind for two years. They\u2019re in a hurry.\nSo at NoBS, students only need to attend classes for four weeks every six months. The rest of the school runs online for two hours every day. And the MBA is completed in less than a year.\nDuring the four weeks of live stuff, we all fly to some off-season ski resort with excellent food, decent rooms, and an Olympic-sized swimming pool. Classes run from 8 am to midnight, three days a week. The rest of the week, students teach one another from real-life anecdotes. Sharing life experiences prepares people for the arrival of unexpected events.\nThe \u201cfaculty\u201d isn\u2019t really a faculty at all. There are no PhDs in the bunch \u2014 not one. Instead, our teachers are compelling public speakers, the kind of people who get standing ovations. People like Zig Ziglar on selling, Tom Peters on embracing change, or Regis McKenna on public relations.\nSound like a powerful experience? Totally nonaccredited. No bureaucracy. One dean. Drop out if you want. Do it for the learning, not for the grades. Everybody is as motivated as you are. Get it over with in just nine months. Walk out with a great credential and 100 lifelong friends.\nIs NoBS yet another bizarre thought exercise on my part? Probably. [for the irony-impaired: yes]\nNoBS is worth considering. Before you go to business school, before you decide that a fancy MBA is the one thing standing between you and success, you ought to think really hard about why you\u2019re going and what you\u2019re going to learn.\nAnd that, of course, goes double for any company itching to hire the latest freshly minted MBA. Perhaps instead of letting a 300-year-old institution do your screening for you, you should start your own business school. Bring in 100 kids. Put them through the real curriculum in four weeks. Keep half, and pay the other half a year of severance (or have them lick envelopes until they find another job).\nIt\u2019s easy to forget that business school is a thoroughly modern phenomenon \u2014 that it\u2019s not rooted in the ancient canons of Shakespeare or even Madame Curie. Most modern business schools were founded in the 1960s. Their time has come and gone.\n[Updated in 2020, twenty years after I wrote this original rant.Since then, thealtMBAhas turned into a legitimate life-changing institution. 5,000 graduates from more than seventy countries. From companies large and small. From non-profits, educational institutions and government agencies. From age 16 to 80.\nThe altMBA is now independent of its founder, part of a B corp. organized to work in the public interest, owned and run by a passionate team of change-makers, and most important, attended by people who know that there\u2019s something more to work.\nNo gurus, no tests, no focus on scarcity. Instead, it\u2019s a chance to learn together and to make a difference.]"}]}

I know, I know, I just published abook. I\u2019m breaking the biggest rule in publishing. I\u2019m trying your patience by doing another book so soon, but it really couldn\u2019t wait. The new book is on a totally different topic, and it\u2019s a lot longer and filled with examples and stuff. It\u2019s about the internet and new marketing and the fourteen trends that change everything.\nEvery Monday for the next few months I\u2019m going to publish a thought piece from the book. We\u2019ll start with the basic premise then move on to the fourteen trends in the book. Here goes:\nWhat\u2019s a meatball sundae?\nMaybe this is familiar. It is to me, anyway:\nYou go to a marketing meeting. There\u2019s a presentation from the new Internet marketing guy. He\u2019s brought a fancy (and expensive) blogging consultant with him. She starts talking about how blogs and the \u201cWeb 2.0 social media infrastructure\u201d are just waiting for your company to dive in. \u201cTry this stuff,\u201d she seems to be saying, \u201cand the rest of your competitive/structural/profit issues will disappear.\u201d\nIn the last ten years, the Internet and radical changes in media have provided marketers everywhere with a toolbox that allows them to capture attention with seemingly little effort, planning, or cash. Six years after the dot-com boom, there are more Web sites, more email users, and more viral ideas, online and offline, than ever before. There are hundreds of cable TV networks and thousands of online radio stations. Not to mention street marketing, email marketing, and MySpace.\nCorporations, political parties, nonprofits, job-seekers, and yes, even people looking for love are all scrambling around, trying to exploit the power of these new tools. People treat the New Marketing like a kid with a twenty-dollar bill at an ice cream parlor. They keep wanting to add more stuff\u2014more candy bits and sprinkles and cream and cherries. The dream is simple: \u201cIf we can just add enough of [today\u2019s hot topping], everything will take care of itself.\u201d\nMost of the time, despite all the hype, organizations fail when they try to use this scattershot approach. They fail to get buzz or traffic or noise or sales. Organizations don\u2019t fail because the Web and the New Marketing don\u2019t work. They fail because the Web and the New Marketing work only when applied to the right organization. New Media makes a promise to the consumer. If the organization is unable to keep that promise, then it fails.\nNew Marketing\u2014whipped cream and a cherry on top\u2014isn\u2019t magical. What\u2019s magical is what happens when an organization uses the New Marketing to become something it didn\u2019t used to be\u2014it\u2019s not just the marketing that\u2019s transformed, but the entire organization. Just as technology propelled certain organizations through the Industrial Revolution, this new kind of marketing is driving the right organizations through the digital revolution.\nYou can become the right organization. You can align your organization from the bottom up to sync with New Marketing, and you can transform your organization into one that thrives on the new rules."}]}

Belief is our tool to dance with a possible future, confront our fears, and build community. Our personal taste and our preferences belong to us as well, helping us believe in ourselves.\nFor millennia, belief thrived in most parts of our lives. We didn\u2019t need belief to know that fire was hot (it always is), but it certainly gave us hope and solace in the face of the unknown. And the unknown is where belief thrives\nBut resistance to knowing isn\u2019t a useful habit. When Ignaz Semmelweis used statistics to prove that hand washing by doctors would save the lives of mothers giving birth, doctors who believed they knew better ignored it, causing countless deaths. When researchers showed that many ulcers are caused by bacteria, doctors who practiced with long-earned belief resisted the data for decades. And when experts in any field fight against research that might undermine their status, they\u2019re doing their belief and those who trust them a disservice.\nThere\u2019s more proof in the world than ever before, not less.

We have statistical proof of what people click on and how humans respond in a double-blind test.\nThis doesn\u2019t make belief less important. In fact, as proof shows up in one area, it simply gives us the opportunity to bring belief somewhere else, somewhere we can put it to good use. Personal taste, placebos and the way we dance with the unknown future are powerful ways to connect, to express ourselves and to find solace.\nBut the time we spend arguing about proof that we\u2019re not prepared to accept is simply wasted. Belief needs proof the way a fish needs a bicycle."}]}

Many authors have one. Erle Stanley Gardner, one of the most successful authors of all time, dictacted each Perry Mason book to his secretary, who wrote them out. It took 21 days for each book, and he didn't even need to edit them.\nI confess to not having a process. Some books, likeThe Dip, were created Gardner-style (without the secretary part). I wroteIdeavirusin less than ten days. I might think about a topic for months or years, but then, whoosh, there's a book.\nThat's not what happened with this book. I grew up with science fiction, and one of the elements I like about the best novels is the way the author establishes a few assumptions about the way of the world and then explores the implications of those assumptions.Duneis a fine example of this, as are Asimov's Robot novels.\nAfter writingUnleashing the Ideavirus, I was reading a lot of books about memetics, evolution and evolutionary biology. A few (likeThe Red QueenandDarwin's Dangerous Idea) were profound in their eloquence and implications. It seemed to me that combining memetics (the analysis of the evolution and spread of ideas) with modern thinking about evolution could give us new insight into how organizations work.\nAnd so I headed down the rabbit hole. Eight hours a day for a year. I read hundreds of books, filled notebooks with ideas and wrote more than 600 pages, less than half of which I ended up using. The result is certainly the book I've worked hardest on, and perhaps not coincidentally, the book that sold the fewest copies. So few that my publisher took the unusual step of firing me, showing no interest whatever in my next book,Purple Cow.\nThere were probably two reasons thatSurvivaldidn't do very well. The first is that it came out right after 9/11, when much of the nation was grieving. The second: science fiction novels lend themselves to complexity, new vocabulary and flights of theory. Popular business books, not so much.\nAt one level, every author writes for himself. I'm proud of my process here, of how hard I was able to push on this book and how much I learned doing it. On the other hand, we write for our readers, and my readers told me that more concrete examples and fewer footnotes were the way to go if I was intent on starting conversations and fostering positive change.\nThe goal in blogging/business/inspiring non-fiction is to share a truth, or at least a truth as the writer sees it. To not just share it, but to spread it and to cause change to happen. You can do that in at least three ways: with research (your own or reporting on others), by building and describing conceptual structures, or with stories that resonate.\nBothLinchpinandIcarusfound me returning to a more heavily-researched approach to writing. It's exhausting, but the work is its own reward. The process is a choice, though. Youcanwrite without becoming a monk, by bringing your voice to those that want to hear it.\nThe biggest takeaway for anyone seeking to write is this: don't go looking for the way other authors do their work. You won't find many who are consistent enough to copy, and there are enough variations in approach that it's obvious that it's not like hitting home runs or swinging a golf club. There isn't a standard approach, there's only what works for you (and what doesn't).\nIn thewordsmy late friend Isaac Asimov shared with Carl Sagan, \"You are my idea of a good writer because you have an unmannered style, and when I read what you write, I hear you talking.\"\nThe process advice that makes sense to me is to write. Constantly. At length. Often. Don't publish everything you write, but the more you write, the more you have to choose from."}]}

Most of them have publishing houses (and at least a tenuous connection to a publicist). What a great marketing problem. The long tail of authors meets the long tail of public interest. How do they intersect?\nThis is a challenge to authors. Since I know a lot of them (and since many I don\u2019t know read this blog) I thought I\u2019d do it here.\nAuthors like to read.\nThey also like to write.\nAuthors hate to promote themselves. And lots of authors don\u2019t like the web so much, at least when it comes to promotion. It\u2019s not like traveling to an independent bookstore and having tea with the owner while you sign books, or being interviewed for the book section of theTimes.Your favorite author probably doesn\u2019t have a blog, probably doesn\u2019t spend all her time online.\nSo, instead of a significant web presence that\u2019s author-driven, we end up with publishers building their own promo sites (this onehas just 40 (!) authors and cost a fortune to build) or we get publishers insisting that all their authors build MySpace pages (just last week, in fact).\nThere are a few problems with this publisher-first approach. The first is that few readers know which authors are published by which publishers, so there\u2019s no way they\u2019re going to visit a particular site. The second is that authors aren\u2019t going to spend the time to build (and maintain) fancy pages. The third is that because publishers have (legal/sales) trouble picking one bookseller over another, it\u2019s really hard to close the sale and sell the book.\nI think at the heart of this is the declining value of silos.\nPublishers, like many organizations, want to control the conversation, want to own the web page, want to be sure that people come to them, as opposed to going where people are. The irony here is that bookstores are precisely the opposite of this. There\u2019s no Knopf bookstore, no Random House store. Bookstores, unlike the current conception of car dealers, work best when they are agnostic about what\u2019s for sale.\nAuthors are brands. Some are billion-dollar brands, some are tiny ones. The web is custom made for authors, but so far, it\u2019s largely going unused.\nWhich brings us toSquidwho.Since we launched it a month ago, people have added more than 7,000 biographies. And most of them, alas, aren\u2019t authors. We\u2019ve got movie stars and politicians and yes, JK Rowling. I wish I had been surprised and had discovered scores of my fellow authors there, but alas, no.\nBooks aren\u2019t the universal medium they used to be, but the industry still ought to be selling more books than we are today. I\u2019m afraid that publishers and authors have embraced a broken system, even though there are tools out there ready to help.\nWhen I set out to build my page onPhilip Roth, I discovered some very cool interviews, videos and entries about him. But no one had pulled it all together. No one made it easy to figure out what to buy and why. Forgive me for promoting my own project, but Squidwho just feels right to me. Useful and profitable and easy.\nSo, here\u2019s the challenge.If you\u2019re an editor, an agent, a publisher, an author or a fan, gobuild a pageabout an author you like. Or yourself. The worst thing that will happen is you\u2019ll sell a ton of books and raise some money for charity."}]}

They need his writing. He delivers a lot of value. And yet, it's going to take years (if ever) before he reaches them. That's because this market doesn't seek out new ideas, doesn't leave comments on blogs, doesn't spend a lot of time urging others to check out this new thing. He's spending all his focus on this market, and they're not repaying his focus with their attention.\nThe middle of the market is the home of Sinatra, Diamond, and Streisand. There's an endless list of others that would like to break in, but it rarely happens. The leading edge of the market is a lot smaller, but far easier to cater to, because those folks are looking and listening and talking. The middle will catch up, eventually, but that doesn't mean you have to bet on them.\nIn mypostyesterday, I talked about the temptation to merely pander to the geeks. It's not that difficult to write a blog, for example, that repeatedly shows up on Digg or Reddit. The thing is, this audience is fickle and they don't often convert into paying customers or long-term fans. It's not that difficult to be haute couture, to be fashionable, cutting edge or fickle. What's difficult is figuring out how to make it pay.\nI'm not talking about compromising or dumbing down your product. A very hot hot sauce is remarkable. A sort of hot one is boring, and no one, not even the geeks will talk about it. I'm talking about designing products that are simultaneously remarkableandpalatable to people in the middle of the market.\nThe middle of the market is a paradox because of the inherent contradiction between the ease of reaching the nerds and the geeks and the need to reach the middle. The solution, if there is one, is to enter a market to the enthusiastic cheers of those in search of the new, but to build a product/service that appeals to those in the middle. After the initial wave of enthusiasm, you hunker down and ignore those that first embraced you, obsessing instead on the needs and networks of the middle. It's a difficult balancing act, but it's the only one that works.\nUltimately, you end up disappointing the hard core that first found you, but because of their initial enthusiasm (and more important, because you designed your work for the masses in the first place), your productcrossesthe chasm and reaches a larger group. The formula starts with a service or product that's purple enough to spread, but not so hyper-fashionable that it merely entertains the insiders."}]}

It has nothing to do with packaging and a bit more to do with books, but it's a great gig and there are useful lessons, because there are dozens of industries just waiting for you to do something like this. Let me explain:\nA book packager is like a movie producer, but for books. You invent an idea, find the content and the authors, find the publisher and manage the process. Book packagers make almanacs, illustrated books, series books for kids and the goofy one-off books you find at the cash register. I did everything from a line of almanacs to a book on spot and stain removal. It was terrific fun, and in a good year, a fine business. Along the way, I worked with just about every major publisher and created more than a hundred books. I packaged (with various levels of success) video games, college professors, Julia Robert's astrologer, an award-winning children's novelist, the Weekly World News, Kinko's and (almost) Craftsmen Tools.\nI think there are real advantages to this model (and not just for books). Star Wars toys, for example, were created by a packager, and so are most big budget movies. Duncan Hines licensed his name to Roy Park, perhaps the most successful food packager of all time. Roy died of old age with more than half a billion dollars to his name thanks to all that cake mix.\nFirst, the world needs packagers. Packagers that can find isolated assets and connect them in a way that creates value, at the same time that they put in the effort to actually ship the product out of the door.\u00a0 Kaplan might never have gotten into the test prep book business if we hadn't done all the hard work of persuading them to enter the market (it took several years) and creating the books that launched their line. One series of books generated tens of thousands of new customers for them.\nSecond, in many industries there are 'publishers' who need more products to sell. Any website with a lot of traffic and a shopping cart can benefit from someone who can assemble products that they can profitably sell. Apple uses the iPhone store to publish apps. It's not a perfect analogy, because they're not taking any financial risk, but the web is now creating a new sort of middleman who can cheaply sell a product to the end user. We also see this with Bed, Bath and Beyond commissioning products for their stores, or Trader Joe's doing it with food items.\nAny time you can successfully bring together people who have a reputation or skill with people who sell things, you're creating value. If you find an appropriate scale, it can become a sustainable, profitable business.\nThe skills you bring to the table are vision, taste and a knack for seeing what's missing. You also have to be a project manager, a salesperson and the voice of reason, the person who brings the entire thing together and to market without it falling apart. Like so many of the businesses that are working now, it doesn't take much cash, it merely takes persistence and drive.\nHere are some basic rules of thumb that I learned the hard way:"}]}

That\u2019s tragic news\u2014it always is when something like this happens.\nBut why the panic?\nWhy the front page headlines in New York (no sharks here)? Why the emergency orders and the closed beaches?\nLast year there were 30 shark attacks in Florida. This is fewer than the number of people killed by deer accidents (not deer attacks) in the United States. Fewer than the number of people killed in just a few hours of Labor Day traffic. Yet you don\u2019t see people paying money to see movies about killer deer, or fretting about driving to see Aunt Sue.\nShark attackis likecancer.The phrase alone gets you to sit up and take notice, to have a sharp intake of breath, to hope that everything is okay.\nCancer kills about as many Americans as heart disease, but we react completely differently to news about a friend or a colleague with one disease or the other. We ostracize smokers but few people are serious enough about heart disease to become vegetarians\u2026 very different reactions to similar disease-causing lifestyle choices.\nThe new thing to be irrationally frightened of is terrorism. But of course, this isn\u2019t a discussion about rational thought\u2014it\u2019s about worldview. For whatever reason, human beings are hyper-alert to certain things. We\u2019re afraid of snakes and pit bulls, but not three wheeled go kart ATVs.\nAwareness of worldview is critical in world affairs and in marketing as well (same thing, if you ask me). Books about dieting sell, butbooksabout avoiding heart disease don\u2019t. Not because one book is inherently more valuable than the other, but because deep down, consumers believe that a book can help with losing weight (turns out it probably won\u2019t) but a book on heart disease is probably not worth seeking out (big mistake).\nOne thing you can do as a marketer is rail against worldview. You can whine and complain that your service or product is better, pays for itself, saves lives, improves democracies, whatever. Whining, as we see over and over, has little impact.\nFor a while, an important corporate worldview revolved around quality. You could sell most anything under the cover of a story about improving ISO 9000/six sigma/Deming quality. Then we had the deep-seated desire (and big budgets) associated with the Y2K problem. Like most worldviews, this was a worldview that got there before most marketers arrived at the scene. Smart marketers used the opportunity to start a conversation and then tell a story and sell a product that companies actually needed in the long run\u2014and turned that window into a long-term business. Others just manipulated the system and took the money and ran. Those guys are no longer around.\nSame thing happened with web mania. The need to avoid the shark attack of missing the boat pushed change-resistant consumers and corporations to invest in all manner of web stuff. Some companies (like Yahoo!) turned that into a foundation for a real company. Others are long gone.\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m being harsh\u2026 I\u2019ve seen far too many great ideas fail to believe that I\u2019m being cynical in this post.You may have the greatest thing ever, but if it doesn\u2019t match a prevailing worldview in the market where you hope to tell your story, you\u2019re invisible.\nAll Marketers are Liarswas probably a dumb title for my latest book (if my goal was to sell a lot, fast). It doesn\u2019t do a good job of matching the worldview of the people most likely to buy it or talk about it. Perhaps I should have called it, \u201cThe Orange Kangaroo: How Smart Marketers Tell Stories People Want to Believe.\u201d Same book, different worldview. To be fair, my goal wasn\u2019t to write a sequel, though, it was to change minds\u2013which is a very time-consuming and difficult thing to do.\nIf you don\u2019t have the energy or the time to change minds, though, what should you do? You need to realize that changing a worldview requires you to get your prospects to admit that they were wrong. This is awfully hard to do.\nI think that tapping into a worldview almost always requires more than a new title or a new wrapper or a new ad. I think it requires rethinking the product itself, starting from scratch with the worldview in mind.\nIf you could start over, what story would you tell?\nVarious footnotes: On my way through security at LGA today, I saw a display that indicated it was against the law to carry on or pack mouse poison. Not sure why you\u2019d want to do that, but I\u2019m also not sure why it\u2019s a bad idea to have it in your luggage. Could it be the \u201cnational security\u201d worldview at work? Also worth noting that in just eight hours, the death toll in Rwanda was equal to the tragic enormity of the losses of 9/11. And this went on for 24 hours a day, for 100 days and almost no one noticed. Because of worldview. Also worth noting that according to Tom Peters, 100,000 Americans check into a hospital every year\u2026 and don\u2019t check out. Because of infections or other illnesses caused by the system, not by their condition. There is no outcry, no big budgets. Because of worldview."}]}

If you walk into a certain bar and order a draft beer, you\u2019re more likely in that sweetspot than if you ordered, say, a Coke. A different bar might discover that the customer that orders a top-shelf martini is most likely to lead to the best outcome.\nOver time, you\u2019ll start to develop slight variations on your sweetspot. If one kind of martini is good, then a few are even better. Pancake houses start selling Swedish, German and even Brazilian pancakes. Insurance companies start selling a dozen different variations on whole life.\nClusters work because people are likely to be drawn to a crowd. They also work because making a good, better, best comparison gives us the confidence to go ahead and buy something. It\u2019s not an accident that profitable products like cars come in so many variations\u2013having a choice makes it easier to choose (at least for a while). When Heinz comes in four colors, you don\u2019t have to decide whether or not to buy ketchup\u2026 you merely have to decide which color, and they win every time.\nClusters have a few problems. The first is that you inevitably leave people out. If your restaurant serves nothing but spicy food, then the odd duck who came with a group and doesn\u2019t like spicy food is going to go away unhappy.\nClusters get boring. If all you\u2019ve got is another variation of the same fundraising tool that\u2019s worked so well for you, it\u2019s hard to get a meeting with me (again).\nAnd most of all, clusters make it hard to develop new sweetspots.

Do all of that and of course you'll make more money. Problem solved.\nThe unhappy theory of business ethics is this: you have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize profit. Period. To do anything other than that is to cheat your investors. And in a competitive world, you don't have much wiggle room here.\nIf you would like to believe in business ethics, the unhappy theory is a huge problem.\nAs the world gets more complex, as it's harder to see the long-term given the huge short-term bets that are made, as business gets less transparent (\"which company made that, exactly?\") and as the web of interactions makes it harder for any one person to stand up and take responsibility, the happy theory begins to fall apart. After all, if the long-term effects of a decision today can't possibly have any impact on the profit of this project (which will end in six weeks), then it's difficult to argue that maximizing profit and doing the right thing are aligned. The local store gets very little long-term profit for its good behavior if it goes out of business before the long-term arrives.\nIt comes down to this:only people can have ethics.Ethics, as in, doing the right thing for the community even though it might not benefit you or your company financially.

That\u2019s the juicy part of the business\u2026 finding writers for your readers as much as you spend time finding readers for other people\u2019s writers. A book costs about a dollar or two to print and sells for $20\u2026 Lots of room there for Amazon to integrate the process, to find long tail successes, to match hidden needs with authors needing promotion.\nKindle, the code name for their new ebook reader, gives them a platform where they can actually begin to be a publisher (though for now, they\u2019re resorting to acting like a low-paid middleman, once again leaving short-sighted publishers to cripple a new medium).\nWhen Amazon came to talk to me about being included on the reader a long long time ago, I said sure,but.\nThe but is that I wanted my books to be free and included in every reader, and my blog, too.\nThe beauty of real books is that they don\u2019t require a reader, which means that millions of people are eligible members of the market. Even if you only have .0001% market share, you can still get your book read.\nThe challenge that my hero Jeff Bezos has is that if he\u2019s really really lucky, he\u2019ll sell a million of these things in a year. And that means that at $10 a book, you need to have significant market share to make an impact. The Sony reader has been out for months and it has sold, perhaps, a few thousand units.\nMy thought was to use it, at least for a few years, as a promotion device. Give the books for free to anyone who buys the $400 machine. (Maybe you can have 1,000 books of your choice, so there\u2019s not a lot of \u2018waste\u2019.) You\u2019ll sell more machines that way, that\u2019s for sure. And the people willing to buy the device are exactly the sort of people that an author like me wants to reach. No harm, no foul, all three of us win. If there were a million of these machines out there and an author had a chance to have her next book show up automatically on all of them, few among us would say, \"no thanks to that exposure.\"\nThis is a disruptive approach, the sort of thing only a market leader could pull off. It changes the world in a serious way. I wanted to be part of that.\nI was unpersuasive. Sorry."}]}

I was 23 years old and amazed. What I didn\u2019t realize was that revolutions like this were extremely rare, and here was one, at exactly the right moment for my career and for a new cadre of creators.\nA big shift the Mac announced was turning the computer from a hobbyist novelty into the center of pop culture, productivity and creative work. The Commodore 64 was a toy. This was a car. The first leap like this since Henry Ford.\nThe device itself didn\u2019t do nearly as much as we hoped it would (yet), but the clear and actionable promises that it brought with it changed what we expected and imagined might be next.\nRegis McKennanever got enough credit for being the visionary behind so much of the marketing and the ripples it caused.Susan Karebecame a minor celebrity\u2013for giving a computer a face and a personality.\nIt was the first time the launch of a new product (other than the Edsel, perhaps) was a media event of this magnitude.\nThe Super Bowl ad (which Jobs didn\u2019t even want to do) marked a shift from ads being about the product to also being about the ads.\nOnce we got the joke, we wanted to tell everyone else. Insiders and outsiders. Early adopters and the mainstream. Evangelists. A pattern that\u2019s been repeated hundreds of times since then.\nThere are few concepts that can\u2019t be explained with an Apple anecdote, and it largely began with the launch of this one device.\n[I invented two devices to work with the Mac\u2013the first fax board in 1986, and a precursor to Sonos that would pipe your music across the room.

It started with the most populist, inclusionary point of view of all, but over time, people being people, a hierarchy and inner circle has been created. The exclusion is based on effort and skill, not race or income, but it\u2019s still exclusionary. And at its best, it makes the site work.

The future of marketing (at least the big successes) is going to be fueled by those with the guts to embrace the masses.

Advertisers wanted lots of viewers and viewers wanted shows that lots of them wanted to watch. So the TV networks used ratings as a proxy for advertiser happiness and there wasn't much of a problem.\nThe same thing was true for newspapers. More local readers meant local advertisers were happy.\nBoth newspapers and TV networks suffer when mass starts to disappear. Viewers seek out what they want to watch, as opposed to what the masses want, and advertisers are left to scramble for eyeballs.\nHBO turns this upside down. The viewers ARE the customer. HBO can program with confidence, because there's no question about who they are working for.\nSearch engine advertising works because the search engine knows the searcher is going to leave the site no matter what. They don't care if you leave to click on an organic link or a paid one, as long as you come back often. And the advertiser is paying by the click, so he cares about having the right people click, not everyone. Fairly aligned goals among all three parties.\nWhich leads to the conundrum faced by Twitter as they try to monetize sufficiently to justify the expectations of their investors.\nIf they relentlessly sell the attention of their users, they will have a misalignment as they maximize profit. The advertisers will want ever more attention, and the users will want to avoid those interruptions the advertisers are paying for. Tension will keep rising as users feel trapped by a medium with few substitutes that begins to charge an ever higher tax in the form of attention wasted.\nMy suggestion: Twitter has the opportunity to become extraordinarily aligned with their best users. Offer the top users the opportunity to pay $10 a month. For that fee, they can get an ever-growing list of features, including analytics, verification, 160 characters, who knows\u2026\n10,000,000 users choosing to pay $10 a month means that the service turns a profit (!) of more than a billion dollars a year. And because the company is in alignment with their most powerful and evangelical users, that number grows over time. Every decision proposed will have to answer just one question: what makes our users happier?\nFree is a great idea, until free leads to a conflict between those contributing attention and those contributing cash."}]}

That's what economists call a situation in which someone benefits from the entire community paying for something without contributing themselves. It becomes a problem when others feel like suckers and then similarly drop out.\nCheating on your taxes is a classic example. You get to ride on the roads and benefit from the civilization that others are paying for. One non-participant won't crash the system, but if it spreads\u2026\nNot vaccinating your kids is a similarly selfish act. In an affluent community, a few free-riders probably don't cause much damage because if most kids are vaccinated, the disease won't spread. But, as we've seen in the battle to eradicate polio, when more than a few people don't contribute (in this case, by being vaccinated), we all lose.\nMedia, though, feels different. In Grand Central there are tall metal cages at the exit from each rail car, designed to collect already read newspapers. It's actuallyagainst the lawto remove a paper (if you could, the sides are too high) and read it.\nI'm sure someone at a newspaper fought hard for this, figuring that everyone should buy their very own paper. The thing is, newspapers don't make much profit on the sale of the paper, they make money selling eyeballs to advertisers. If more and more people read each copy of the paper, the audience would go up, ad rates could rise and they'd actually come out ahead in the long run.\nOr consider Wikipedia. Almost everyone who uses Wikipedia (hundreds of millions of people) fails to contribute cash to run it, and they also fail to edit or contribute to the content of the site. At first, this feels wrong. Here's the thing: one more reader costs Wikipedia virtually nothing, and the people who are donating and the people who are editing are doing it precisely because a lot of people read it. If the only people who read it were the people who were contributing, people would stop contributing.\nThis blog is read mostly by people who have not bought my books. That's generally okay with me because I don't write the blog to sell books, but it's also okay because it turns out that the fact that lots of people read the blog makes my ideas and books more attractive to those that do buy them. Readers know that a better understanding of my ideas might just help them be part of a larger conversation, so the investment and time and money seems a lot less risky.\nOr consider the art museum that prohibits photography, ostensibly to keep unpaid guests from seeing what's inside. The thing is, for many people it's more fun to visit a museum filled with famous images, isn't it?\nTake a second to reconsider the funnel mindset. A marketer who thinks about the funnel realizes that she needs 100 people in at the top to get ten in the middle to end up with just one paid customer at the bottom. A leaky funnel is a real problem, because it costs a lot of money to keep putting people in at the top. But what if instead of a funnel, we imagine a two-part market? One part is actively participating, supporting and partaking, all because the second part is busy free riding.\nThere are edge cases everywhere that make the free-rider benefit seem a lot less beneficial. Wholesale piracy, deliberate theft of services\u2013many organizations and business models can't thrive in a world of anonymous taking. On the other hand, once you can get your head (and your heart) around the idea that ideas that spread, win, there are significant opportunities in a digital world where it's easier than ever to help people go for a free ride."}]}

As flattering as it is to believe that a successful organization might actually want my advice about their problems, I\u2019m really hesitant to take this sort of commitment on. Why? Because I figure if I charge someone to solve their problems, I better be confident that I can. And in my experience, a consultant rarely solves your problems\u2014you do. So I\u2019m much happier teaching people to fish.\nThat said, it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s a lot of excitement about the Purple Cow concept and many people want the energy and insight they can get from brainstorming in person. So, here\u2019s the first in what will become a series of semi-public Purple Cow training and brainstorming sessions.\nWHAT YOU GET: 6 hours of intensive brain workout. The first two hours are me, laying the groundwork. The next 4 hours are you (and the other attendees) sharing their specific problems and challenges. As a group, we\u2019ll figure out a thousand PC-approved ways of being remarkable, not invisible.\nTHE GUARANTEE: I\u2019ve run sessions in my office before on other topics, and I can happily tell you that no one has ever taken me up on the following: If you don\u2019t think you got ideas and insights that were worth way more than you paid to come, it\u2019s free. I\u2019ll give you back all your tuition.\nHOW MUCH? $800 per person. Second person in your organization comes for $400, unless it\u2019s your boss\u2014she pays $300.\nLUNCH? On me.\nWHERE? In my funky office at 145 Palisade St, Dobbs Ferry, NY, 12 miles north of New York City. You can get here on the train from Grand Central in about 40 minutes.\nWHEN? Thursday, May 8th. Starts at 10 sharp. Finished by 4, but you can hang for another half hour or so if you want to chat.\nHOW TO SIGN UP? This is a very informal process, because space is so limited. Drop me an email at seth@sethgodin.com. Make sure you put the word YOGURT in the subject line. Why yogurt? Well, it\u2019s milk from a cow, with some culture added, then you shake it up and the thing you end up with is better than what you started with. Sort of."}]}

Your preparation for an upcoming meeting, the voice in your head as you think about your choices, the knowledge that you\u2019re accountable for your actions\u2013all of these end up weaving into the future version of you.\nIt\u2019s entirely possible to coach yourself. To develop internal habits and standards that help you ratchet forward, drip by drip. But when you find yourself alone in a \u201cco\u201d working space, or isolated from good leadership, or wondering about what\u2019s next, it might just be a signal that you\u2019re missing the 10% from the core, the seed that you can build on and then internalize.\nSooner or later, all motivation is self motivation.

The first, which happens to be the most common, is to leave on time, do your best to park nearby, repeatedly glance at your watch, and then start moving faster and faster. By the time you get to security, you realize that you\u2019re quite late, so you cut the line (\"My plane leaves in 10 minutes!\" you shout). You walk fast. As you get closer to your gate, you realize that walking fast isn\u2019t going to work, so you start to jog. Three gates away, you break into a run, and if you\u2019re lucky, you barely make the flight.\nThe second way is to leave for the airport 10 minutes early.\nThe easiest way to deal with change and with all the anxieties that go with it is not to deal with it at all. The easiest thing to do is to allow the urgency of the situation to force us to make the decisions (or take the actions) that we\u2019d rather not take. Why? Because then we don\u2019t have to take responsibility for what happens. The situation is at fault, not us. The beauty of the asymptotic curve is that at every step along the way, running ever faster for the plane is totally justified. The closer we get, the more we\u2019ve invested ourselves. The more we invest in making our flight, the easier it is to justify running like a lunatic to make it.\nYears ago, I published a directory of law firms. No fewer than 70% of the firms sent their payment the night before it was due, by FedEx. Eight of the firms sent their payment by messenger\u2013at an expense that was equal to about 10% of the entire cost of their listing. Obviously, there was no need to waste all that money. Law firms spend millions every year on last-minute deliveries because, like most of us, they confuse urgent with important.\nUrgent issues are easy to address. They are the ones that get everyone in the room for the final go-ahead. They are the ones we need to decide on right now, before it\u2019s too late.\nHow can you tell if you\u2019re too obsessed with urgent?\nDo senior people at your company refuse to involve themselves in decisions until the last minute?\nDo meetings regularly get canceled because something else came up?\nIs waiting until the last minute the easiest way to get a final decision from your peers?\nSmart organizations ignore the urgent. Smart organizations understand that important issues are the ones to deal with. If you focus on the important stuff, the urgent will take care of itself.\nA key corollary to this principle is the idea that if you don\u2019t have the time to do it right, there\u2019s no way in the world you\u2019ll find the time to do it over. Too often, we use the urgent as an excuse for shoddy work or sloppy decision-making. A quick look at Washington politics (under any administration) is an easy way to understand how common this crutch is. No responsible business (or diligent family) would spend money and resources the way our government does when faced with an \"emergency.\" Urgent is not an excuse. In fact, urgent is often an indictment\u2013a sure sign that you\u2019ve been putting off the important stuff until it mushrooms out of control.\nThe most important idea of all is this one: You will succeed in the face of change when you make the difficult decisions first. It\u2019s easy to justify running for your plane when it\u2019s leaving in two minutes and you\u2019re only five gates away. It\u2019s much harder to justify waking up 10 minutes early to avoid the problem altogether. Alas, waking up early is the efficient, effective way to deal with the challenge. Waking up earlier may seem foolish to the person lying in bed next to you, but when you enjoy the benefits of a pleasant stroll to the gate, you realize that your difficult decision was a good one.\nOrganizations manage to justify draconian measures\u2013laying people off, declaring bankruptcy, stiffing their suppliers, and closing stores\u2013by pointing out the urgency of the situation. They refuse to make the difficult decisions when the difficult decisions are cheap. They don\u2019t want to expend the effort to respond to their competition or fire the intransigent VP of development. Instead, they focus on the events that are urgent at that moment and let the important stuff slide.\nA quick look at the gradually failing airlines, retailers, and restaurant chains we all know about confirms this analysis. They\u2019re all content to worry about today\u2019s emergency, setting the stage for tomorrow\u2019s disaster. Better, I think, to wake up 10 minutes early, make some difficult decisions before breakfast, and enjoy the rest of your day.\n(Thanks to Rick Terrien for pointing me to this article. I wrote it more than a year ago in Fast Company, then things got urgent\u2026)"}]}

It\u2019s choice that drives suppliers to do better work, because they know you can pick a competitor. Choice moves power from the supplier to the customer.\nSoftware works as a business. The cost of supporting one more user is very low, and the network effect is a miracle.\nAny time someone builds software that works better when others are using it too, the network effect has a chance to kick in. Word dominated because you were better off using the same word processor as your peers, so you could exchange files.\nOnline, the network effect allows some companies to clear the table, signing up hundreds of millions of users, creating software dynasties.\nAnd then, almost always, the software gets lousy.\nBecause we don\u2019t have a choice (for now).\nPaypal has a notoriously slow and weak search capability. Facebook used its hegemony to get careless about their UI and sloppy about public policy issues. Apple\u2019s software rarely gets significantly improved\u2026\nBecause we don\u2019t have a choice (for now).\nIt\u2019s surprising to me that capitalism\u2019s most outspoken supporters aren\u2019t clear about the difference between companies that exist in competitive markets, and those that have achieved lock in. The lock in that comes with the network effect almost ensures that the company will cease to innovate or optimize on the part of the customer. They\u2019re paying attention to costs and profits, not long-term impact or customer satisfaction.\nIf you believe in free markets, then net neutrality and portability are essential building blocks for the future.\nAs more and more of our life involves networks (and their effects) a bias toward owning data and having other options in software is the best way we have to make sure we have a say on how we engage with the network.\n[Morehere]."}]}

What is it?\nWell, if you\u2019re disheartened by my previous post about licensing your idea, here\u2019s the punchline: Real business creativity comes from boundaries.\nInventing something cool that can\u2019t be implemented isn\u2019t creative. It\u2019s mostly a waste.\nI think that inventing the unimplementable is a fine hobby, but it\u2019s also a bit of a crutch. Yes, of course we need big visions and big ideas, but not at the expense of the stuff you can actually pull off.\nSo, let\u2019s get specific:\nIf you\u2019ve decided you want to create a breakthrough in your area of expertise (say Ajax coding), then either be prepared to launch and run it when you\u2019re done, or have a clear licensing strategy in mind, one where you\u2019re not the first person in history to pull it off.\nIf you\u2019ve decided to invent a great idea for a book, better be ready to write it too, and either find a publisher or publish it yourself. There\u2019s no market for book ideas.\nIf you want to do creative ads, it helps to have clients willing to run them.\nThese constraints are the best part of being creative, as far as I\u2019m concerned. I couldn\u2019t imagine writing Superman comics. The rules are too vague. There are too many choices. In non-profits and organizations and even in politics, the rules are pretty obvious (sometimes they\u2019re too obvious). So the real creativity comes in navigating those rules in a way that creates a breakthrough.\nOne of my favorite triumphs of all time happened on my first day of work at my first real job, 1984, Cambridge, MA. No voice mail in those days. I was employee #30. I walked in and there was a plastic carousel, about 18 inches in diameter, with 40 slots in it. Like thin slices of pizza, but 4 inches deep. Each slot had a sticker with a name typed on it. Not in any order, particularly.\nEvery day, when you went into work, you had to spin the carousel around and around until you saw your name, and then grab whatever pink slips had your phone messages on them.\nNow, there are 100 better ways to do this system. Faster and easier. But 99 of them required getting a new carousel or device.\nInstead, I grabbed a paper clip and put it on my slot. I could find my slot in a heartbeat now.\nWithin a day, the carousel was covered with flags and widgets and more. Problem solved.\nSee the rules. Keepmostof them. Break one or two. But break them, don\u2019t bend them. (thanks toCurtfor various inspirations)."}]}

They are risking the trust and attention of the audience by choosing THIS instead of THAT. If they develop a reputation for having good taste (in however the audience defines that) they earn more attention and trust and the benefit of the doubt.\nThe great publishers might not be famous (Motown was, andThe New Yorkeris) but they change the culture.\nTED takes a risk when they put someone on the main stage or feature a video online. And a podcaster takes a risk when they choose a guest.\nThe artist gets two benefits. They get the benefit of being picked: cash, editing, the emotional solace of being selected and supported.\nAnd they get the benefit of curation. They reach a scarce audience with help from an organization that\u2019s good at that, and is willing to risk theirpermissionasset to support the artist\u2019s work.\nThe internet has pockets where all of this is intentionally undermined, often by organizations that adopt the mantle of publisher when it\u2019s convenient.\nThe Long Tailis Chris Anderson\u2019s term for a library with infinite shelf space, one where the rules of scarcity don\u2019t apply in the same way. The internet platform doesn\u2019t care how many different titles they carry, and in fact, benefits from carrying all of them. Spotify and YouTube and Amazon don\u2019t actually care what you listen to or watch, as long as you come back tomorrow.\nBecause they have nothing much at stake when it comes to content, and because they are focused on scale, they defer to an algorithm. It\u2019s the mysterious program, by now so complex that no one knows exactly how it works, that decides what works get attention. Even the people who work there guess at what the algorithm wants.\nAnd this has consequences.\nLook up a recipe online. It\u2019s a very different experience than finding a recipe in your favorite cookbook. The recipes online offer nearly infinite variety, but they\u2019re largely untested, and they\u2019re formatted in a time-wasting upside-down sort of way because someone decoded that this is what Google\u2019s algorithm would like.\nLook at most of the junk in the app store, or most of the content in social media. The algorithm sorts through everything, and when anything can make a buck, anything will.\nOf course, there are enormous benefits to the long tail. It gives creators who don\u2019t match an existing editorial paradigm a chance to be heard. It gives readers/listeners/watchers a chance to discover things that would have been unpublished in the old model. And it creates room for discussion and access where it might not have existed.\nBut\u2026\nPublishing to an algorithm is not the same as publishing to an audience. If the creator has no publisher and no permission asset, then being heard is dramatically more difficult. As is getting paid.\nAnd living in a culture that\u2019s driven by profit-seeking algorithm owners is different as well. Because without curation, who is responsible? Who is guiding the culture? Who pushes the boundaries or raises the standards?\nWikipedia has 5,000 curators who work overtime to keep the site from becoming yet another example of Godwin\u2019s Law. Sites that only obey the Long Tail and the primacy of the algorithm have fewer standards. They view curation as a last resort, and if mass is the standard, then mass is all that will be rewarded.\nIt\u2019s tempting to hope that there\u2019s a hybrid out there. But for that to exist, the algorithms have to work for creators and publishers, not the other way around. The publishers have to embrace the cost of curation, focusing on what they want to promote and paying the price to do so, owning the upside and downside of that intervention.\nCulture is almost always improved not by what the masses want tomorrow, but by what a small and dedicated group of people are willing to commit to for the long run. \u201cPeople like us do things like this\u201d is the recipe for culture.\nCreators: It\u2019s possible (perhaps required) to not wait to get picked by a traditional publisher. At the same time, we benefit when we realize that the algorithm isn\u2019t rooting for us and quite probably is working against us. The only winning approach is to earn permission and a direct connection with our fans and then act as curators for ideas (and as our own publishers).\nPlatforms: It helps to acknowledge that you\u2019re not actually a publisher, that ceding decisions to the crowd and the algorithm and walking away from curation might make you a landlord, but you\u2019re not incrementally improving the culture. Yes, it\u2019s possible to find a middle ground, as Netflix has, but it requires awareness, persistence and discipline.\nYou probably won\u2019t find this post by searching for it on Google, because they moved my blog down in the results a really long time ago.

It\u2019s gratifying and humbling, and a testament to what one person with dedication can do now that we all have access to the network. You can find organizer pages forSalt Lake,Phoenix,Ann ArborandSilicon Valleyfor more details on how they did it.\nThis is a much bigger story than one author visiting a few cities. This sort of approach works for just about any marketer. If you don\u2019t have customers who are willing to organize this sort of event, what are you missing? It\u2019s easy to imagine doctors doing it when bringing a brain researcher to town. Or chocolate or wine fanatics welcoming a particularly talented vintner to their neighborhood.

They hate the idea of going to a city on spec, hoping the bookstore can scare enough people into coming by (usually by posting signs in the lobby) and most of all they hate the idea of a slightly indifferent audience walking by, sniffing at a book and walking away. Ouch. And it\u2019s not just authors that hate it. Willy Loman hated it, too. So does John McCain.\nThe takeaway for all of us is this:1. Build a permission asset: a group of people that actually wants to hear what you\u2019re up to.2. Create something (a product, a service, a story) that those people want to spread (not get paid to spread, but choose to spread) and get out of the way.\nThanks to the organizers around the country, we all just learned something."}]}

Without friction, without responsibility (it\u2019s anonymous) and with the cost absorbed by the ISP and the recipient, bad actors cause a problem.3. also a problem: even permission email gets used up when senders take short term gains because it\u2019s free.

But you don\u2019t want to hassle with RSS. No problem. Those organizations will pony up a quarter of a cent and that email ends up in your inbox. With a special flag indicating that the (non-anonymous) sender indicated you had signed up for it.\nIf you didn\u2019t sign up for it, let us know. If more than a tiny number of people call it spam, then that sender is busted. They forfeit a bond and we blacklist them. Just because they paid doesn\u2019t mean they can spam.\nc. the old rules of email remain. BUT, if you get an email from someone who is not on your address list OR they\u2019re not paying a quarter of a cent, we assume that this is mail you don\u2019t really want and we put it in your suspect folder.

This extraction mindset occurs in environments\u00a0where profits are taken from a captive resource. It doesn't matter if it's coal, tickets or tuition, the mindset is the same.\nIt's not about oil, it's about the expectation.\nThey're not making any more oil, of course, and the race is on to get it all.Get it now, or someone else will take it.Take it all, because there's no reason to leave it there. Make sure others don't take it, because what they take isn't something you can take. And when the reserve is exhausted, move on. To the next field, to the next market.\nNot everyone in any given community has an extraction mindset, but the worldview is: Anything that slows down, impedes or interferes with more extraction is nothing but a challenge to be overcome.\nDebt amplifies this urgency. And so some industrial farmers race to digdeeper wellsto take the last remaining water because if they don't, the mortgage due on their farm might wipe them out. And so public companies race to maximize their short-term profits (and CEO bonuses), even if it comes at the cost of the long term.\nThirty years ago, I asked the fabled rock promoter Bill Graham a question that I thought was brilliant, but he pwned me in his response. \"Bill, given how fast a Bruce Springsteen concert sells out, why don't you charge $100 a seat and keep all the upside?\" (In those days, $100 was considered a ridiculous sum for a concert ticket).\n\"Well, I could do that, but the thing is, I'm here all year round, and my kids only have a limited budget to spend on concerts. If I charged that much for one concert, they wouldn't be able to come to the other shows I book\u2026\"\nBill wasn't just spreading the money out over time. He was investing in a community that could develop a habit of music going, a community that would define itself around what he was building.\nJoel Salatinis a farmer, but he doesn't seek to extract first, instead, he's building a network, creating a long-term, sustainable culture that feeds itself as it benefits him.\nIn the words ofKevin Kelly:Feed the network first.\nThe network, of course, doesn't always want to do what you want it to do, as fast as you want it to happen.\nThis chasm between the mindset ofextractingand the alternative offeedingbecomes more urgent as networks (online ones, environmental ones, tribal ones) become ever more powerful.\nThe chasm is so deep, people on each side of it have trouble imagining what the other side is thinking. Some people show up in your email box or social network intent on taking what they can get (can I have a guest post? wanna fund my project? made you look\u2026) while others are patiently weaving together a cohort of meaning.\nIt's expensive and time-consuming to choose a path that doesn't deliver maximum value today.Unlessyou do the math on what happens tomorrow. Tomorrow, the network is either more productive or less. Tomorrow, the network is either trusting or suspicious. Tomorrow, the network is either healthier or sick.\nThe promise of our connected economy was that it would reward the good guys, the long-term players, the people who cared enough to contribute. The paradox is that this very same economy has become filled with people who are easily distracted, addicted to shiny objects and too often swayed by the short-term sensation or by short-term profit.\nThe extraction mindset leads to intelligent short-term decisions. If it costs too much to exploit a resource, move on. The network mindset values the long-term impacts of co-creation.\nThe network (that would be us) then needs to decide if it will continue to reward short-term thinking in order to enhance extraction, or if we care enough about the long-term that we'll act up in favor of sustainability, raising the costs of short-term (selfish) action so it becomes ever more profitable to focus on the long-term instead."}]}

The cost to the sender of a card is essentially zero. The cost to the recipient, however, is significant.

Build a reputation as someone who creates great ideas, sometimes on demand. Or as someone who can manipulate or build on your ideas better than a copycat can. Or use your ideas to earn a permission asset so you can build a relationship with people who are interested. Focus on being the best tailor with the sharpest scissors, not the litigant who sues any tailor who deigns to use a pair of scissors."}]}

If we choose, it can become the cornerstone of our work.\nSome of us make a thing and many of us make a system. What makes something practically elegant is that it\u2019s better, smoother, cleaner, more understandable, kinder, more efficient, friendlier or more approachable than it needs to be.\nMicrosoft Windows was never particularly elegant, as you could see the nuts and bolts underneath it. It was clunky, but it got the job done.\nOn the other hand, the Macintosh-for at least 20 years-was surprisingly elegant. When it broke, it broke in an elegant way. It knew things before it asked us to type them in, it had a smile on its face\u2013it seemed to have a sense of humor.\nWhen we create something with practical elegance, we are investing time and energy in a user experience that satisfies the user more than it helps the bottom line of the company that made it. Ironically, in the long run, satisfying the user is the single best way to help the bottom line of a company that doesn\u2019t have monopoly power.\nWhen a designer combines functionality with delight, we\u2019re drawn to whatever she\u2019s produced. That\u2019s the elegance we\u2019re searching for in our built world.\nAn enemy of practical elegance is persistent complexity, often caused by competing demands, network effects and the status quo. The latest operating system of the Mac is without elegance. When it crashes, and mine has been every few hours for the last week, it crashes poorly. The kernel panic reports are unreadable, by me and by their support folks. The dialogue boxes aren\u2019t consistent, the information flow is uneven and nothing about the experience shows any commitment to polish, to delight or to the user.\nPractical elegance doesn\u2019t mean that the canoe will never capsize. It means that the thing we built was worth building, and it left the user feeling better, not worse, about their choice.\nToo often, \u201ccustomer service\u201d has come to mean \u201canswer the phone and give a refund.\u201d But customer service begins long before something breaks. It\u2019s about a commitment to the experience. Creating delight before it\u2019s expected. Building empathy and insight into the interactions that people will choose to have with you.\nOf course this takes effort. So do all the other things that go into a product or service. Apparently, though, this effort is perceived as optional by some.\nAs soon as a product or system creator starts acting like the user has no choice, elegance begins to disappear."}]}

First, it helps your staff, your designers, your marketers and your sales force get on the same page about what they're building and growing. And second, it might be unrealistic. You might be hoping for a market that's far bigger than it is, or to solve a problem that's too easy (or too difficult).\nWhen Apple designs a hardware device or a singer records an album, the question must be asked, \"What's this for?\" Sure, people can run an accounting business with an iPad, or play one particular song on the album at a party, but is that what it's for?\nMany organizations will take any customer, any time, and bend and writhe to accomodate money in whatever form it arrives.

The internal response (or reaction) to these ventures is a cultural choice, one that often turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nIf your organization is both pessimistic and operationally focused, then every new idea is a threat. It represents more work, something that could go wrong, a chance for disaster. People work to protect against the downside, to insulate against the market, to be sure that they won't get blamed for anything that challenges the system. In organizations like this, a new idea has to be proven to be better than the current status quoin all situationsbefore it gets launched.\nOn the other hand, an organization filled with people who are rewarded for shaking things up and generating game-changing products and services just might discover that outcomes they are dreaming of are in fact what happen. The enthusiasm that comes from believing that this one might just resonate with the market is precisely the ingredient that's required to make something resonate.\nOne more thing: outsiders are way more likely to approach your organization with fabulous projects if they think they're likely to both get a good reception and succeed when they get to market."}]}

It was a high-spirited outing, with terrific performances and it was a great way for them to spend a month or two over the summer. I was amazed to discover, though, that the budget for the rights to the play were $3,000. That's pretty steep for a high school production of an old, not particularly wonderful musical script that was only going to be seen by the local community. Should it really cost $7 for every person who watches the play?\nThe reason fees for licensing plays are so high is that almost all plays and musicals are licensed by just a few firms and the purchasers have no power whatsoever. The sellers have signalled each other and created an artificially high pricing floor. \"Take it or leave it\" is their motto.\nHere's the opportunity that the net provides (in this case and so many others): someone should organize thecustomersand negotiate on their behalf.\nImagine contacting 3,000 high schools and finding 500 willing to join together and agree to act as a buying cartel. Now, the organizer can poll the directors at these schools and find thirty plays they'd be willing to put on next year. Go to the rights holders of these plays and say, \"We're going to pick six of these plays. Each of the six will get a huge number of customers as a result, perhaps twenty times as many as you usually get. But to be among the six, you need to lower your price by a factor of ten.\"\nNow, if you're the rights holder, you have a dilemma (but not a huge one). You can agree to lower your price and thus double your annual revenue on this dusty old play, or you can stay where you are and make zero.\nHmmmm.\nOver time, the cartel will only grow more powerful. Word of mouth will spread, because news that joining this cartel cuts the cost of renting a play or musical by 90% is noteworthy. More will join. The benefits to the rights holders who agree to play along will go up because they'll have the play reach more audiences. The only losers will be those that are stuck on the old model of taking advantage of independent communities with no purchasing power.\nWhile this has been tried in markets where it's very difficult to make it work (like consumer electronics where the margins are small) I think it can thrive in business to business, service and intellectual property markets where market share can easily make up for lowered profits. Universities can join up to push down the price of textbooks by agreeing to adopt the one of the six acceptable ones that's the cheapest\u2013and all the others get zero. The key is frequent communication and solidarity as you go through the dip that will happen when providers resist your initial offers. That's why the net (and free online coordination and messaging) are so critical.\nThink of all the tiny vertical markets where this can really pay off.\nAnd of course, the organizer deserves (and gets) a piece of the savings."}]}

The important thing to remember about these seven things is that you can plan for them. You can know before you start whether or not you have the resources and the will to get to the end. Most of the time, if you fail to become the best in the world, it\u2019s either because you planned wrong or because you gave up before you reached your goal.\nEven worse than quitting in the first six cases: not quitting. Settling. Sticking with it but not succeeding.\nIs it possible that you\u2019re just not good enough? That you (or your team) just don\u2019t have enough talent to be the best in the world? Sure, it\u2019s possible. In fact, if your chosen area is the cello, or speed skating, then I might even say it\u2019s probable. But in just about every relevant area I can think of, no, it\u2019s not likely. Youaregood enough. The question is, will you take the shortcut you need to get really good at this?"}]}

Not everywhere, not all the time, but widely.\nNot simply the royalty of nations, but of organizations as well.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that in addition to monarchs, there are monarchists, citizens and employees and followers who prefer the certainty that comes from someone else.\nRoyalty offers something to some of those who are ruled. If it didn\u2019t, it wouldn\u2019t exist.\nAs Sahlins and Graeber outline in their extraordinary (and dense) book onKings, there\u2019s often a pattern in the nature of monarchs. Royalty doesn\u2019t have to play by the same cultural rules, and often \u2018comes from away.\u2019 Having someone from a different place and background allows the population to let themselves off the hook when it comes to creating the future.\nIf your participation in leadership is not required, then you\u2019re free to simply be a spectator.\nWhen we industrialized the world over the last century, we defaulted to this structure. Many Western industrial organizations began as founder-celebrated and founder-driven. CEOs could, apparently, do no wrong. Until the world their business operated in changed.\nIn large corporations, the autocratic, well-paid chieftain has the trappings of a monarch. A private air force, minions and the automatic benefit of the doubt. Working in this setting requires obedience and effort from employees more than agency or independence.\nA well-functioning constitutional monarchy is surprisingly effective. That\u2019s not the problem. The problem is what happens when it stops to function well. The problem can happen when royalty becomes selfish, shortsighted or impatient. Or the problem could be a pattern of employees or members or citizens failing to participate. Resilience disappears and the system becomes brittle.\nWhen the world changes, and it does, faster than ever, it\u2019s community and connection that moves us forward.\nModern organizations are discovering that all of us know more than any of us, and that engaged individuals ready to not only speak up but to eagerly take responsibility for the work they do is an effective, resilient and equitable way to show up in the world."}]}

There was actually a difference between professional and amateur typesetting. There was style and craft and insight that was worth paying for. There were magazines and conferences about what looked good and right and professional and cutting edge.\nOf course, social media changed that. Memes and the rest, built on a flimsy foundation of Comic Sans and Arial and Impact. Whatever\u2019s handy.

You can't. The smart marketer will measure how much direct response it's costing to be beautiful, or how much storytelling is being sacrificed to be clicked on. Not both.\n[A few readers asked me to expand on this idea: It turns out that in most encounters, the worldview of people who are likely to sign up, 'like', share, click, act and generally take action instantly is not the same worldview of people that convert into long-term, loyal customers over time. Take a look at the coupons in the Sunday paper, or the direct mail pieces that show up in your mailbox, or the websites that are optimized for click/here/now.\nUnattractive high-response sites aren't usually the result of a lack of taste or talent on the part of the designer, they're optimized for one worldview.\nThe design that you and I might see as non-beautiful is in fact a signal to one group of people just as much as it is a turn off to the other group.

It's pretty clear to most of us that if that very same bundle of molecules wafted in the door when the clever and happy grandson came to visit, there would be no problem.\nOf course the nocebo is real.

We did the cuts today.\u201d\n\u201cWe did play auditions all day yesterday, and so many people turned out, there just wasn\u2019t a role for you. We picked people who were more talented.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re on the bench until your skills improve. We want to win.\u201d\nAsk the well-meaning coaches and teachers running the tryouts and choosing who gets to play, ask them who gets on stage and who gets fast tracked, and they\u2019ll explain that life is a meritocracy, and it\u2019s essential to teach kids that they\u2019re about to enter a world where people get picked based on performance.\nOr, they might point out that their job is to win, to put on a great show, to entertain the parents with the best performance they can create.\nThis, all of this, is sort of dangerous, unhelpful and nonsensical.\nAs millions head back for another year of school, I\u2019m hoping that parents (and students) can call this out.\nWhen you\u2019re six years old and you try out for the hockey team, only two things are going to get you picked ahead of the others: either you\u2019re older (it\u2019s true,check this out) or you were born with size or speed or some other advantage that wasn\u2019t your choice.\nAnd the junior high musical? It\u2019s pretty clear that kids are chosen based on appearance or natural singing talent, two things that weren\u2019t up to them.\nSoccer and football exist in school not because there\u2019s a trophy shortage, not because the school benefits from winning. They exist, I think, to create a learning experience. But when we bench people because they\u2019re not naturally good, what\u2019s the lesson?\nIf you get ahead for years and years because you got dealt good cards, it\u2019s not particularly likely that you will learn that in the real world, achievement is based as much on attitude and effort as it is on natural advantages. In the real world, Nobel prizes and Broadway roles and the senior VP job go to people who have figured out how to care, how to show up, how to be open to new experiences. Our culture is built around connection and charisma and learning and the ability to not quit in precisely the right moments.\nBut that\u2019s not easy to sort for in school, so we take a shortcut and resort to trivial measures instead.\nWhat if we celebrated the students who regularly try the hardest, help each other the most and lead? What if we fast tracked those students, and made it clear to anyone else willing to adopt those attitudes that they could be celebrated too?\nWhat if you got cast, tracked or made the cut because you were resilient, hard-working and willing to set yourself up for a cycle of continuous improvement? Isn\u2019t that more important than rewarding the kid who never passes but still scores a lot of goals?\nBefore you feature a trumpet prodigy at the jazz band concert, perhaps you could feature the kid who just won\u2019t quit. No need to tell him he\u2019s a great trumpet player\u2013the fact is, none of these kids are Maynard Ferguson\u2013just tell him the truth. Tell him that every single person who has made a career of playing the trumpet (every single one of them) did it with effort and passion, not with lips that naturally vibrate.\nWe\u2019re not spending nearly enough time asking each other:What is School For?\n[update: Now onMedium]\nAnd now inVietnamese.\nAnd now inArabic.\nSince I first publishedStop Stealing Dreamsto the web, it\u2019s been shared millions of times.

For every bully, there are a dozen or a hundred workers/kids/individuals that would prefer not to be bullied. Given these overwhelming odds, how do bullies continue to get away with it?\nBullying is what happens when an individual with power exercises that power against people who don't fit in. By threatening to expose or harm or degrade the outlier, the bully reinforces the status quo in a way that increases his power. [Physical bullying is a different phenomenon\u2026 I'm mostly writing here about emotional bullying.]\n\"I will punish you because you don't fit in, and I will continue to punish you until you do.\"\nBullying persists when bureaucracies and hierarchies permit it to continue.It's easier to keep order in an environment where bullying can thrive (and vice versa), because the very things that permit a few to control the rest also permit bullies to do their work. The bully uses the organization's desire for conformity to his own ends.\nAt the fabulouslab schoolin Manhattan, they're making huge progress at undoing this problem. A recent assembly (organized and run by students and volunteers) was created around weirdness, fear and most of all, \"owning it.\" (The adults in these videos were only 10% as honest and risk-taking as the kids that stood up on stage. The kids talked about physical and mental disabilities, lifestyle choices and the things that made them sing).\nWhen students are given permission to be their best selves, they take it, just as you and I would like to. Because, it's true,we are all weird.When there isn't a race to fit in the most, bullying those that don't fit in loses much of its power.\nThis is incredibly brave and risky for those in charge. It involves trusting people to become something wonderful, as opposed to insisting that they fit in at all costs.\nWe're all a lot weirder than we'd like the world to know. Given the chance, we can share that weirdness and run with it. It's our best shot at a world with art, and a world without bullies. (Morehere, but even better, go do this in your organization\u2026)\n\n"}]}

It's important to understand that the instructions work on all similar problems, not just one.\nHere's an algorithm for sorting any set of numbers, to get them into order. Start with 4,3,5,6,2 for example.\nThebubble sortalgorithm is simple. Compare two numbers. If the first number is higher than the second, switch them. So now it's 3,4,5,6,2. Next step is to compare positions two and three. If the second is higher than the third (it's not) switch them. Repeat for the whole string. Then start over. Do it over and over again until you can go the whole way with no switching. Done.\nSame trick works for alphabetizing words or sorting kids in order by height.\nOf course, there are algorithms that are far more complex, far more intuitive or far more useful.\nAlgorithms don't care a bit if you believe in them or not. They either work or they don't.\nAlgorithms in business appear to be magical, because they allow you to be smart about problems you haven't seen before. The 'angry customer' algorithm or the 'promote a book' algorithm don't always work, but they are approaches that work on a huge range of problems.\nAll of which is a long way to wish Charles Darwin a happy birthday. The simple algorithm he described is often misunderstood but is robust and flexible and powerful, and it works for ideas and businesses as well as fruit flies and turtles.\nIdeas that spread, win. Sometimes ideas get changed in transmission, and sometimes those changed ideas spread even farther and with more impact than the ideas that came before them.\nIn business, if you lock down ideas, make them difficult to change and spread and have impact, you fail. If you accept the fact that change is real, that there is competition for your ideas and that amplifying the good stuff works, you can grow and thrive.\nSeeing the algorithm in action (which the Net makes easy) helps you understand the notion of failing fast, of exposing ideas to the real world with a posture of perpetual beta. The clothing store Zara doesn't have clothes for a particular season, they launch clothes for a particular fortnight. They watch and measure and adjust and then repeat.\nYour organization (and your career) eitherembraceschange and turmoil and sudden shifts in the rules or youfearit. In times of rapid change (that would be now), embracing the algorithm of the evolution of ideas and systems is a significant competitive advantage."}]}

Because he cared. He cared deeply about what he was making and how it would be used. Of course, he didn't just care in a general, amorphous, whiny way, he cared and then actually delivered.\nPoliticians are held in astonishingly low esteem. Congress in particular is setting record lows, but it's an endemic problem. The reason? They consistently act as if they don't care. They don't care about their peers, certainly, and by their actions, apparently, they don't care about us. Money first.\nMany salespeople face a similar problem\u2013perhaps because for years they've used a shallow version of caring as a marketing technique to boost their commissions. One report by the National Association of Realtors found that more than 90% of all homeowners are never again contacted by their real estate agent after the contracts for the home are signed. Why bother\u2026 there's no money in it, just the possibility of complaints. Well, the reason is obvious\u2013you'd come by with cookies and intros to the neighbors if you cared.\nEconomists tell us that the reason to care is that it increases customer retention, profitability and brand value. For me, though, that's beside the point (and even counter to the real goal). Caring gives you a compass, a direction to head and most of all, a reason to do the work you do in the first place.\nCare More.\nIt's only two words, but it's hard to think of a better mantra for the organization that is smart enough to understand the core underpinning of their business, as well as one in search of a reason for being.

No, the reason coachability is so crucial is that without it, you don\u2019t have the emotional maturity to consider whether the advice is good or not.

The new machine will pay for itself in just a few weeks\u2026 but if you switch to the new machine, you lose every penny of the deposit you put down. What should you do?\nIt's pretty clear that defending the money you already spent is going to cost you a fortune. Ignore the deposit, make a new decision.\nWhich makes perfect sense until it gets personal. And the work we do, the art we make, it's personal.\nYou produce a movie. The final scene is your favorite, the hardest to write, the one that you sweated to create and film. But in all the screenings you've done, the audience hates this scene, and when you show the movie without the scene in place, the buzz is fabulous.\nNow, you're not just walking away from a deposit or some training\u2013you're walking away from your best work, from your dreams, from you.\nPart of what it means to be a creative artist is to dive willingly into work that might not work. And the other part, the part that's just as important, is to openly admit when you've gone the wrong direction, andeagerlywalk away, even (especially) when it's personal.\nYes, we have to have faith in our ability.

Some farmers will wait years, or a generation, to try the same thing. Some people start the video going viral, some are the very last to see it.\nWhat distinguishes these people? It's worth noting that someone who might be an innovator at work might choose to be a laggard at home.\nIt turns out that the key is in the way they present themselves with problems. \"I have a problem: I don't have the new cell phone,\" is a concern of the Innovator. On the other hand, the Early Majority says, \"I have a problem, all my friends have a new cell phone and I don't.\"\nNote that few say, \"The device I have doesn't have the right features.\" That's because features don't create problems that we can solve by embracing a new idea or technology.

Instead of comparing what you invest to the benefit you receive from the first bill, the first visit, the first transaction, it's important to not only recognize but embrace the true lifetime value of one more customer.\nWrite it down. Post it on the wall. What would happen if you spent 100% of that amount on each of your next ten new customers? That's more money than you have to spend right now, I know that, but what would happen?

All they did was act within the system that they\u2019ve built for themselves. When companies race offshore to pay ever less in taxes, no one coordinated that.

Not someone with all the answers, because no one has all the answers. No, we want someone who ismagic about to happen.\nThis is the electricity that follows the star quarterback around.

She doesn't need to spin because the truth as she knows it is sufficient.\nThere might only be two critical elements in the choice to be formidable:\n1.Skill. The skill to understand the domain, to do the work, to communicate, to lead, to master all of the details necessary to make your promise come true. All of which is difficult, but insufficient, because none of it matters if you don't have\u2026\n2.Care. The passion to see it through. The willingness to find a different route when the first one doesn't work. The certainty that in fact, there is a way, and you care enough to find it. Amazingly, this is a choice, not something you need to get certified in.\nFormidable leaders find the tough questions, and then, instead of being afraid to ask them, eagerly decide to seek out the answers. They dig in deep to the details that matter and ignore the ones that merely distract. They bite off more than others can chew but consistently avoid biting off more than they can (because they care so much, it hurts to admit that you've reached the end).\nIt's not a dream if you can do it.\nPaul Grahamgets full credit for coining the term. \"A formidable person is one who seems like they'll get what they want, regardless of whatever obstacles are in the way.\" A must-read for startup CEOs."}]}

The job of marketing in this circle is to take what the factory/system/boss gives you and hype it, promote it and yell about it. This is what so many charities, politicians, insurance companies, financial advisors, computer makers and well, just about everyone does.\nThe next circle in has so much more leverage. This is the circle of telling a story that resonates with a tribe. This is the act of creating alignment, of understanding worldviews, of embracing and elevating the weird. Smart marketers in this circle acknowledge that their product or service isn\u2019t for everyone, but bend over backwards to be sure that some people will be able to fall in love with it.\nThe next circle in is easily overlooked. This is the act of changing what surrounds the actual product or service, adding enough usability and support and atmosphere that the perception of the product itself changes. Zappos did this for shoes. Ikea almost willfully goes in the other direction with its furniture assembly and delivery approach. When you go to an expensive restaurant, you\u2019re buying far more than what the chef cooked. Products and services are only commodities if you treat them that way.\nAnd the innermost circle is the product or service itself. When the thing you sell has communication built in, when it is remarkable and worth talking about, when it changes the game\u2013marketing seems a lot easier. Of course, that\u2019s because you did the marketing when you invented the thing, saving you the expense and trouble of yelling about it.\nWhen in doubt, when your marketing isn\u2019t working, the answer is easy: go one circle in.\nJeffsent over this much slicker PDF version:Download Circles of Mktg"}]}

Perhaps you need to close a local store so you can afford to open a better one a few miles away. Or reroute a bus line to serve more customers, while inconveniencing a few. Or maybe you want to replace a perfectly good free mapping application with a new, defective one so you can score points against your hometown rival in your bid for mobile domination.\nA few things to keep in mind:\n1. When possible, don\u2019t downgrade. People are way more focused on what you take away than what you give them. Many times, particularly with software, it\u2019s pretty easy to support old (apparently useless) features that a few rabid (equals profitable, loyal and loud) customers really depend on.\n2. When it\u2019s not possible to avoid a downgrade, provide a bridge or alternatives, and mark them clearly and discount them heavily. In the case of Apple maps on the new iphone, it would have been really easy to include links or even pre-installed apps for other mapping software. It\u2019s sort of silly to make the Lightning adapter a profit center. When you cancel the all you can eat buffet, be generous with the gift cards given to your best customers.\n3. If you can\u2019t build a bridge, own up. Make it clear, andapologize. Not after an outcry, but before it even happens. The genius Francois at the Grand Central Apple store insisted that my hassles with the Music Match feature in iTunes were merely my \"opinion,\" and all the steps I had to go through to move the audio books I\u2019m reviewing from one device to another were in fact good things. It's silly to expect your customers to care about your corporate priorities or to enjoy your corporate-speak. If you've taken something away from them, point it out, admit it and try to earn a chance to delight them again tomorrow.\nApologizing to your best users is significantly more productive than blaming them for liking what you used to do."}]}

And manufacturers were always on the lookout to add a feature that consumers valued more than the marginal cost of adding that feature.\nIn the digital age, all of this thinking goes out the window.\nHow much does it cost a car company to display the temperature outside? Well, it used to mean wiring a circuit, adding a sensor, creating a display. Now, it might cost them $1 (if that) to add that feature to a $40,000 car.\nEven more radically, the marginal cost of just about every feature on a website or an app is precisely zero.

Millions of people read this 690-page political novel. In 2016, the big sellers were coloring books.\nFifteen\u00a0years ago, cable channels like TLC (the \u201cL\u201d stood\u00a0for Learning), Bravo and the History Channel (the \u201cHistory\u201d stood for History) promised to add texture and information to the blighted TV landscape. Now these networks\u00a0run shows about marrying people based on how well they kiss.\nAnd of course, newspapers won Pulitzer prizes for telling us things we didn\u2019t want to hear. We\u2019ve responded by not buying newspapers any more.\nThe decline of thoughtful media has been discussed for a century. This is not new.

And having gotten away with it so far, we\u2019re now considering removing the law from our memory.\nThe economics seem to be that the only way to make a living is to reach a lot of people and the only way to reach a lot of people is to race to the bottom, seek out quick clicks, make it easy to swallow, reinforce existing beliefs, keep it short, make it sort of fun, or prurient, or urgent, and most of all, dumb it down.\nAnd that\u2019s the true danger of anti-intellectualism. While it\u2019s foolish to choose to be stupid, it\u2019s cultural suicide to decide that insights, theories and truth don\u2019t actually matter. If we don\u2019t care to learn more, we won\u2019t spend time or resources on knowledge.\nWe can survive if we eat candy for an entire day, but if we put the greenmarkets out of business along the way, all that\u2019s left is candy.\nGive your kid a tablet, a game, and some chicken fingers for dinner. It\u2019s easier than talking to him.\nRead the short articles, the ones with pictures, it\u2019s simpler than digging deep.\nClickbait works for a reason. Because people click on it.\nThe thing about clickbait, though, is that it exists to catch prey, not to inform them. It\u2019s bait, after all.\nThe good news: We don\u2019t need many people to demand more from the media before the media responds. The Beverly Hillbillies were a popular show, but that didn\u2019t stop Star Trek from having a shot at improving the culture.\nThe media has always bounced between pandering to make a buck and upping the intellectual ante of what they present. Now that this balance has been ceded to an algorithm, we\u2019re on the edge of a breakneck race to the bottom, with no brakes and no break in sight.\nVote with your clicks, with your sponsorship, with your bookstore dollars. Vote with your conversations, with your letters to the editor, by changing the channel\u2026\nEven if only a few people use precise\u00a0words, employ thoughtful reasoning and ask difficult questions, it still forces those around them to catch up. It\u2019s easy to imagine a slippery slope down, but there\u2019s also the cultural ratchet, a positive function in which people race to learn more and understand more so they can keep up with those around them.\nTurn the ratchet. We can lead our way back to curiosity, inquiry and discovery if we (just a few for now) measure the right things and refuse the easy option in favor of insisting on better."}]}

If you\u2019re installing eyelets at a Nike factory, they measure your output to the tenth of a second. I\u2019m not talking about that. I\u2019m writing this for people who are given the freedom to solve problems or create opportunities at work.\nLike most things, there\u2019s a spectrum of approaches. In this case, I think the two ends of the spectrum are an approach ofAbundanceand an approach I callTechnically Beyond Reproach(TBR).\nAbundance means that you look at every problem spec and figure out how to make it bigger.TBR tries to make it smaller.\nAbundance means that you spend a lot of time imagining how you will overdeliver.TBR means you start from the beginning making sure that the work you do will either meet spec or you\u2019ll have a really good excuse.\nEntrepeneurs have a hard time with the TBR approach, because it has never ever worked for them. VCs and customers and competitors give few bonus points for excuses, even really good ones, so the only approach that wins is the abundance one.\nAn abundant-approach employee shows up early so she won\u2019t need the \"train was late\" excuse on the day of the presentation. The TBR employee gets a note from the Metro. (true story).\nAn abundant-approach minister grows his church from 200 families to 3,000 by constantly reinventing what he does all day. A TBR minister does a very good job of consoling the sick and writing sermons.\nIs there somethingwrongwith the TBR approach? It depends what you want. If you want to grow, TBR won\u2019t get you there. (ThePurple Cowwas not about being garish or outlandish. It was, I know realize, about thinking abundantly). Yes, I probably want my airline pilot to be TBR, at least most of the time. But no, not the chef at the restaurant.\nThere are whole industries built around TBR thinking. The weddingbusinessfor example, charges extra so the bride and her mom will be blameless. The \"top\" colleges offer an expensive degree that is also beyond reproach, \"Hey, it\u2019s not my fault\u2026 I paid my dues, went to a great school\u2026\"\nThe fascinating thing about the transparency of the Net is that it makes it easy to measure the differences between the two approaches. There are a bazillion blogs, andtechnoratimakes it easy to see which ones have popped. And those are? Those are the ones that didn\u2019t follow the blogging manual, that didn\u2019t diligently do what they were supposed to do, but instead, they were run with an abundance mindset. The blogger chose to answer a bigger question, in a bigger way.\nI think what it comes down to is the first question you ask yourself when you see an opportunity or a challenge.\nIs it, \"How can I make this bigger, do it faster and change the outcome for all of us?\"or is it\"If this doesn\u2019t work, will I get in trouble or will I be okay?\""}]}

Many admit only one in ten students. According to two senior officials at Swarthmore, the differences among the \u2018good enough\u2019 applicants is basically zero. Rather than putting tens of thousands of kids through insane anxiety, they wonder, why not just put all the \u2018good enough\u2019 students in a pool and pick the winners randomly?\nHere\u2019s the amazing part: According toThe Chosen, an exhaustive study of college admissions, there\u2019s no measurable difference between the outcomes of education with the most exclusive schools and the next few tiers. Graduates don\u2019t end up happier. They don\u2019t end up with better paying jobs. They don\u2019t end up richer or even healthier.\u00a0 The whole thing is a sham (which costs a quarter of a million dollars a person at the top end).\nThere\u2019s no question that a Harvard degree helps (or is even required) in a few fields. There\u2019s also no doubt that spending four years at Yale is a mind-changing experience. The question isn\u2019t, \"are they wonderful?\" The question is, \"Is it worth it?\"\nIt\u2019s almost as if every single high school student and her parents insisted on having a $200,000 stereo because it was better than the $1,000 stereo. Sure, it might be a bit better, but is it betterenough?\nBoomer parents have bought in to the marketing hype at a level rarely seen in any other form of marketing. They push school districts, teachers and their kids to perform pointless tasks at extreme levels just to be admitted to the \u2018right\u2019 school, even though there\u2019s hardly evidence that the right school does anything but boost their egos.\nSchools respond by spending a fortune on facilities that will increase their rankings in various faux polls, even though there\u2019s no evidence at all that a better gym or a bigger library matters one bit to an undergraduate\u2019s long-term success in life.\nIf it weren\u2019t so expensive (in terms of time and money) it would make a marvelous marketing case study. Add in the tears and wasted anxiety and it\u2019s really a shame. Very few people are pointing out that the emperor is barely clothed, and those that do (like me, I guess) get yelled at.\nI\u2019m not criticizing a college education per se. No, it\u2019s clear that that\u2019s a smart investment. I\u2019m talking about the incremental cost (and anxiety) separating consumers of the \u2018top\u2019 500 schools from students of the \u2018top\u2019 50. It appears to be pure storytelling, a story that so appeals to the worldview of baby boomers with teens that they are absolutely unable to resist the story, despite the facts.\nHigh school students are thrust into a Dip, in some cases the biggest one of their lives.The Dipextracts significant costs along the way, and then ends with a giant spin of the roulette wheel. I wonder if we\u2019re marketing ourselves to a dead end.\nI guess I\u2019d do two things. First, I\u2019d figure out how to teach parents to understand what really matters and what doesn\u2019t about time spent in high school and the choice of a college. Second, I\u2019d push for every selective college to share one application and do a draft similar to the one they do for medical residencies. Every applicant ranks the schools they\u2019d like to attend, in order. Every school considers all the applications, grabs the students they\u2019d love to have in priority order, puts the rest into the \"good enough\" pile and lets a computer sort em all out as pareto optimally as possible. At least kids will go into their twenties correctly blaming a computer instead of mistakenly blaming themselves."}]}

But we\u2019re all connectors.\nTim O\u2019Reilly coined the termWeb 2.0.It is a bit controversial, but basically it describes a generation of web pages that go beyond the flat HTML of the original Web. Web 2.0 pages encourage community and user-generated content.\nWeb 3is the brainchild of Tim Berners-Lee, largely credited for inventing the world wide web in the first place. It\u2019s more commonly called the Semantic Web. The idea is, to quote Lee, \"I have a dream for the Web [in which computers] become capable ofanalyzing all the data on the Web \u2013 the content, links, andtransactions between people and computers. A \u2018Semantic Web\u2019, whichshould make this possible, has yet to emerge, but when it does, theday-to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy and our daily lives will behandled by machines talking to machines. The \u2018intelligent agents\u2019people have touted for ages will finally materialize.\"\nI\u2019ll get in trouble for this simple shorthand, but it\u2019s data about data. Websites that are smart about what they are and what they contain. But what\u2019s it for? I mean it\u2019s very audacious and powerful, but why? And what drives it to work?\nThe opportunities of the semantic web are limitless, and I can\u2019t wait. But that\u2019s not Web4. Web4 is what I\u2019m really waiting for. And it\u2019s entirely possible that Web4 will get here before the semantic web even though Web 3 makes it work a lot better.\nWe start with this:\nWe need ubiquity to build Web4, because it is about activity, not just data, and most human activity takes place offline.\nWe need identity to build Web4, because the deliverable is based on who you are and what you do and what you need.\nAnd we need connection to build Web4, because you\u2019re nothing without the rest of us.\nWeb4 is about making connections, about serendipity and about the network taking initiative.\nSome deliberately provocative examples:\nI\u2019m typing an email to someone, and we\u2019re brainstorming about doing a business development deal with Apple. A little window pops up and lets me know that David over in our Tucscon office is already having a similar conversation with Apple and perhaps we should coordinate.\nI\u2019m booked on a flight from Toledo to Seattle. It\u2019s cancelled. My phone knows that I\u2019m on the flight, knows that it\u2019s cancelled and knows what flights I should consider instead. It uses semantic data but it also has permission to interrupt me and tell me about it. Much more important, it knows what my colleagues are doing in response to this event and tells me. \u2018Follow me\u2019 gets a lot easier.\nGoogle watches what I search. It watches what other people like me search. Every day, it shows me things I ought to be searching for that I\u2019m not. And it introduces me to people who are searching for what I\u2019m searching for.\nAs a project manager, my computer knows my flow chart and dependencies for what we\u2019re working on. And so does the computer of every person on the project, inside my team and out. As soon as something goes wrong (or right) the entire chart updates.\nI\u2019m late for a dinner. My GPS phone knows this (because it has my calendar, my location, and the traffic status). So, it tells me, and then it alerts the people who are waiting for me.\nI visit a blog for the first time. My browser knows what sort of stories I am interested in and shows me highlights of the new blog based on that history.\nI can invest in stocks as part of a team, a team that gains strength as it grows in size.\nHere\u2019sRikard\u2019s riffon how the iPhone could be more like Web4.\nI\u2019m about to buy something from a vendor (in a store with a smart card or online). At the last minute, Web4 jumps in and asks if I want it cheaper, or if I want it from a vendor with a better reputation. Not based on some gamed system, but based on what a small trusted circle believes.\nMy PDA knows I\u2019m going to a convention. Based on my email logs, it recommends who I ought to see while I\u2019m there\u2013because my friends have opted in to our network and we\u2019re in sync.\nI can fly to the CES for half price, because Web4 finds enough of us that we can charter a flight.\nI don\u2019t have to wait for Rickie Lee Jones to come to town. Sonos knows who the Rickie Lee fans are, and makes it easy for us to get together and initiate a concert\u2026 we book her, no scalpers necessary.\nI don\u2019t get company spam any more (\"fill out your TPS reports\") because whenever anyone in my group of extended colleagues highlights a piece of corporate spam, it\u2019s gone for all of us. But wait, it\u2019s also smart enough that when a recipient highlights a mail as worth reading, it goes to the top of my queue. If, over time, the system senses (from how long I read the mail, or that I delete it, or that I don\u2019t take action) that the guy\u2019s recommendations are lame, he loses cred.\nSure, it sounds a bit like LinkedIn. But it\u2019s not. LinkedIn tends to make networks that are sprawling and weak. Web4 is about smaller, far more intense connections with trusted colleagues and their activities. It\u2019s a tribe.\nYou don\u2019t have to join a tribe. But if you did, would you be more successful?\nUnlike Web 3, we don\u2019t need every single page in the world to be \u2018compliant.\u2019 What we need is:\nThis stuff creeps some people out. The thing is, privacy is an illusion. You think you have privacy, but the video surveillance firms and your credit card company disagree. If we\u2019re already on camera, we might as well get some benefits from it. If we choose.\nI think it\u2019s fascinating that Web4 is coming from the edges (we see all sorts of tribal activities popping up in blogs, communities, rankings, Digg, etc.) as opposed to from the center. Web 2.0 happened in largely the same way. Even online, big organizations seem to have the most trouble innovating in ways that change the game."}]}

A \u2018customer service\u2019 rep who will happily reread a company policy six or seven times but never stop to actually consider what the policy means. A marketing executive who buys millions of dollars of TV time even though she knows it\u2019s not working\u2013she does it because her boss told her to.\nIt\u2019s ironic but not surprising that in our age of increased reliance on new ideas, rapid change and innovation, sheepwalking is actually on the rise. That\u2019s because we can no longer rely on machines to do the brain-dead stuff.\nWe\u2019ve mechanized what we could mechanize. What\u2019s left is to cost-reduce the manual labor that must be done by a human. So we write manuals and race to the bottom in our search for the cheapest possible labor. And it\u2019s not surprising that when we go to hire that labor, we search for people who have already been trained to be sheepish.\nTraining a student to be sheepish is a lot easier than the alternative. Teaching to the test, ensuring compliant behavior and using fear as a motivator are the easiest and fastest ways to get a kid through school. So why does it surprise us that we graduate so many sheep?\nAnd graduate school? Since the stakes are higher (opportunity cost, tuition and the job market), students fall back on what they\u2019ve been taught. To be sheep. Well-educated, of course, but compliant nonetheless.\nAnd many organizations go out of their way to hire people that color inside the lines, that demonstrate consistency and compliance. And then they give these people jobs where they are managed via fear. Which leads to sheepwalking. (\u201cI might get fired!\u201d)\nThe fault doesn\u2019t lie with the employee, at least not at first. And of course, the pain is often shouldered by both the employee and thecustomer.\nIs it less efficient to pursue the alternative? What happens when you build an organization like Goretex or the Acumen Fund? At first, it seems crazy. There\u2019s too much overhead, too many cats to herd, too little predictability and way too much noise. Then, over and over, we see something happen. When you hire amazing people and give them freedom, they do amazing stuff.\nAnd the sheepwalkers and their bosses just watch and shake their heads,certain that this is just an exception, and that it is way too riskyfor their industry or their customer base.\nI was at a Google conference last month, and I spent some time in a room filled with (pretty newly minted) Google salesreps. I talked to a few of them for a while about the state of the industry. And it broke my heart to discover that they were sheepwalking.\nJust like the receptionist at a company I visited a week later. She acknowledged that the front office is very slow, and that she just sits there, reading romance novels and waiting. And she\u2019s been doing it for two years.\nJust like the MBA student I met yesterday who is taking a job at a major packaged goods company\u2026 because they offered her a great salary and promised her a well-known brand. She\u2019s going to stay, \u201cfor just ten years, then have a baby and leave and start my own gig\u2026\u201d She\u2019ll get really good at running coupons in the Sunday paper, but not particularly good at solving new problems.\nWhat a waste.\nStep one is to give the problem a name. Done. Step two is for anyone who sees themself in this mirror to realize that you can always stop. You can always claim the career you deserve merely by refusing to walk down the same path as everyone else just because everyone else is already doing it.\nThe biggest step, though, comes from anyone who teaches or hires. And that\u2019s to embrace non-sheep behavior, to reward it and cherish it. As we\u2019ve seen just about everywhere there\u2019s been growth lately, that\u2019s where the good stuff happens.\n[I just reread this, and I\u2019m betting some people will think I\u2019m being way too harsh. That depends. It depends on whether you believe that people have a considerable amount of innate potential, that work is too time-consuming to be dull and that organizations need passion (from employees and from customers) if they want to grow. If you believe that the relationship between marketers and the people they touch is important enough to invest in.\u00a0 I think if you believe all that, if you believe in yourself and your co-workers, then this isn\u2019t nearly harsh enough. We need to hurry. We need to wake up.]"}]}

It's a wasteful process, because success is unpredictable and unevenly distributed.\nThe internet has largely mirrored (and amplified) this competition. eBay, for example, not only pits sellers against one another, it also pits buyers. Craigslist makes it easy for buyers to see the range of products and services on offer, making the marketplace more competitive. Google, most of all, encourages an ecosystem where producers can evolve, improve and compete.\nI think the next frontier of the net is going to use the datastream to do precisely the opposite\u2013to create value by making coordination easier.\nA pre-internet pioneer of this: the method residents are assigned to hospitals after med school (theMatch). The competitive way to do this is the same way we do college\u2013we tell students to apply to a ton of schools, and perhaps you get into four, perhaps you get into none. Perhaps someone else gets into your favorite and chooses not to go\u2026 while you're left behind.\nThe Matchcoordinatesinstead. You tell the system your favorites, in rank order, and it uses application feedback from the hospitals to maximize the happiness of the largest number of applicants. No sense wasting scarce acceptances on people unable to work in two places at once.\nConsider the wayLogosis determining which books to bring out. They challenge readers to indicate the most they'd be willing to pay for a particular title, and then, based on the number of people voting with their dollars, can bring out titles at the lowest possible price for the largest number of people.\nIn both cases, the system works because it can become aware of buyer preferences in advance. Kickstarter takes this to an extreme, allowing producers to pre-sell items before making them. But this is not nearly as nuanced as it could be, and a lot of effort is wasted in acquiring the attention of potential purchasers.\nAny wasting asset\u2013a restaurant table, a seat at a conference, a wasting box of fish\u2013can be efficiently used instead of wasted if we use technology to identify and coordinate buyers.\nSynchronizing buyers to improve efficiency and connection is a high-value endeavor, and it's right around the corner. It will permit mesh products, better conferences, higher productivity and less waste, while giving significant new power to consumers and those that organize them."}]}

Restaurants aren\u2019t allowed to easily spread tips around, and as a result, they tend to to exacerbate many of the inequities in our culture at the same time that they make it hard to count on a fair wage in one of the largest industries in the world.\nThat said, one reason for the stickiness of tipping is that the act of doing it offers benefits to the customers.\nThe first is ritual. It\u2019s what we grew up doing, and leaving it out feels awkward.\nThe second is control. The person leaving a tip is given a vivid reminder of their power as a customer. \u201cTo insure prompt service\u201d might not be the origin of the term, but it can feel that way. It gives the customer a sense of control.\nAnother is status. At fancy restaurants in New York, experiments with eliminating tipping have had little success, and one reason is that regular customers enjoyed the way it allowed them to subtly (not that subtly) demonstrate their status to their guests.\nA recent one is the labeling and sorting of the internet. Restaurants and resorts that include gratuities in their fees get hammered in search, because they seem more expensive than they are.\nPart of the persistence of cultural norms comes from our desire for there to be a norm. When two people split a check, it\u2019s not unusual for them to compare how much they\u2019re leaving in a tip. Why? After all, people don\u2019t walk across a restaurant to ask a stranger to be sure they\u2019re in sync. But giving the \u2018right\u2019 amount, or perhaps just a bit over or just bit under is part of our desire to establish our place in a hierarchy.\nHow to cut this knot? If tipping is a service (for customers or staff) how to make it more than an afterthought?\nIf the goal is to keep tipping, then we have the chance to create the conditions where the tipper feels really good about the practice. Simple cues, an easy way to find oneself in the hierarchy, a way to know you\u2019re tipping the \u2018right amount.\u2019 Or perhaps the sort of signaling that we see in nightclubs when someone orders a really expensive bottle for the table\u2013how do we give customers the chance to put a show about their tipping in a way that benefits the customer as well as the server?\nOn the other hand, if the goal is to eliminate tipping, different stategies can be put to work.\nImagine a resort that prides itself on service. Instead of asking for a tip the last day, a note might say, \u201cThanks for joining us, and supporting our mission in creating a magical place to work and visit. We\u2019ve already charged your card, which includes a hospitality fee. If anyone on the property contributed to the quality of your stay, please let us know and we\u2019ll make sure to celebrate their work.\u201d\nService is at the heart of our economy now. Perhaps it\u2019s worth rethinking how we recognize it and pay for it."}]}

A kid who graduates from high school has options, can see a way up, which decreases the power of the gang and its leaders. Public school is seen as a threat by some tribes, a secular indoctrination and an exposure to other cultures and points of view that might destabilize what has been built over generations. And digital audio is a threat to those in the vinyl tribe, because at some point, some members may decide they\u2019ve had enough of the old school.\nLately, two significant threats seen by some tribes are the scientific method and the power of a government (secular, or worse, representing a majority tribe). One fear is that once someone understands the power of inquiry, theory, testing and informed criticism, they will be unwilling to embrace traditional top-down mythology. The other is that increased government power will enforce standards and rituals that undermine the otherness that makes each tribe distinct.\nIf a tribe requires its members to utter loyalty oaths to be welcomed [\u201cthe president is always right, carbon pollution is a myth, no ____ allowed (take your pick)\u201d] they will bump into reality more and more often.

An alert sentry changed the clock in the square an hour. Brilliant! The insiders, unaided by their allies, started their diversion an hour early. They were all arrested.\nBut i digress. This book makes you do that.\nLobbying for DST started in earnest about 100 years ago.

It if hadn\u2019t been for the need to save energy during WWI, it never would have been instituted\u2013the forces against change refused to accept how much money would be saved (turns out it is millions and millions of dollars a year, probably billions by now) and were against it in general principle.\nSir William Christie, Astronomer Royal, called DST nothing but special legislation for late risers (ah, the moral failing card).\nSir William Napier Shaw, director of the Meteorological office said, \"To alter the prsent mode of measuring time would be to kill a goose that lays a very valuable egg.\"\nNature magazine said, \"The advance from local to the standard time of today was a step well thought out, and one that cannot be reversed by the introduction of a new and really nondescript time under the old name.\"\nThe Secretary of the London Stock Exchange, Mr. Satterthwaite said the bill would, \"Create a dislocation of Stock Exchange business in the chief business centre of the world.\"\nOf course, many reactionaries with nothing concrete to say merely mocked William Willet, the chief proponent of the change.Naturewondered if his next trick was going to be to redefine the thermometer so that in the winter it would be 42 degrees instead of 32.\nThe theatre owners united (RIAA flashback!) and worked hard to defeat the bill, saying that if it weren\u2019t dark at night, their business would be completely decimated.\nYear after year, the bill failed to pass in the UK. In the US the story was much the same.\nThe New York Times wrote, this is, \"little less than an act of madness.\"\n[more soon] later\u00a0 [okay, now it\u2019s soon\u2026]\nMy very favorite quote of all comes from Mississippi.\n\"Repeal the law and have the clocks proclaim God\u2019s time and tell the truth!\" That comes from Congressman Ezekiel Candler, Jr.\nAnd Harry Hull of Iowa said, \"When we passed the law, we tried to \u2018put one over\u2019 on Mother Nature, and when you try to improve the natural laws it usually ends in disaster.\"\nAfter the law passed, there were court battles everywhere.

We see the folks who manage to skate by, or who get so much more than we think they deserve, and it\u2019s easy to forget that:\na. these guys are the exceptionsandb. there\u2019s nothing you can do about it anyway.\nAnd that\u2019s the key to the paradox of effort: While luck may be more appealing than effort, you don\u2019t get to choose luck. Effort, on the other hand, is totally available, all the time.\nThis is a hard sell. Diet books that say, \"eat less, exercise more,\" may work, but they don\u2019t sell many copies.\nWith that forewarning, here\u2019s a bootstrapper\u2019s/marketer\u2019s/entrepreneur\u2019s/fast-rising executive\u2019s effort diet. Go through the list and decide whether or not it\u2019s worth it. Or make up your own diet. Effort is a choice, at least make it on purpose:\n1. Delete 120 minutes a day of \u2018spare time\u2019 from your life. This can include TV, reading the newspaper, commuting, wasting time in social networks and meetings. Up to you.\n2. Spend the 120 minutes doing this instead:\n3. Spend at least one weekend day doing absolutely nothing but being with people you love.\n4. Only spend money, for one year, on things you absolutely need to get by. Save the rest, relentlessly.\nIf you somehow pulled this off, then six months from now, you would be the fittest, best rested, most intelligent, best funded and motivated person in your office or your field. You would know how to do things other people don\u2019t, you\u2019d have a wider network and you\u2019d be more focused.\nIt\u2019s entirely possible that this won\u2019t be sufficient, and you will continue to need better luck. But it\u2019s a lot more likely you\u2019ll get lucky, I bet."}]}

I'm talking about how you work as a client for a project that needs to make something.\nIt might be an internal team developing a website or it might be an outside designer working on a logo. Regardless of the team's make up, as their client, you walk a fine line. On one hand, you want their best, most creative insight, delivered with passion. On the other, you want the people you represent (your boss, the customers) to be happy with what gets made.\nWhich leads to the feedback part. (Not criticism, feedback).\nWhat do you do when the work that comes in is no good? When it's off target or needs tweaking or even an overhaul?\nIn my experience, there are three different ways to structure the project. Each leads to a very different feedback loop.\n1. The goal of the team is to please you.\n2. The goal of the team is to make a product that they love and are proud of building.\n3. The goal of the team is to build a great product.\nThere's more difference between #2 and #3 than it appears.\nThe first scenario is quite common. It leads to mindreader syndrome, in which alert team members work hard to get you to tell them what you want. If they can read your mind, they'll be successful (and done) that much sooner. The real problem with this approach is that the team has rarely bought in to the project. They don't take ownership because, after all, the goal is to make you happy. They won't give you more than you expect, because they're trying so hard to give you exactly what you expect. This is especially problematic when the team thinks you're an erratic, egomaniacal nutcase with little or no real world chops.\nThe second scenario is common with well-known freelance help, or agencies or other creatives that bring ego to the table. In this situation, anything you say about the project appears to be a personal attack. That's because, in the eyes of the person that came to you saying, \"here isour work,\" itisa personal attack. If you don't like my logo or strategy or code, well, of course I'm going to be defensive.\nYou can work with people like this successfully, but to do so involves giving them a clean sheet of paper, not being part of the development process.\nThe third scenario is the one in which all sides want the best possible projectandthe team believes that you have valuable insight on how to make that happen. This only works if there's mutual respect around the table. They have to hold you in esteem and trust your judgment (not organizational judgment, but judgment about what makes the project great). That means that, \"because I said so,\" is not effective feedback.\nI've seen all three work. The first scenario is really efficient if you are truly in charge, you know what you want and you don't have a lot of time. The second scenario works if you absolutely trust the team and want them to push the envelope. And the third scenario works when you have mature people, a dedicated team and enough time and mutual respect to work it through.\nHow do you develop the trust and esteem you need in the third example? Sit with the team and jointly criticize other work. Before you start developing, spend time giviing feedback on how someone else could have done a better job (on a design, on the foley in a movie, on a logo). By earning the right to give feedback externally, you make it more likely you've got the right to do it internally."}]}

An Overnight failure?\nThe idea of an overnight success is relatively new. Joan of Arc, Robin Hood and Sarah Bernhardt were not overnight successes. It took media (the old kind, like TV and movies, and especially the new kind, like Google video) to create the overnight success. My friends Pomme and Kelly are overnight successes. So are some of the characters on American Idol.\nAlong the way, some people have trained themselves to believe that the only kind of success worth having is overnight success. That if you don\u2019t hit #1 the first week, you\u2019ve failed. That if your interface isn\u2019t perfect out of the box, or if you don\u2019t get 5,000 peoplestanding in lineat the opening of your new store, you\u2019ve failed.\nThe Times today reports onKathleen McGowan, easily considered an overnight failure.

Day after day was spent slogging her way to any person willing to look at it. This year, of course, she\u2019s back with a million dollar plus advance, feted by booksellers, the whole drill.\nSquidoois another interesting case. Here\u2019s a look at our daily traffic, courtesy of our Google Analytics package, since January (I removed four weeks in mid-March, mid-April, because of a glitch with search.)\u00a0 Squidoo has more than 27,000 lenses built by 15,000 people in about five months. No, the chart doesn\u2019t look like MySpace or Flickr. What it does look like is the early days of Google and Wikipedia and other overnight failures.\nThe challenge for observers, investors and partners (like the publisher who took on Kathleen) is to avoid the temptation of buying the media infatuation with the overnight success story (which rarely happens overnight). The challenge for marketers is to figure out what daily progress looks\u00a0 like and obsess about that.\nThe goal, I think, is to be an overnight failure, but one that persists. Keeping costs low, building a foundation that leads to the right kind of story, the right kind of organic growth. Kathleen wrote a book that she believes in, one that was worth investing years of her life into. And then she painstakingly made progress until she became the next big thing."}]}

More people than ever go to work to use their minds, not just their hands. And more people than ever have a platform to share their point of view. I think that raises the bar for our understanding of how the world works.\nLet\u2019s assert for the moment that you get paid to create, manipulate or spread ideas. That you don\u2019t get paid to lift bricks or hammer steel. If you\u2019re in the idea business, what\u2019s going to improve your career, get you a better job, more respect or a happier day? Forgive me for suggesting (to those not curious enough to read this blog and others) that it might be reading blogs,booksor even watchingTEDtalks.\nAs for the deliberately uninformed, we can ignore them or we can reach out to them and hopefully start a pattern of people thinking for themselves\u2026"}]}

After all, why would someone want to connect to a selfish organization? But the critical need for generosity as an element of our new economy is easy to get lost because it leads to the question, \u201cwhat is generosity?\u201d\nThe obvious answer, I think, is the wrong one. Generosity is not merely giving a discount, or giving what you make away or creating a race to the bottom. It\u2019s far more complex than that. Some thoughts:\nIt\u2019s understandable that generosity creates trust, but also worth noting thattrustis required to provide generosity. If a well-meaning person started leaving sandwiches all over the airport departures lounge, her goal probably wouldn\u2019t be achieved, because we just don\u2019t trust random unwrapped sandwiches left anonymously in public places.\nThat\u2019s one reason why it seems so difficult to give ideas away online. We don\u2019t know you, so we don\u2019t trust you, perhaps not even enough to invest the time to find out what it is you\u2019re trying to give us or how you're working to help us. Earning this trust, in an effort to be generous, is time consuming and dissuades some from going down this path. Sometimes this effort leads marketers to spam, to take shortcuts, to lie, all in a self-justified but ultimately doomed and deluded effort to be generous.\nSacrificeis a crucial element in our perception of generosity. When someone takes the time to share a finite resource, one that they cannot hope to be repaid for, generosity happens. So favors can\u2019t be generous, because favors imply a sort of gift economy of repayment being due.\nKindnessalso rides along with generosity. When someone is generous with us but does it begrudgingly, just this one time, don\u2019t ask again, face scrunched with tension, then no, it doesn\u2019t feel generous.\nDanny Meyerhas revolutionized restaurant culture around the world (starting with Union Square Cafe and then with many other eating places) by placing an emphasis on generosity. Not the (sometimes unwanted) generosity of huge portions, nor the discounting approach of charging ever less, but in the generosity we feel when we\u2019re waited on by someone who treats us with genuine humanity, with kindness and with care.\nA variation on kindness isdesign. It\u2019s entirely possible to create buildings or signs or products that are brutally efficient, where no effort is put into grace or style or beauty. But when the creator of the thing also donates the extra time and care to make it magical, it feels generous, a generosity that scales to all who use it.\nThere is also the generosity that we feel when someone comes with rightintent. People likeBernadette Jiwa,Tina Roth EisenbergandMitch Joelhave no ulterior motive in the work they share online. They share because they can, because turning on a light for themselves also turns on a light for others. This is not the trading-up version of selfish networking, it\u2019s merely generous.\nVulnerability, asBrene Brownandothershave written about, is a key element of what it is to be human, to make art and thus to be generous. The vulnerability of showing up and caring and connecting, even if this time, it might not resonate. And yes, vulnerablity builds trust, all in an endless cycle.\nAnd the killer of generosity isbitterness. You may have noticed while traveling on airlines like American that many of the employees you encounter act as though they\u2019re trapped. Trapped by a race to the bottom in efficiency, trapped by a long history of bureaucracy that offers no control and no room for humanity. In those situations, it\u2019s easy to give up, to shrug one\u2019s shoulders and to soldier on, just doing your job. It\u2019s not surprising, then, that any attempt at organizational kindness instead feels like a poorly constructed marketing come-on, not the human act of generosity we seek.\nWe long to connect, all of us. We long to be noticed, to be cared for, to matter. Generosity is the invisible salve on our wound of loneliness, one that benefits both sides, over and over again."}]}

There isn\u2019t a feeling of scarcity, that the store will run out if it\u2019s free\u2026\nBut of course, this overlooks the two-and-a-half essential missing factors:\nI like paying for my software when I\u2019m buying it from a company that\u2019s responsive, fast and focused. I like being the customer (as opposed to a social network, where I\u2019m the product). I spend most of my day working with tools that weren\u2019t even in science fiction novels twenty-five years ago, and the money I spend on software is a bargain\u2013doing this work without it is impossible.\nTo name a few, I\u2019m glad to use and pay for:Overcast,Feedblitz,Discourse,Zapier,Dropbox,Roon,WavePad,Bench,Nisus,Zoom,Slack,SuperDuper,Mailchimp,Hover,TypeExpander,Tidal, and many others. IwishI could pay for and get great support and development for Keynote. And I\u2019m sorry I ever encountered the one or two rare exceptions in an industry that generally does amazing work with care and responsibility.\nIn my experience, the great software companies are run by singleminded people who bend the physics of design to their will, creating powerful leverage for those that they serve. They are craftspeople, impatient with the status quo and eager to make things better.\nIn many ways, software development has plateaued, and part of the reason is that people hesitate to pay for software worth paying for. I\u2019m looking forward to the next golden age of tools that open new doors for creators and organizations.\nPS here\u2019s a ten-year oldtalkon this topic. And asequela few years later."}]}

The waffling candidate, the one who hesitates to give a clear yes or no answer to every question is seen as weak.\n(Worth noting that the word \"waffling\" didn't startappearing in booksmuch until after the 1960 elections).\nOf course, this post isn't about politics at all. Customers and employees and vendors and regulators almost always prefer simplicity and certainty.\nThere are two ways to begin an answer to most questions we face in organizations:\n\"It's simple\" and\n\"It's complicated.\"\nBoth are usually true. At 10,000 feet, most challenges are simple. But actually making something work is quite complicated.\nNuance is the sign of an intelligent observer. Nuance shows restaint and maturity and an understanding of the underlying mechanics of whatever problem we're wrestling with. After all, if the solution was simple, we would have solved it already.\nOn the other hand, resorting to nuance early and often can also be a sign of fear, of an unwillingness to go out on a limb and make a difference. Hence the reactions of boards hiring consultants and CEOs, or of passionate primary voters. \"Don't tell me it's complicated. Just show me the guts to make something happen.\"\nMy vote: your goals and your strategy must be simple. You must have passion and certainty in order to make a difference as a leader. Your tactics, on the other hand, should be layered, multi-dimensional and reflect the patience of someone who cares about reaching a goal.\nWhen Howard Schultz talks about coffee or Jill Greenberg talks about lighting or Cory Booker talks about education, they can impatiently demand clear and simple results. At the same time, successful leaders see the nuance they'll need in executing to get there.\nThe paradox is that the simplicity we often seek in search of solutions rarely leads to the patient leadership we need to get them.\nThe irony is not lost on me\u2026 the decision on when to be bold is a nuanced one."}]}

You focus on per issue sales, you worry about people sharing a paper (!), you don\u2019t count online readers as valuable (even though they\u2019remorevaluable). You focus on one edition, not a thousand different versions.

Somehow, they say, I've crossed the boundary of what I'm allowed to write about. They are angry that I'm now writing about something outside my defined area.\nI'm usually taken aback by this, because I didn't realize I'd actually agreed to any boundaries.\nBrands run into this all the time. Consumers give them boundaries. Nike isn't allowed to make a computer, for example (unless they partner with Apple). It turns out, though, that marketers decide to believe in these boundaries a lot more than consumers do.\nA beautifully made product or service (one that we agree with) gets a lot of slack, regardless of its source. Virgin is a great example of this. Branson can market cola and airplanes with the same brand, largely because we like what he makes. In Korea, there are a few massive brands that are 'allowed' to market anything they like, from dishwashers to cars. Google is allowed to market the very cool newSquares, of course.\nThe real problem is that when marketers believe they are going out of bounds, the work they do tends to be lousy. Starbucks attempt at chocolate, for example, wasn't as good at being chocolate as their coffee is at being coffee.I think that's because the marketers at Starbucks feel they have permission to care about coffee, but chocolate is merely an extension, an additional profit center, not a passion.\nI'm not arguing for carte blanche craziness with your brand. American Express can do travelers checks and credit cards and could have done PayPal\u2026 but no, they probably shouldn't launch a line of whiskey any time soon.

So does it make sense for me to continue focusing on mastering the violin?\"\nWithout fear of error, I think it's easy to say that this woman will never become the best violinist in the world. That's because it's essentially impossible to be the one and only best violinist in the world. There might be 5,000 or 10,000 people who are so technically good at it as to be indistinguishable to all but a handful of orchestra listeners. This is true for many competitive fields\u2013we might want to fool ourselves into thinking that we have become the one and only best at a technical skill, but it's extremely unlikely.\nThe quest for technical best is a form of hiding. You can hide from the marketplace because you're still practicing your technique. And you can hide from the hard work of real art and real connection because you decide that success lies in being the best technically, at getting a 99 instead of a 98 on an exam.\nWhat wecanbecome the best at is being an idiosyncratic exception to the standard. Joshua Bell is often mentioned (when violinists are mentioned at all) not because he is technically better than every other violinst, but because of his charisma and willingness to cross categories. He's the best in the world at being Josh Bell, not the best in the world at playing the violin.\nThe same trap happens to people who are coding in Java, designing furniture or training to be a corporate coach. It's a seductive form of self motivation, the notion that we can push and push and stay inside the lines and through sheer will, become technically perfect and thus in demand. Alas, it's not going to happen for most of us.\n[The flipside of this are the practioners who bolster themselves up by claiming that they are, in fact, the most technically adept in the world. In my experience, they're fibbing to themselves when they'd be better off taking the time and effort to practice their craft. Just saying it doesn't make it so.]\nUntil we're honest with ourselves about what we're going to master, there's no chance we'll accomplish it."}]}

You can\u2019t get elected in Iowa without pigging out at the Fair and you can\u2019t host a party without stocking up on the chips. Somehow, food marketing became a story about respect.

People might not like you if you challenge the food dynamic.\nThere\u2019s always been a cultural desire to conform. The difference is that now there\u2019s money at stake, so marketers push us to conform in ways that turn a profit.\nMarketers, brilliant, profit-oriented marketers, have had a century to teach us to associate respect and kindness and love with certain kinds of food.\nAnd that\u2019s why this post isn\u2019t just a screed, it\u2019s a lesson for marketers everywhere.\n\u2026Just as the jewelry and floral people have taught us that flowers and diamonds=love and that a respectable gentleman spends two months salary (!) on an engagement ring.

It\u2019s not just a network of users, it\u2019s anetworkof servers as well. No one owns it.Like email, it\u2019s a set of principles and rules, not a place. A federation is different than a corporation. It might not be as shiny, but it\u2019s far more resilient.\nIt\u2019s inconvenient. You can\u2019t get started in ten seconds. This leads to less initial stickiness. It means that the people who get through the learning curve are more likely to be committed and perhaps generous. In the early days of email, of Compuserve, of AOL, of the web, of just about every network I\u2019ve been part of, these early users created a different sort of magic. It never lasts, but it\u2019s great to see.\nI started one of the first internet companies in 1990, and the new frontiers tend to rhyme with each other. This might be one.\nPart of the power of a network is its distributed nature. That\u2019s a plus when it comes to tech and innovation. It\u2019s a minus when it comes to the speed of central agreement as well as the potential for abuse. Email never quite recovered from the open nature of inputs, which meant that spammers, scammers and hustlers could do what they liked, and the defense was imperfect filters.\nThe intentional decentralization of the Mastodon federation seems designed to make those filters more natural and effective, at the expense of a super loud amplifier in the middle. You candiscovernew voices and ideas, but there isn\u2019t a megaphone at work, just begging to be hacked by selfish behavior. It\u2019s a bit more like life and a bit less like traditional social networks that create controversy to earn a profit.\nAnd finally\u2013the culture of this federation is still being created. A lot of the folks who just arrived will be the authors of that culture, and if they figure out how to be generous and kind, that\u2019s what will get built. Alas, as is often the case, culture is up to us, particularly when the commercial bias is removed.\nI\u2019m reposting my daily bloghere, and might dip in from time to time, and I\u2019m eager to see how this peer to peer experiment unfolds.\nIf you\u2019re a developer with chops in APIs, apps, and what\u2019s happening in the Mastodon world, I\u2019d love to hear from you for some future projects I\u2019m noodling on.

Hit movies and books stayed on the bestseller lists for months or even years (!)\nToday, an internet video or an investment philosophy or a political moment might last for weeks or even a few days. It's not unusual for a movie or a book or even a TV series to come and go before most people notice it. Neophilia has fundamentally changed the culture.\nThe result is that there's an increasing desire, almost a panic, for something new. Yesterday was a million years ago, and tomorrow is already here. The rush for new continues to increase, and it is now surpassing our ability to satisfy it.\nWhen that need can't be filled (which is not surprising, if you think about it) then we're inclined to declare that it's the end, the end of new ideas, the end of progress, the end of everything that's interesting.

A job where you need someone to perform a measurable task and to follow instructions. This can range from stuffing envelopes to performing blood tests. It\u2019s a profitable task if the person is productive, and you need to find a reliable, skilled person to do what you need.\nThe second kind of job requires insight and creativity. This job relies on someone doing something you could never imagine in advance, producing outcomes better than you had hoped for. This might include a sales job, or someone rearranging the factory floor to increase productivity. It could also include a skilled craftsperson or even a particularly skilled receptionist.\nIf you\u2019re hiring for the first kind of job, exactly why are you sitting a nervous candidate down in your office and asking her to put on some sort of demonstration in her ability to interact with strangers under pressure? Why do you care what his suit looks like or whether or not he can look you in the eye?\nYears ago, in order to keep the ethnic balance at Harvard the way some trustees felt was correct, the school created interviews and essays as a not-so-subtle way to weed out the undesirables. This spread to just about every college in the country, and persists to this day, even though it\u2019s a largely discredited way to determine anything. Your company is probably doing exactly the same thing. If someone can do the cog job, what other information are you looking for? Why?\nAnd if you\u2019re hiring for the second kind of job, the question becomes even more interesting. Would you marry someone based on a one hour interview in a singles bar? And how does repeating the forced awkwardness of an interview across your entire team help you choose which people are going to dothe extraordinary work you\u2019re banking on?\nI\u2019ve been to thousands of job interviews (thankfully as an interviewer mostly) and I have come to the conclusion that the entire effort is a waste of time.\nAt least half the interview finds the interviewer giving an unplanned and not very good overview of what the applicant should expect from this job. Unlike most of the marketing communications the organization does, this spiel is unvetted, unnatural and unmeasured. No one has ever sat down and said, \u201cwhen we say X, is it likely the applicant understands what we mean? Are we putting our best foot forward? Does it make it more likely that the right people will want to work here, for the right reasons?\u201d [tell the truth, do you test your job interview spiel the same way you test your web results or even your direct mail?]\nThe other half is dedicated to figuring out whether the applicant is good at job interviews or not.\nI should have learned this lesson in 1981, when my partner and I (and three of our managers) hired Susan, who was perhaps the best interviewer I have ever met. And one of the worst employees we ever hired. Too bad we didn\u2019t have a division that sold interviews.\nLet me be clear about what I\u2019m recommending: the next time someone asks you to \u201csit in\u201d on an interview, just say no. Don\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t waste your time or theirs.\nSo, what should you do instead?\nGlad you asked!\nFirst, none of this will work if you\u2019re not offering a great job at a great company for fair pay. These techniques will not succeed if you are the employer of last resort. Assuming that\u2019s not the case, how about his:\nEvery applicant gets a guided tour of your story. Maybe from a website or lens or DVD. Maybe from one person in your organization who is really good at this. It might mean a plant tour or watching an interview with the CEO. It might involve spending an hour sitting in one of your stores or following one of your doctors around on her rounds. But it\u2019s a measurable event, something you can evaluate after the process is over. If you\u2019re hiring more than a few people a week, clearly it\u2019s worth having a full-time person to do this task and do it well.\nThere are noone-on-one-sit-in-my-office-and-let\u2019s-talkinterviews. Boom, you just saved 7 hours per interview. Instead, spend those seven hours actually doing the work. Put the person on a team and have a brainstorming session, or design a widget or make some espressos together. If you want to hire a copywriter, do some copywriting. Send back some edits and see how they\u2019re received.\nIf the person is really great, hire them. For a weekend. Pay them to spend another 20 hours pushing their way through something. Get them involved with the people they\u2019ll actually be working with and find out how it goes. Not just the outcomes, but the process. Does their behavior and insight change the game for the better? If they want to be in sales, go on a sales call with them. Not a trial run, but a real one. If they want to be a rabbi, have them give a sermon or visit a hospital.\nYes, people change after you hire them. They always do. But do they change more after an unrealistic office interview or after you\u2019ve actually watched them get in the cage and tame a lion?"}]}

Simple typography for non-professionals\nBlog: Setting type used to have just one function: is it readable? Then, to save money, a new question: Can we get a lot of words on a page?\nThe third question, though, is the most dominant for most people making a presentation, designing a website, scoping out a logo or otherwise using type to deliver a message:How does it look?\nThe answer is not absolute. In some situations, some cultures, some usages, one type looks fine and another looks garish or silly or just wrong. And the reason is that whether we realize it or not, type reminds us of something we've seen before.\nHere's an obvious example that I found floating around online:\n\nHere's another example\u2026 which one looks like a college you'd aspire to attend:\n\nIf you use a typeface that reminds me of the script on the menu of a French restaurant, then no, I'm not going to instinctively believe that you're a good doctor. If you use a thin, elegant wedding invitation font in your Powerpoint presentation, you haven't been clever, you've merely confused me.\nHere's the amateur's rule of thumb:don't call attention to your typeface choices unless you want the typeface to speak for you. Instead, start with the look and feel of the industry leaders and go from there. The shortcut that I learned from design pioneer (and the world's first desktop publisher)John McWade: Use Franklin Gothic Condensed for your headlines and Garamond for your body copy. Change it if you want, but only when you want to remind me of something.\n[And this is where the hard part shows up: by 'industry leader' I don't mean the company that makes the most profit. I mean the voice that has the most authority, that raises the bar, that is well dressed. And that means learning how to see. Do you see how the New York subway system uses typography that feels more confident and clear than a typical amusement park's signage? Until you see the difference, keep your hands away from the keyboard\u2026]\nTypography in your work isn't for you. It doesn't matter if you like it. It doesn't matter if the committee likes it. After legibility, all that matters is what the recipient is reminded of. (And yes, it's fine if the typography reminds your viewer of nothing at all, at least if your goal is to create the awe of the totally new).\nIf you use the standard Microsoft font in your Powerpoint presentation, it might be common, but it won't be powerful. If you use Comic Sans, it won't be common, but it won't be powerful either.\nIt's a bit like wearing a dark blue suit to a meeting with a banker. You can wear something else, sure, but make sure you want it to be noticed, because it will be.\nAnd here's a bonus advanced idea fromXKCD.\nProfessionals and those with a budget to hire one, feel free to ignore some of this. If you ask for attention to be paid to your typography, though, you need to own the outcome of that attention."}]}

There\u2019s plenty of evidence that intervention can shorten it, and also indications that overdoing a response to it is a waste or even harmful.\nThe other recession, though, the one with the loss of \u201cgood factory jobs\u201d and systemic unemployment\u2013I fear that this recession is here forever.\nWhy do we believe that jobs where we are paid really good money to do work that can be systemized, written in a manual and/or exported are going to come backever? The internet has squeezed inefficiencies out of many systems, and the ability to move work around, coordinate activity and digitize data all combine to eliminate a wide swath of the jobs the industrial age created.\nThere\u2019s a race to the bottom, one where communities fight to suspend labor and environmental rules in order to become the world\u2019s cheapest supplier. The problem with the race to the bottom is that you might win\u2026\nFactories were at the center of the industrial age. Buildings where workers came together to efficiently craft cars, pottery, insurance policies and organ transplants\u2013these are job-centric activities, places where local inefficiencies are trumped by the gains from mass production and interchangeable parts. If local labor costs the industrialist more, he has to pay it, because what choice does he have?\nNo longer. If it can be systemized, it will be. If the pressured middleman can find a cheaper source, she will. If the unaffiliated consumer can save a nickel by clicking over here or over there, then that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen.\nIt was the inefficiency caused by geography that permitted local workers to earn a better wage, and it was the inefficiency of imperfect communication that allowed companies to charge higher prices.\nThe industrial age, the one that started with the industrial revolution, is fading away. It is no longer the growth engine of the economy and it seems absurd to imagine that great pay for replaceable work is on the horizon.\nThis represents a significant discontinuity, a life-changing disappointment for hard-working people who are hoping for stability but are unlikely to get it. It\u2019s a recession, the recession of a hundred years of the growth of the industrial complex.\nI\u2019m not a pessimist, though, because the new revolution, the revolution of connection, creates all sorts of new productivity and new opportunities. Not for repetitive factory work, though, not for the sort of thing ADP measures. Most of the wealth created by this revolution doesn\u2019t look like a job, not a full time one anyway.\nWhen everyone has a laptop and connection to the world, then everyone owns a factory. Instead of coming together physically, we have the ability to come together virtually, to earn attention, to connect labor and resources, to deliver value.\nStressful? Of course it is. No one is trained in how to do this, in how to initiate, to visualize, to solve interesting problems and then deliver. Some see the new work as a hodgepodge of little projects, a pale imitation of a \u2018real\u2019 job. Others realize that this is a platform for a kind of art, a far more level playing field in which owning a factory isn\u2019t a birthright for a tiny minority but something that hundreds of millions of people have the chance to do.\nGears are going to be shifted regardless. In one direction is lowered expectations and plenty of burger flipping\u2026 in the other is a race to the top, in which individuals who are awaiting instructions begin to give them instead.\nThe future feels a lot more like marketing\u2013it\u2019s impromptu, it\u2019s based on innovation and inspiration, and it involves connections between and among people\u2013and a lot less like factory work, in which you do what you did yesterday, but faster and cheaper.\nThis means we may need to change our expectations, change our training and change how we engage with the future. Still, it\u2019s better than fighting for a status quo that is no longer. The good news is clear: every forever recession is followed by a lifetime of growth from the next thing\u2026\nJob creation is a false idol. The future is about gigs and assets and art and an ever-shifting series of partnerships and projects. It will change the fabric of our society along the way. No one is demanding that welikethe change, but the sooner we see it and set out to become an irreplaceable linchpin, the faster the pain will fade, as we get down to the work that needs to be (and now can be) done.\nThis revolution is at least as big as the last one, and the last one changed everything."}]}

When you announce things based on optimism, the rest of the world you're engaging with builds plans around you and your announcement. And the cost of the person who doesn't have your software or is sitting around a meeting room for hours waiting is high indeed.\nThe alternative is honest time. Time without recourse or negotiation. The Metro North train leaves at 5:52. Not 5:55, no matter how much you want it to wait.\nThe software ships, the conference starts\u2013at precisely when we say it will. So the world plans on it and depends on it and effectiveness grows.\nIt doesn't ship because it's ready. It ships because it's due.\n(Amazingly, this rule makes things ready a lot more often).\nIt's a point of view and a contract with yourself. It ships when I said it would."}]}

A station, particularly an express stop, would lead to more residents, then more businesses, then more investment in schools, then a bigger station, an entire ecosystem based on one early choice.\nThe internet is no different. Decisions at the center change everything around the edges, for all of us.\nAaron Wall has been blogging about Google\u2019s power for years, andhis latest postmakes an insightful connection:\nSome of the more hated aspects of online publishing (headline bait, idiotic correlations out of context, pagination, slideshows, popups, fly in ad units, auto play videos, \u2026 etc.) arenot done because online publishers want to be jackasses, but because it is hard to make the numbers work in a competitive environment.\nEver since the first commercial website (GNN) was launched byTim,DaleandLisa, the model has been the same: earn free traffic and monetize it with ads.\nThere are two parts to this equation: traffic and ads.\nGoogle (the source of so much traffic) is under huge pressure from Wall Street to deliver increased profits, and until self-driving cars kick in, the largest share of those earnings is going to come from the ads they sell. To maximize their profit, Google has spent the last nine years aggressively working to increase the share ofadson each page in their search results, as well as working hard to keep as many clicks as they can within the Google ecosystem.\nIf you want traffic, Google\u2019s arc makes clear to publishers, you\u2019re going to have to pay for it.\nWhich is their right, of course, but that means that the ad tactics on every other site have to get ever more aggressive, because search traffic is harder to earn with good content. And even more germane to my headline, it means that content publishers are moving toward social and viral traffic, because they can no longer count on search to work for them.It\u2019s this addiction to social that makes the web dumber.If you want tonnage, lower your standards.\nGoogle\u2019s original breakthrough model for indexing the web was realizing the power of thelink. Great content earned more links, more links got a higher ranking, and there was an incentive to create more great content. This was an extraordinary virtuous cycle, the one that opened the door for quality content online.\nIt was Google\u2019s decision to send people away from the site (compared to Yahoo, which decided to keep people on the site) that led Google\u2019s growth. People came to Google hoping to leave Google to find something worth clicking on, and media companies eagerly worked to make content that would give them something to read. We've always counted on a media arbiter to raise the bar of our culture.\nThe gaming of the SEO system combined with the power of first page results (virtually all search clicks come to those on the first page of results) combined with Google's shift to controlling as much as possible of the unpaid clickstream means that this paradigm is no longer what it was.\nThat means that a thoughtful, well-written onlinemagazinehas a harder time being discovered by someone who might be searching for it, which makes it harder to scale.\nIf you\u2019re a content provider, the shift to mobile, and to social and the shift in Google\u2019s priorities mean that it\u2019s worth a very hard look at how you\u2019ll monetize and the value of permission (i.e. thesubscribersto this blog are its backbone). And if you\u2019re Google, it\u2019s worth comparing the short-term upside of strangling the best (thoughtful, personal, informed) content to the long-term benefit of creating a healthy ecosystem.\nHere's the key question: Are the people who are making great content online doing itdespitethe search regime, or enabled by it?\nFor the first ten years of the web, the answer was obvious. I'm not sure it is any longer.\nAnd if you're still reading this long post, if you're one of the billions of people who rely on the free content that's shared widely, it's worth thinking hard about whether the center of that content universe is pushing the library you rely on to get dumb, fast."}]}

Many workers preferred a reliable regular paycheck, and owners decided to profit by investing in productivity and keeping the upside. When new machines show up, the workers don\u2019t get paid more, but the boss makes more.\nNow, as work-from-home promises/threatens to become a norm for many knowledge workers, the question is back.\nSome bosses are demanding workers return to the office, and some managers have spent the last year forcing people to endure endless zoom meetings. The mindset seems to be that if your time is what got purchased, the boss wants to be sure you\u2019re spending all of that time at work on work, not, who knows, tending for an ill family member or something.\nBut as it gets easier to measure productivity and contribution, and as it gets easier to outsource any task that can be described clearly, there\u2019s a fork in the road:\nIf we\u2019re not buying or selling hours, what, exactly do we measure and how are we compensated for it? Are workers ready or open to getting a commission, a profit-share or a per-piece price? And if we\u2019re not selling our time but our contribution, does that further self-center the culture?\nAnd if we are buying and selling hours, how does that work when surveillance capitalism bumps into workers needing flexible schedules and the trust that it takes to develop leadership and creative contribution?\nIs it okay with you, the boss, if one of your workers dramatically increases productivity through some outsourcing or tech shortcuts on their own nickel and then goes home at 2 pm every day?\nIs it okay if you have another worker who works until midnight every night but doesn\u2019t get nearly as much done?\nWhat about a team of five deciding to skip most of their meetings, coordinate through a shared doc and put the time they save into going for a walk or thinking about the next breakthrough?\nIf it\u2019s truly about what we produce, how many people on the team are aware of how much they produce? What would happen if they were?\nThe theory of the firm was based on two key assumptions: That workers needed to be in physical proximity to each other, and that communicating with and measuring outsiders was simply too expensive to scale.

(and then brag about it!) Maybe I'm getting cranky, but the relentless march of marketers into our lives is really getting to me.

This is my attention, not yours, and if you want to use it for a while, please earn the privilege.\nPS If I ran Twitter, I'd build my new ad service about a socially acceptable way for corporate users to build large lists of followers, people who would give permission to get news and discounts and insights from advertisers.

In fact, it would be weird if we heard of someone on stage or on the field who didn\u2019t have one.\nAnd yet, in the world of business, they\u2019re seen as the exception.\nPart of the reason is that work feels like an extension of something we\u2019ve been doing our whole lives. Figure skating isn\u2019t like school, but showing up at work seems to be. \u201cI\u2019ve got this,\u201d is a badge of honor.\nAnd part of the reason is that a few coaches have made claims that stretch belief, and we\u2019re not actually sure what they do. It doesn\u2019t help that there\u2019s no easy way to identify what sort of coach we need or what we\u2019re going to get\u2026\nIt turns out that the people with the potential to benefit the most from a coach are often the most hesitant precisely because of what coaching involves.\nTalking about our challenges. Setting goals. Acknowledging that we can get better. Eagerly seeking responsibility\u2026\nAnd yet we avert our eyes and hesitate. It might be because having a coach might be interpreted as a sign of weakness. And what if we acknowledge our challenges but fail to overcome them? It could be that we don\u2019t want to cause change to happen, or that we\u2019re worried that we will.\nOne company I admire believes in coaches so much that they\u2019ve put several on staff, ensuring that their leadership all benefit from one. But mostly, it\u2019s something we have to pay for ourselves.\nAnd so, paying for a coach, for something that\u2019s hard to measure, which might be socially awkward, to get better at something that feels normal\u2014combine that with a hesitancy to ask for help\u2014it\u2019s a wonder anyone has a coach.\nThe paradox is that the very things that hold us back are the reasons we need a coach in the first place.\n[Email subscribers!

This would further divide those with a head start from everyone else. Wiring the schools in the US was one response to the threat of this divide.\nI think anewdivide has opened up, one that is based far more onchoicethan on circumstance. Several million people (and the number is growing, daily) have chosen to become the haves of the Internet, and at the same time that their number is growing, so are their skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes it surprise you that more thanhalfof the hundreds of thousands ofBoing Boingreaders use Firefox? That\u2019s about five times the number you\u2019d expect. It turns out that a lot of these tech-friendly behaviors come in bunches. Someone who has a few of these behaviors is likely to have most of them. (and no, this is by no means a complete list. I\u2019m sure the blog community will find twenty others and post them in a day or two!)\nSo what? Why should you care if a bunch of nerds are learning a lot of cool new stuff?\nWell, five years ago, geeks pretty much kept to themselves. They\u2019d be sitting in IRC chat, or arguing about Unix vs. Linux, but it didn\u2019t spread very fast and it didn\u2019t influence the rest of the world outside the tech community.\nToday, though, the Net is far more robust and far more ubiquitous than it used to be. And it\u2019s bloggers who are setting the agenda on everything from politics to culture. It\u2019s bloggers that journalists and politicians look to as the first and the loudest.\nAs a result, your most-connected, most influential customers are part of the digerati. They can make or break your product, your service or even your religion\u2019s new policies. Because the Net is now a broadcast (and a narrowcast) medium, the digerati can spread ideas.\nThe second thing to keep in mind is that the digerati are using the learning tools built into the Net to get smarter, faster. A new Net tool can propogate to millions in just a week or two. Unlike the old digital divide, this means that the divide between the digerati and the rest of the world is accelerating.\nSo, it\u2019s choice time. Several of my colleagues (tompeters!being a notable example) are jumping in with both feet. Others take a look at the headstart and decide that it\u2019s just too much work.\nTry to imagine doing your work today without email. It\u2019s inconceivable. I think the tools of the digerati are going to be just as essential in just a moment or two. You can wait until Microsoft issues them all as a dumbed down package, but if you do, you\u2019ll not only miss the texture and understanding that comes from learning as you go, but you\u2019ll always be trying to catch up.\nI can\u2019t decide if I\u2019m really anusor athem.I\u2019ve got all the tools above, but it\u2019s still hard work. The good news, though, is that you won\u2019t break anything if you try these new tools and commit yourself to understanding the new digerati. Better hurry, though, because they won\u2019t wait for you."}]}

Sometimes by evil spammers that send texts pretending to know you, \u201cwant to play golf tomorrow?\u201d or \u201cyour wife said you were selling your house\u2026\u201d. And sometimes by people who aren\u2019t evil at all, but simply have a different sense of the medium than you do.\nAnd so here\u2019s a text in which 15 people are cc\u2019ed. You don\u2019t know most of them, so all you see is their phone numbers. And it requires you to stop what you\u2019re doing and open your calendar and calculate whether that day is free or not. And whether the people you hope to interact with are going or not. And of course, if anyone hits reply, everyone gets the reply. And of course, one of those people then decides to \u2018get the word out\u2019 and tell everyone else on the thread about their unrelated garage sale, coming up in just a few days\u2026\nPretty soon, your pocket vibrates enough with both kinds of texts often enough that you simply don\u2019t prioritize checking, and then, the next time an urgent text comes along, well, it\u2019s ignored.\nTexting is first come next served. There\u2019s no nuance to it, no priority list, nothing but \u2018I read it\u2019 or \u2018I didn\u2019t.\u2019\nThe asymmetry of the dynamic here sows the seeds of the demise. It\u2019s up to every single person you know to protect your attention, up to each of them to be generous and discreet and not waste your time. And the cost of them simply doing what everyone else is doing is so low that the whole thing begins to degrade.\nAdd to that the ease with which telemarketers and spammers can now weaponize your initial contact (14 notes about one dinner reservation!) and you can see how the path only goes one way.\nThe magic of widespread media like the telephone, email and texts is that it\u2019s an open API. No one is actually in charge of the inputs, but this is also the problem.\nI\u2019m hopeful that services liketexts.comor even the folks in Cupertino will take a deep breath and create a protected tier for useful interactions that actually have permission. The structure of the interface determines the utility of the system. If it\u2019s easy to cc 15 strangers, people will.\nIn 1994, I led a team that invented games you could play by text. It almost turned into a killer idea, and maybe it\u2019ll be back one day.\nAnd in 1999, I tried to coordinate the work around buying cheap stamps for email, so that the API might be slowed and focused a bit.\nPerhaps AI will start being an (imperfect) filter, but the problem is so hard to solve after the fact, I\u2019m not optimistic.\nThe rule is pretty simple:bad noise crowds out good signalin just about any useful communications medium. The opportunity is to design against bad noise and to be vigilant about maintaining the magic that made it useful in the first place."}]}

Instead, they're pointing out that shortcuts are rarely dependable (or particularly short) and that instead, perhaps, you should follow the longer, more deliberate, less magical path if you truly want to succeed.\nIf your business or your music or your art or your project is truly worth your energy and your passion, then don't sell it short by putting its future into a lottery ticket.\nHere's another way to think about it: delight the audience you already have, amaze the customers you can already reach, dazzle the small investors who already trust you enough to listen to you. Take the permission you have and work your way up. Leaps look good in the movies, but in fact, success is mostly about finding a path and walking it one step at a time."}]}

It\u2019s the accidental outcome that comes from trying to emulate an organization that\u2019s focused on its mediocrity.\nThe mechanization and industrialization of cottage industries (like hotels, restaurants and healthcare) has led to a convenient homogenization for many. It means you can travel around the world and find better than decent accommodations and safe food, all at a fair price.\nBut it also means that most of the people working in these entities are treated like interchangeable cogs. They have no say at all about how things are done (or at least feel that way) and so they\u2019ve emotionally checked out. It\u2019s easier that way.\nThe products and services revert to the mean, sucking the humanity out of not just the people who work there, but from the interactions the customers have as well.\nIf you have a lousy meal at a real restaurant, the owner could hear from you and, it\u2019s likely, not only fix it, but get back to you. Have a lousy experience with a Host, a Taco Bell, or a JW Marriott, though, and the odds are that the individual who reads your review has never even visited the place you\u2019re talking about, and certainly doesn\u2019t care enough to do anything about it.\nOne of the promises of the worldwide behemoth corporation was that reliability and quality was assured. The downside is that the chances that an internal insurgent can make things better go down.\nAs we see so many organizations seek to emulate the scale, influence and profits of the Fortune 100, it\u2019s worth remembering that uncaring mediocrity shouldn\u2019t be a north star.\nFocused mediocrityis different. It\u2019s intentional. It\u2019s the act of chasing the banal, so that the largest possible number of people will be satisfied enough not to complain. This is the sieve of deliverability and the sword of mass.\nThe third kind of mediocrity happens when someone isuninformed. When they\u2019re too busy or too lazy to pay attention to the taste of those they seek to serve or they don\u2019t care enough to deliver it with quality and humanity.\nAt least have the guts to be mediocre on purpose."}]}

If we didn't, marketing wouldn't work nearly as well.\nOur brains are busy processing chemicals that internally change our moods, but find a way to rationalize those mood changes based on events and purchases in the outside world. We often act as though money can buy joy, but of course, it works better when we're joyful in the first place.\nWe don't say, \"I'm genetically pre-disposed to mild depression,\" or \"I haven't exercised in a while and I spend a lot of time watching TV,\" instead, we say, \"I'm disappointed because I don't make enough money and my boss is mean to me.\" And yet, someone in the very same circumstances seems much happier than we are. And somehow, nothing ever happens in our career that makes everything all right forever.\nWe don't say, \"I'm grouchy because of hormones.\" Instead, we say, \"He deserved that outburst. He was being a jerk.\" Of course, he was the same guy last week and you sort of liked him.\nWe don't say, \"When I dress and act like the people around me, I can feel safe as a member of their tribe.\" Instead, we think, \"I feel good when I'm with my friends.\"\nWe don't say, \"I have a very complex relationship with money because my parents spoiled me.\" Instead, we say, \"Hey, the bankgaveme a credit card so it's okay to buy things that I deserve.\"\nWe don't say, \"I eat to drown out the way I feel about my mom,\" instead we say, \"Hey, if it's on a salad bar, it must be good for me. And anyway, next month is my birthday.\"\nThe external world is remarkably consistent, and yet we blame it for what's going on inside of us. People who think the world is going to end always manage to find a new thing that's going to cause it to end. People itching to be bummed out all day long will certainly find an external event that give their emotion some causal cover. The thinking happens long before the event that we blame the thinking on.\nProducts are remarkably similar, yet we use their marketing stories as an extension of our self-image and self-esteem. Should a new phone really make you that happy?\nColleagues are almost always trying to work with us, yet it's easy to blame them when anxiety about other events triggers time-honored patterns in our behavior.\nHang out at the mall two weeks before the prom. Can those items on the rack really pacify the raging anxieties of the teenagers waiting to buy them (or is the social triggers that do it)? Watch McKinsey doing a multimillion dollar consulting gig for a Fortune 500 company. Are they really telling the board something that couldn't have been discovered by a few talented folks in the finance department? Or are they paying for peace of mind?\nMarketers spend billions of dollars identifying common biochemical events, and then they launch products and services with stories that align with those events. As a result, we spend money on external forces in an attempt to heal internal pain. Marketers want the equation to be, \"if you buy this, everything will be all right.\"\nI wish it were so easy."}]}

I cleaned up some of the formatting from their website so you can read it more clearly. Nobody ever said I\u2019m afraid of hyberbole.\nConsumers know marketers are liars\u2019THE SETH GODIN INTERVIEW / MALIKA RODRIGUESTIMES NEWS NETWORK[ WEDNESDAY, JUNE 04, 2003 01:34:49 AM ]\nHe once said that he wished he had invented Hotmail. Small wonder then that he\u2019s dubbed the \u201cthe ultimate entrepreneur for the Information Age\u201d \u2014 meet one of marketing world\u2019s greatest minds, Seth Godin. Alan Webber, founding editor of Fast Company, says, \u201cWhatever Seth is selling is catching \u2014 and if you spend time with him, you\u2019ll come down with it.\u201d In an interview with Brand Equity, legendary marketing man Sergio Zyman (of Coca-Cola fame), told us that he\u2019d recommend any of Godin\u2019s books \u2014 \u201cHe always makes you think.\u201d\nThink again. Godin\u2019s best-seller, Permission Marketing, was named one of Fortune magazine\u2019s best business books in 1999. Godin\u2019s made the bestseller lists time and again \u2014 some of his other blockbusters include Survival Is Not Enough and, more recently, Unleashing The Ideavirus. In the preface to that book, author of The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell warned: \u201cThis is a subversive book. It says that the marketer is not \u2013and ought not to be \u2014 at the centre of successful marketing. The customer should be. Are you ready for that?\u201d\nAnd are you ready for the Godin magic? Here\u2019s more: In his latest book Purple Cow, Godin describes how having an idea that\u2019s \u201cremarkable\u201d is the only way a brand can survive. He looks at companies that do that \u2014 those that have invented the Purple Cow, and how they\u2019ve been able to milk them.\nNow meet Godin, the fiery entrepreneur. He was founder of Yoyodyne, the first gaming and interactive direct marketing site on the Internet, which was acquired by Yahoo! in 1998. He then joined Yahoo! as vice-president of direct marketing before leaving in 2000 for a career devoted to writing and speaking. And if you think we haven\u2019t given you the full picture, well, he likes it that way.\nIn a candid and free-wheeling chat with Brand Equity from the outskirts of New York, Godin talks about what makes companies remarkable, the biggest challenges marketers have to face, and how brands can deal with growing clutter, and consumers who are increasingly cutting off communication with them. Watch out for the second installment of the interview next week as well.\nYou\u2019ve written about the need for marketing to be a part of every process a company does. How does one go about building that sort of total marketing mindset?\nIf you\u2019re going to be busy just buying TV ads, you can have the company make anything it wants and then the marketing department has to come up with a very clever advertising campaign. That doesn\u2019t work any more. You have to build the marketing right into the product. The people who are going to make a product successful are the people who invent it, not the people who market it.\nLook at a company like Starbucks, they don\u2019t spend any time at all on marketing, but they spend an enormous amount of time on the quality of the coffee beans, the lighting in the stores\u2026 Because those things make the store remarkable. I saw a bunch of TV commercials that ESPN had run about two years ago in India, they were very funny. But they didn\u2019t work. And they didn\u2019t work because what they were promoting wasn\u2019t on television \u2014 the commercials were funny, but the TV shows weren\u2019t.\nHow does a brand like Starbucks keep reinventing itself?\nThey did something interesting last year, which is that they wired one thousand of their stores with wireless Internet connections. So for people like me, and I\u2019m in the minority, I would go across an entire town to sit in a Starbucks for five minutes and check my email. And I\u2019d tell hundreds of people about this, because it changes the way I work when I\u2019m on the road. So that was one remarkable thing they did, instead of doing more of the same. But the big challenge they\u2019re going to have, is there are only so many three-dollar cappuccinos a person can drink everyday. And I think they have to embrace the fact that Starbucks isn\u2019t going to keep growing the way it was, and they\u2019re going to have to find something new \u2014 maybe in the same building, maybe not \u2014 that is remarkable all over again.\nAre there any common characteristics to all these remarkable companies?\nWhat they all have in common is that they have nothing in common. What they all have in common is that they\u2019re going to the edges. The mindset, all over the world is \u201cLet\u2019s make average products for average people\u201d. Everywhere you go, that\u2019s what it\u2019s always about. Average people are now really good at ignoring marketers; they don\u2019t pay attention any more. So, it\u2019s now about how can I make the things on the fringe, that most people don\u2019t want. If you make the things that most people don\u2019t want, you may find that some people desperately want them.\nConsumers today are bombarded by clutter not just in advertising messages, but with news, with terror alerts, with rumours\u2026 How are marketers reacting to this clutter?\nThey\u2019re doing exactly the wrong thing: they\u2019re running more ads. They\u2019re putting ads on parking meters, in hotel elevators, in washrooms. Because they think that the answer to clutter is more clutter. That\u2019s why there\u2019s so much spam in your email box. Because marketers are desperate.\nConsumers have realised that marketers are lying scum. They don\u2019t trust them to give them permission (to talk to them) anymore, because they figure that the permission is going to get stolen. And so there are some people who are able to build a reputation,?  and they can get permission. I signed up 500 people in the last three days for my newsletter, because people know I\u2019m not going to steal it. But there\u2019s no way in the world anyone\u2019s giving their email ID to Allstate Insurance, because the next thing they know they\u2019re going to get deluged with spam.\nSo how do marketers deal with a situation when they\u2019re getting less and less access to consumers? For instance, schools in the US are banning the sales of soft drinks on campuses\u2026\nStop lying, stop cheating, and stop insisting that every single person in the world drink Coca-Cola ten times a day. Consumers have the right to keep Coca-Cola out of the elementary schools. Coca-Cola does not have the right to sell it there. And the right thing for Coke to do is not sue people to get into the schools, but invent a new product, a healthy product, a remarkable product that makes consumers\u2019 lives actually better, and wait for people to say we\u2019d like to sell it in schools. And they could do that, they just have to acknowledge the fact that Coke\u2019s not going to grow the way it used to.\nLowe in the UK recently launched a channel that will show only commercials\u2026 What do you think?\nThe Lowe thing is a stunt. It\u2019s remarkable that there could be a channel with only not-very-good commercials on it. But there\u2019s no question that in a world when you could have a billion TV channels, you could have a channel that has nothing but a half hour commercial about Volvo cars. Because if you\u2019re thinking about buying a Volvo, you\u2019re going to want to watch that half-hour presentation. Not a slick, one-minute, sexy commercial, but a half-hour honest representation of what their car can do. And so that\u2019s a commercial, but it doesn\u2019t interrupt the person who doesn\u2019t want to see it.\nIn a more slick way, BMW did it with those movies. There are plenty of places like Charles Schwab where you can go into one of their investment centres, and the salesperson won\u2019t bother you, you can sit and read a brochure that honestly tells you whether you should go in for this or that.\nAre marketers building an age of mega-events as far as conventional advertising goes \u2014 like the Super Bowl?\nThe Super Bowl is the last refuge of the interruption marketer. It\u2019s the only place where people with tons of money can interrupt large numbers of unaggregated, average people, who aren\u2019t really paying attention. So it\u2019s a great place for someone with nothing better to do to spend money. It\u2019s not going to go away until they stop spending the money, so I expect it\u2019s going to be around for quite a while. But the fact is that there are very few, maybe no companies, that have advertised on the Super Bowl and said, we can prove that it was a good idea.\nReebok seems to think so with its Terry Tate commercial this year\u2026\nThe thing is, the Terry Tate commercial (even though I don\u2019t own a television, I saw it!) was for a commercial, really effective, and it helped them do better against Nike that week. But that\u2019s not going to make Reebok work. The only thing that can is for Reebok to figure out on an ongoing basis, how to make a profit selling sneakers to people. And you can\u2019t keep repeating a Terry Tate sort of experience. They\u2019re not going to say the future of Reebok is to run lots of commercials on the Super Bowl, \u2014 that\u2019s not why it works. Why it worked is that in a sea of really bad commercials, it was better.\nI think both Reebok and Nike are trying interesting things. Both have management who realise that it\u2019s not going to be about TV ads in the future. And so Nike, which has a long history of bringing out a new product every few days, is getting more aggressive about bringing out interesting, edgy, new products that are remarkable. Reebok, which has a tradition of not being so much a bully as Nike is going to win because they may be able to deal with consumers in a way that will keep them happy."}]}

Modern industrialism has embraced the extraordinary power of instant gratification and has amplified it by reminding us that onlyyouknow what you want and need.\nFast food plus the me generation. What you want, when you want it.\nYears ago, I co-authored apaperthat, if implemented would probably have solved our shameful shortage of available organs for donation. In prioritizing people who need a donation, we\u2019d settle a tie by sorting people by how long they\u2019d been on the donor registry. If you\u2019re not willing to sign up to give (one day far in the future) then you don\u2019t get priority to get (when you need it). The self-focused need to be on the list early would essentially eliminate the need for a ranking at all, because humans have been taught to do what helps them now before worrying about later or everyone else. Enough people would panic and race to be on the registry that the shortage would soon disappear.\nIn our culture, turning the \u201cus and later\u201d narrative (you should sign up for the registry to help a stranger one day) into \u201cme and now\u201d (better sign up today or you\u2019ll regret it) is a generous hack. We shouldn\u2019t have to do it, it\u2019s less resilient, but it would work.\nHow then, did the media respond to public health officials to flatten the curve on the epidemic virus (not perfectly, not soon enough, but they did)? They didn\u2019t appeal to, \u201cyou should do this to protect strangers from getting sick.\u201d They tried but it didn\u2019t work well enough.\nThey did it by implying, \u201cif you touch someone, you will die almost instantly and quite horribly.\u201d And people, already frightened, embraced the feeling.\nPeople generally aren\u2019t wearing masks and socially distancing out of long-term philanthropy and insight about resources and epidemiology. It\u2019s happening because of the panic of self-preservation.\nA rational, generous, community mindset was effectively replaced by an immediate and self-focused desire to be safe. A generous hack.\nThe selfish dolts onspring breakor inbouncycastles didn\u2019t get that memo: they feel fine, why bother being careful?\nA narrative of \u201csave yourself right now\u2019 is effective in this culture. In other cultures, less industrialized but hardly less sophisticated, an alternative could be a focus on \u201cus\u201d before \u201cme.\u201d\nWithout a doubt, short-term market needs are often efficiently filled by short-term selfish behavior. Resilience comes from a longer-term and more community-focused outlook.\nThe question is: Once people catch the virus and get through it (as most people will) and recover (as more than 9 out of 10 will), what will replace the selfish panic?\nCultural pressure is the sometimes unseen force that allows us to maintain civility. It helps us decide what to choose.People like us, do things like this.\nAs we face the need to pay for our recovery, for a new and more resilient safety net and for the shifts that our culture demands, will we have to resort to the short-term and the selfish yet again?\nPick your heroes. Whoever you look up to, my hunch is that it\u2019s someone who took a longer and more inclusive view.\nWe can be those heroes."}]}

Smith wrote in with this question aboutUnleashing the Ideavirus: \"I understand the concept of spreading the idea, but how can you control or direct that growth? 'Going viral' is great for fast growth and sharing of your idea, but are there mechanisms to steer it, trim it, shape it, etc.\"\nThe reason that so many people catch a cold every year is that no one is trying to control where it goes. The reason that Wikipedia is so robust is that control is decentralized. The reason that there's a huge disconnect between corporate marketing and ideas that spread is that the culture of contagious ideas is anethema to the command, control and responsibility mindset of the industrial marketer.\nThere's a huge difference between, \"I want people to talk about this,\" and \"I want to control what people say.\"\nBut, and it's a huge but, the marketer decides where the virus starts. She decides who the first sneezers will be. She decides on what easy-to-use tools may be made available to the group that she's identified. These decisions go a very long way to determining what happens next.\nNapster and Facebook were both optimized for college students and were intentionally seeded there. Sure, the founders could have picked nursing homes or military academies, but the character and culture of the college campus ensured that not only would these ideas\u00a0 spread, but that they would spread in the desired direction.\nIf you want to spread an idea among policy wonks, don't involve People-magazine style celebrities, or aim for big numbers. Instead, find the hive that matches the group you'd like to be discussing your idea, and (this is the big and) create an idea that not only interests this group, but is easy and fun to spread precisely among this group.\n[When I launched this book, I knew which group I wanted to read it. So I wrote in a tone that appealed to this group, placed a long excerpt inFast Company, which was sort of patient zero for this group, and then gave the book away for free (it's still free online) with explicit instructions to share and email it to people who might become engaged with it.\nNo, I couldn't control what would happen, or where it would go, or what the impact might be, but by picking the 3,000 people who got it first, and then making it easy for this group to share it, it quickly got to over a million readers. This wasn't the fastest way to get to abignumber, but it was the best way to get to therightnumber and kind of people.\nThe temptation is to be big, when the real goal ought to be effective.]\nPS last time I checked, you can get a used copy of the 13-year old edition of the book for apenny. You may notice that I've chosen not to update past blog posts, past books or past websites. That's because each is a testament to when it was written, as opposed to being a constantly updating resource. Even so, I hope these older books can add value and give you perspective.\nPPS Fritz Lieber wrote about the out of control ideavirus in his short story \"Rump-Titty-Titty-Tum-TAH-Tee\"publishedmore than fifty years ago."}]}

(oh, this big customer wants me to cut some key corners) you\u2019re going to get caught.

My bosses at Spinnaker Software gave me a lot of room and I ran with it.\nLast March, Ipostedabout an intern program I was starting.\nI was overwhelmed by the quality of what I got back. (The quantity was expected\u2026 interesting internships are hard to find). I heard from students on most continents, with a huge variety of backgrounds and life experiences. And these people were smart.\nUnable to just pick a PDF or two, I invited the applicants to join a Facebook group I had set up. Then I let them meet each other and hang out online.\nIt was absolutely fascinating. Within a day, the group had divided into four camps:\nWant to guess who I hired? (It was a paid gig and five ended up spending time with me in NY on a somewhat rolling basis). If you\u2019re hiring for people to work online, I can\u2019t imagine not screening people in this way. Thisisthe work, and you can watch people do it for real before you hire them.\nAs I went to send a note to the 150 or so who didn\u2019t make the cut, it felt like a waste. A waste for me, surely, because here were a large number of over-talented, under-employed students facing a boring summer. And for them, too, because I thought some might want a chance to continue the virtual experience.\nSo I started a group on Basecamp and invited the rest of the interns to try an unpaid virtual experience. The idea was that I\u2019d provide a platform and some projects, and they could (if they thought it might be interesting) participate online. No grunt work, just interesting stuff to try. To my amazement, more than sixty took me up on it. The conversations ebbed and flowed, the work got done (or didn\u2019t) but I think everyone learned a lot.\nPart of the deal was that active participants would get a shout out here on the blog. So we\u2019ve put togethera PDF of handmade bios of some of the coolest interns in the program. A shortcut for anyone looking for smart folks from around the world.\nIf I did it again, I\u2019d definitely do it again. I think that smaller, more closely managed projects would probably lead to more productivity, but I also know that when faced with opportunity and freedom, amazing people get stuff done.\nIf you gave this a try, I think it would be a brilliant move, for you and for the people you work with. It\u2019s clear that formal education is failing the smart kids entering our field (not certain what \u2018our field\u2019 is, but you know what I mean). We need to create pathways for students to discover that there\u2019s absolutely nothing holding them back."}]}

He changed the world\u2019s expectations for work. While Ford gets credit for \u201cinventing the assembly line,\u201d his great insight was that he understood the power of productivity.\nFord was a pioneer in highly leveraged, repetitive work, done by relatively untrained workers. A farmer, with little training, could walk into Ford\u2019s factory and become extraordinarily productive in a day or two.\nThis is the cornerstone of our way of life. The backbone of our economy is not brain surgeons and master violinists. It\u2019s in fairly average people doing fairly average work.\nThe focus on productivity wouldn\u2019t be relevant to this discussion except for the second thing Ford did. He decided to pay his workers based on productivity, not replacement value.\u00a0 This was an astonishing breakthrough. When Ford announced the $5 day (more than double the typical salary paid for this level of skill), more than 10,000 people applied for work at Ford the very next day.\nInstead of paying people the lowest amount he\u2019d need to find enough competent workers to fill the plant, he paid them more than he needed to because his systems made them so productive. He challenged his workers to be more productive so that they\u2019d get paid more.\nIt meant that nearly every factory worker at Ford was dramatically overpaid!\u00a0 \u00a0When there\u2019s a line out the door of people waiting to take your job, weird things happen to your head. The combination of repetitive factory work plus high pay for standardized performance led to a very obedient factory floor. People were conditioned to do as they were told, and traded autonomy and craftsmanship for high pay and stability.\nAll of a sudden, we got used to being paid based on our output . We came, over time, to expect to get paid more and more, regardless of how long the line of people eager to take our job was. If productivity went up, profits went up. And the productive workers expected (and got) higher pay, even if there were plenty of replacement workers, eager to work for less.\nThis is the central conceit of our economy. People in productive industries get paid a lot even though they could likely be replaced by someone else working for less money.\nThis is why we\u2019re insecure.\nObedience works fine on the well-organized, standardized factory floor. But what happens when we start using our heads, not our hands, when our collars change from blue to white?\n(Excerpted fromFree Prize Inside)"}]}

As a professionalclown for 18 years and as a business person I feel that your analogy is farfrom accurate. Here\u2019s why:1. I beleive that being called a clown is a great compliment no matter whatyour line of work! It means that you have a sense of humor and aren\u2019t afraidto share it. Your derisive definition of a clown offends what I am and what Ido. I hear your definiton as meaning dumb, ignorant, stupid, etc\u2026Clowns are far from stupid. It takes great intellect to see the humor in allsituations, good and bad. And I have medical benefits!2. Clowns are based on us, but not neccessarily about just what\u2019s wrong withhuman nature, we also like to show what is right about it. We point out whatmay seem obvious. Some people can\u2019t see the forest for the trees. We showthem the trees.3. Clowns do not ignore science. We use many of the basic principles ofscience.

There isno \u201cmagic\u201d that can fit 16 clowns in a car, it\u2019s science, spacial relations!We use cetrifugal and centripital forces, inertia, roatation, revolution,momentum and many other great scientific principles and theories!4. Clowns do not argue with gravity, it is all too real! it challenges us,sure, but it always wins.5. Kodak shouldn\u2019t be called clowns, they should plain and simply be calledblind business people with poor leadership.6. Clown measure their results by audience reaction. Did it make an impact?Did they get what I was tryoing to say? We are philosophers and commentatorson the way we all live our lives.7. Clowns are reality!8. Clowns plan ahead! We spend hundreds of hours practicing and perfectingour craft for the amusement of others. I personally have spent 18 yearsstudying and perfecting my craft and thousands of dollars. That takes carefulplanning!9. For the sake of the squirrel I\u2019d like to mention that if they don\u2019t planahead, then what is the purpose of storing nuts for the winter if not aplan???10. I believe that most humans don\u2019t plan ahead and blindly stumble thru lifelooking for a hand-out.11. Clowns overreact to prove a point. (Remember the trees, some need a goodwhack over the head with a our number three point may be the only one I agreewith.12. If clowns aren\u2019t nice to each other, then waht does that say abouthumanity? we are after all only mirrors of the human condition. the stoogesare just down right stupid. Stan and Ollie are a better example, they arenatural comics, they don\u2019t try to be funny, they are just unaware of theirplight, now THAT\u2019S funny!\nSome of the best working environments I have had were working with other realclowns. We are a team, we care about each other and work together to reach acommon goal: laughter. That sure beats any other business goal I can think of.\nI think issuing red noses is a great idea! it would lighten things up andmaybe people would stop ripping ewach other appart. In stead of not beinglike clowns, maybe more people should be! It would certainly make people takenotice of how utterly ridiculous most arguments are and how working togetherwould be much more effective.\nSo, before you downgrade the life of a clown, maybe you should walk a mile inmy shoes. The offer is open to you any time!\nThanks for listening.\nSMILE!\nChristy McDonaldGoodwill Ambassador (and clown)Ringling Brothers and Barnum& Bailey Circus Hometown Edition"}]}

If there's no one to blame, sometimes they look for someone to hate, even if it is ultimately self-destructive.\nA novice computer user downloads viruses, interacts with spyware and encounters a system crash. He calls tech support for the word processor he uses and lets them have it with both barrels.\nA flood hits a town and innocent people die and buildings are destroyed. The widows and bereaved families take it out on the insurance adjuster or government official who has come to help.\nThe economic downturn hits a town hard and some residents attack, quite personally, the hard-working school board members who had nothing to do with the bad news and in fact represent one of the best ways to ultimately recover.\nIn each case, the person being hated on is precisely the person who can do the most to help. And yet sometimes, we can't help ourselves. It takes significant emotional maturity to separate the event from the people in proximity to the event, and any marketer or organization that deals with the public needs to embrace the fact that just because you're close to where the bad thing happened doesn't mean it's your fault.\nThat software tech rep, the one who didn't cause your viruses, she's the very best person to calmly explain how to get rid of them.\nThat insurance adjuster might be able to get you some money to help you start to rebuild your life.\nAnd the school board?

They remember how you behave when you're under pressure, stressed out and at wits end.\nEmotional maturity is underrated.\nPS when confronted with misplaced rage, the proper response is not to point out the misplaced part. It's to acknowledge the rage part. One big reason that vilification occurs is that the angry person feels as though not enough attention or sympathy is being paid.\nThe long term solution for marketers (and those that believe in civil society) is to make it socially unacceptable to vent like this.

On land, they're ungainly, but when they find the right conditions\u2026 they take off. And fly and fly and fly. An albatross can fly for days or weeks, with a heart rate similar to its resting heart rate. Possibly the best bird ever invented.\nAlbatross businesses are great to have but not easy to launch. Rather than the excitement of the big time launch and then the constant promotion and high expense of a typical business, an albatross business mucks around for a while, but since it's designed for effortless long flight, it gains steam and then keeps going.\nToday is the third anniversary of the launch ofSquidoointo alpha. We certainly had a slow take off, then a bump in the wind 18 months ago with spammers and the search engines, but we've reached a glide path. Note two things about this chart:\n1. It takes three years to be an overnight success, sometimes more.\nThat means you need to either raise enough money from patient investors to stick it out\u2026 or, as in our case, be so lean and efficient that the cost of lasting long enough to make it profitable is one you can handle.\n2. It's possible to organize a company around the idea that success breeds success.\nTraditional businesses don't do that\u2026 if you're a wedding photographer or a restaurant, you're not going to have an albatross business. These businesses need ongoing promotion which leads to ongoing business, and around and around. There's clearly a benefit to reputation and word of mouth, but you're rarely going to see the hockey stick that is the goal of most internet businesses.\nThe two secrets, I think, are:\n1. Plan for the long slow ramp up. That means super low overhead and patience and not trying to launch with a huge splash because you're impatient.\n2. Architecture matters. If you intend to build an albatross, you'll want to design a business where each customer brings you new customers, where the more it gets used, the better it works.\nWe have a\u00a0 l o n g\u00a0 way to go before Squidoo hits the stride we're seeking, but on our third anniversary, it seemed like a worthwhile time to take a look of how close we are getting to our flight path. An albatross can achieve a 22:1 glide path\u201322 meters out for every meter down or up. That's the goal, leverage.\nPS if you've never seen the albatrossmatingritual, you really should.

D. Salinger a Liar? Are You?\nBlog: Did Holden Caulfieldreallyhave the adventures and angst the author wrote about? Of course not. There wasn\u2019t a Holden Caulfield.Catcher in the Ryeis a work of fiction.\nSo what\u2019s the difference between fiction and a lie? Is storytelling lying?\nI think the distinction we make for ourselves is that novelists don\u2019t pretend that they are telling us the truth. They don\u2019t set out to deceive because they write novels, which are clearly labeled as untrue. No evil intent, no lie.\nJudging from my email and some postings on blogs here and there, it seems that some people have a trouble with the word \"liar\". Liar is a word that makes us angry.\nWhen I wroteAll Marketers Are Liars(Liar\u2019s Blog) I was trying to make a point about true lies.\nSome (mostly those that haven\u2019t bothered to read it) think I\u2019m telling people to lie and cheat and deceive and abandon what few ethics we\u2019ve got left. Nope! I\u2019m doing the opposite.\nIstartby telling you that you ARE telling a story whether you want to or not. You are a novelist, a film director, a fabulist. It\u2019s impossible to deliver the entire truth to anyone, ever, so by making choices, you\u2019re telling a story. If your blog is well-designed, that\u2019s part of your story. If your blog is ugly, that\u2019s a story too. Neither story has to do with the words. But you\u2019re still telling a story. We as marketers ought to recognize that and start acting that way\u2013our competition sure is.\nThenI say that telling a story that is inauthentic, inconsistent, hollow or filled with unstated side effects isn\u2019t just wrong, it\u2019s stupid. The best lies are true! True in the sense that you don\u2019t disappoint the listener when she discovers more facts about what you do.\nAny marketer who believes that they are in the business of telling the truth about what they do is delusional. You can\u2019t. Not enough time, not enough attention, not enough money.\nJ.D. Salinger understood this when he wrote his novels. He didn\u2019t try to tell the truth. He tried to tell a story that resonated.\nBe a true liar. Someone who knows he\u2019s in the storytelling business, someone who tells people about his ideas in terms they want to hear it. But be someone who\u2019s stories hold up under inspection."}]}

All the money would go to neighborhood improvements and policing.\nLower rents create new innovations, which leads to more interaction and more vibrant neighborhoods.

This is blogging and online art, wikipedia and the maker movement. These guys get a lot of press, and deservedly so, because they're changing everything.\nThe second, though, is distracting and ultimately a waste. We're creating a culture of clickers, stumblers and jaded spectators who decide in the space of a moment whether to watch and participate (or not).\nImagine if people went to the theatre or the movies and stood up and walked out after the first six seconds. Imagine if people went to the senior prom and bailed on their date three seconds after the car pulled away from the curb.\nThe majority of people who sign up for a new online service rarely or never use it. The majority of YouTube videos are watched for just a few seconds. Chatroulette institutionalizes the glance and click mentality. I'm guessing that more than half the people who started reading this post never finished it.\nThis is all easy to measure.

The Huffington Post has downgraded itself, pushing thoughtful storiesdown the page in exchange for linkbait and sensational celebrity riffs.This strategy gets page views, but does it generate thought or change?\nIf you create (or market) should you be chasing the people who click and leave? Or is it like trying to turn a cheetah into a house pet? Is manipulating the high-voltage attention stream of millions of caffeinated web surfers a viable long-term strategy?\nMass marketing used to be able to have it both ways. Money bought you audience. Now, all that buys you a mass market is wow and speed. Wow keeps getting harder and dives for the lowest common denominator at the same time.\nTimemagazine started manipulating the cover and then the contents in order to boost newsstand sales. They may have found a short-term solution, but the magazine is doomed precisely because the people they are pandering to don't really pay attention and aren't attractive to advertisers.\nMy fear is that the endless search for wow further coarsens our culture at the same time it encourages marketers to get ever more shallow. That's where the first trend comes in\u2026 the artists, idea merchants and marketers that are having the most success are ignoring those that would rubberneck and drive on, focusing instead on cadres of fans that matter. Fans that will give permission, fans that will return tomorrow, fans that will spread the word to others that can also take action.\nCulture has been getting faster and shallower for hundreds of years, and I'm not the first crusty pundit to decry the demise of thoughtful inquiry and deep experiences. The interesting question here, though, is not how fast is too fast, butwhat works?What works to change mindsets, to spread important ideas and to create an audience for work that matters? What's worth your effort and investment as a marketer or creator?\nThe difference this time is that driveby culture is both fastandfree. When there's no commitment of money or time in the interaction, can change or commerce really happen? Just because you can measure eyeballs and pageviews doesn't mean you should.\nIn the race between 'who' and 'how many',whousually wins\u2013if action is your goal.

If it were only that easy.\nWhat's interesting to me is that different products and ideas are spread by different groups of people.There isn't just one professional association of idea spreaders, with everyone else being passive.\nIf your authentic little Welsh restaurant gets hot, it's going to be because the chowhounds, the folks who love to talk about the next great place, are buzzing about it. On the other hand, if your blog gets a lot of traffic, it might just be because a few of the digerati are going on about it, spreading the idea.\nThis is obvious, of course.\nBut what you are you doing about it? Have you figured out which portion of your user base are the talkers? Is it possible to focus your development efforts on actually making something that they like? Or, are you confusing the people who talk about your competition or about other industries with the people you need to reach? Might not be the same tribe\u2026\nThe #1 cause of an idea that's not spreading or a business that's not growing is that they don't have a committed group of people spreading the word about them. If you treat everyone the same, you're not increasing the odds that some people will step up on your behalf.\nThis is the first question to ask someone who is frustrated at the rate their idea is spreading. \"Who are you hoping will talk about you?\" If you don't know, it's unlikely to happen all by itself. On the other hand, if a marketer is smart about finding, courting and delighting the group most likely to spread the idea, it's time well spent."}]}

Your boss wants something cheap. You want something tried and true so you don\u2019t get blamed. The end result?Mediocrity. Boring sameness. What a wasted opportunity.\nIn the scheme of things, a great room at a conference is a bargain. Spending what it takes to make it work has a huge payoff. That said, here are some thoughts:\n\u201cWhat does this remind me of?\u201d\nThat\u2019s the subliminal question that people ask themselves as soon as they walk into a room. If it reminds us of a high school cafeteria, we know how to act. If it\u2019s a bunch of round tables set for a chicken dinner, we know how to act. And if there are row upon row of hotel-type chairs in straight lines, we know how to sit and act glazed.\nIf it\u2019s a place where we\u2019re used to saying \u2018no\u2019, we\u2019re likely to say no. If it\u2019s a place where we\u2019re used to good news or important news or just paying attention, we\u2019ll do that.\nYou can use this Pavlovian reaction to your advantage, or you can be a victim of it. A non-traditional arrangement can make people sit up and take notice. A rock concert feel is going to raise the energy level of even the skeptics. A circle with no tables makes people feel naked. These are tools, and you get to choose.\nIf you have to serve lunch, serve lunch. Big round tables, lots of talking. Then have people stand up and go hear the speaker. In a different room, with a different setting, one that works. No one ever heard a speech that changed their lives when sitting around a round table having just eaten a lousy lunch. Mixing the settings serves no purpose, wastes time in the long run and saves very little money.\nDo you see that this is just more marketing? You tell a story with where you put the chairs.\nIf you could do one thing, make one choice, it should be this: make the room too small. Standing room only. People hanging into the hall. Watch what happens to your energy level.\nIf you\u2019re speaking TO people as opposed to encouraging a wide ranging discourse, put the stage along the narrow wall of the room. (in a 30 by 80 room, that means the 30 side). Making the room narrow and long is far better than wide, because it puts the audience in the plane of the speaker.\nThis also makes it far easier for the audience to see the speaker and the slides/screens at the same time. This is critical. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve watched people stare at the screen and avoid the speaker, or find themselves bouncing back and forth.\niMag: That\u2019s the projection of the speaker on the screen. This is pretty expensive, but for groups over 500, it\u2019s almost mandatory in our 1984-esque world. If you want to get far more bang for your buck, hire a second cameraman, with a hand held camera. When you switch from one view to the other, you add enormous action to the event.\nScreens: Big screens are a lot more reasonable than they used to be. Get the absolute biggest and brightest you can afford. Bigger! Big screens, near the speaker. Really close to the speaker. That\u2019s a big help for the audience and for your energy.\nVGA cables: Have more than one. Switchers are cheap. Nothing worse than having speakers stumbling around swapping laptops. And put the cables and the laptops up front, not in back to be controlled by a tech guy who doesn\u2019t care quite as much as you (or the speaker) does.\nMusic: Every time you introduce a speaker, play loud and inspiring pop music. Not for long, but enough to cue people to remember the way they feel at the Oscars and stuff. After all, those memes are there waiting for you to leverage them.\nMarching bands: Yes, they\u2019re cheap. No, people don\u2019t like them particularly. I\u2019ve seen this done a number of times, and people are more amazed and aghast than impressed.\nAisles: Watch a room fill up. People always sit on the aisle, don\u2019t they? Don\u2019t do rows of 40 or 50 chairs with no aisle. Have lots of aisles. Every ten chairs or so. Why not? Makes it faster to get in and to get out, and doesn\u2019t hurt your density so much.\nLights: Make it dark in the audience. Make it light on stage. This works every time. Practice the lighting in advance, even for a smaller group.\nQ&A: For large groups, don\u2019t do Q&A. It sucks all the energy out of the room and stilts the end, \u201cWell, if there are no more questions\u2026\u201d Instead, solicit questions from key people in advance, write them on index cards and have someone raring and ready to go with a microphone and a finite list of questions, bang, bang, bang. It\u2019s not a press conference, it\u2019s a speech.\nSmall groups: Even groups of two\u2013don\u2019t go along with a lousy setting just because that\u2019s what is offered to you. Why would you pitch yourself or your project in a noisy restaurant, seated on a banquette, with one person on your left and two on your right? Don\u2019t do it.\nIf you are using a laptop for a small group, get one with a big screen. Get a simple USB remote. Don\u2019t use live web access if at all possible. And make sure that the right person sees the screen (and you) at the same time. If you can\u2019t do these things, don\u2019t use the laptop.\nIf you\u2019re willing to travel to meet with someone, put in the extra effort to do it in a setting that works. Befriend the admin, befriend the maitre d, even from 1,000 miles away. Both you and the person you\u2019re meeting with benefit when you create a room that works."}]}

The subtext to her question was, \u201cthis is very different than what you\u2019re doing\u2026 is it better? worse?\u201d\nAs more and more people consider blogs for politics (cover of tomorrow\u2019s NY Times magazine) or business or ego or as a hobby, I wonder if we need to get a little taxonomic here (Carolus Linnaeus \u2013 Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia). Forgive me if others have done a better job, but here\u2019s my best shot.\nThere are three important kinds of blogs:\n1. News blogs. These are the original model. The idea is simple. An author (or authors\u2013seeBoing Boing: A Directory of Wonderful Things) chronicles the events of the day. This can be commentary on politics or news or dieting sites or merely pointers to interesting technology introductions.\nSome of the most popular blogs are just carefully edited indices of the best of today\u2019s Net. Others include a lot of pithy commentary on the part of the writer. News blogs are a fantastic solution to the noise filtering problem.\n2. Writer\u2019s blogs. You\u2019re reading one. These are blogs that while they occasionally riff about today\u2019s news, are mostly an opportunity for the writer to engage in an extended monologue. The monologue is influenced by reader feedback and new happenings, so it\u2019s a lot more interactive than a book, but it certainly isn\u2019t a conversation. I think this is a very new form of media (it\u2019s a process, not a batch).\n3. Our blogs. This is what Joi is at the forefront of. Our Blogs are blogs that are the tip of the community iceberg. A posting on an Our blog is nothing but a firestarter, a chance to start the conversation and see what happens.\nSometimes, it\u2019s easy to assume that all blogs are the same, and therefore a blog isn\u2019t the right solution for a given problem. At the same time, there are those in the blogging community who are upset when all blogs aren\u2019t the kind of blog that they\u2019re used to. I think it\u2019s early days, and there are bound to be a few other types of blogs as time goes on."}]}

If you\u2019re used to being able tocorner the market, it\u2019s easy to think that another medium is justanother medium.\nHow else to explain the exploits of the RIAA as they valiantly duelwith Napster, trying to put the genie of widespread music distributionback into the bottle. They\u2019re used to having a monopoly on thedistribution of music, and they want it back.\nHow else to explain the antics of the book industry as they stumbletheir way through the minefields of Microsoft, Stephen King and freee-books? \"Publishers control the distribution, not these weenies,dammit!\"\nIt was great to be a monopolist. Steady profits and no hassles. Itwould be great if we could stay monopolists forever, wouldn\u2019t it?\nBefore you call the Justice Department, let me explain. The limitedsupply of content, the few choices of distribution\u2013these practices areall legal\u2026 most of them are actually enforced by the government. Butunderstanding where these monopolies came from (and why they\u2019re goingaway-fast(!)) will give you a new way of looking at your business, andit turns out that this sort of analysis can open amazing new marketsand new ways of generating profits.\nWe know that if you offer a smart consumer two products that areabsolutely identical (same quality, similar brand attributes, just asconvenient), she\u2019ll choose the cheaper one. Gasoline stations haveprice wars-but movie theatres don\u2019t. Supermarkets lose money when theysell milk, but TV networks are dedicated to turning a profit on justabout everything. The heart of the mediabusinessis the prospect of being a monopolist-of getting paid alotmore than our products cost to make. But when the monopoly goes away,there\u2019s not a lot of room for obscene profits. In markets where peoplehave a choice between equals, the cheapest and most convenient oftenwin.\nOver time, the media business has done everything it can to be sure that consumersdon\u2019thave a choice. After all, a CD increases in price about 25 times fromthe time it\u2019s made to the time it\u2019s purchased by the listener. And a TVad that costs a network zero to broadcast might end up selling for amillion dollars.\nThere are three things that led to the monopolies we now enjoy:\nThis triad is responsible for the profits you\u2019re enjoying right now.Imagine a nightmare of a world in which all three legs on this stooldisappear. At the same time.\nTime to wake up. It just happened.\nTHE MONOPOLIES ARE DYING\u2026AND THEY\u2019RE GETTING DEADER\nThe past, the glorious, profit-making,funpast of the media business was based on:\u2022 scarce creators, under long term contracts\u2022 scarce retail outlets, able to be controlled with marketing muscle\u2022 scarce spectrum (few radio stations, few TV stations)\u2022 copyright laws (and a lack of technology) that limited theft of services\u2022 limited power of the creators to compete without a large media company as partner\nIt\u2019s hard to outline a point of view that shows the power of any form of media gettingstrongerover the next decade. There are going to be more TV channels, not less.More ways for authors to distribute their works, not less. More waysfor musicians to connect with listeners, not less. More ways forconsumers to sample or take content, not less.\nYou were a monopolist. You\u2019re not anymore.\nTo succeed in the old days, here\u2019s what you needed to do (choose any two!):1. Grab a piece of the electromagnetic spectrum, hopefully one limited by the government2. Buy up the supply of actors or writers3. Establish long term profitable relationships with distributors and retail outlets\nWelcome to a new century. In the new century, we all have the same goal:1. Establish a direct and positive relationship with the end user.\nIt sounds easy. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s scary. It\u2019s likely to wreck yourbusiness before it saves it. Doesn\u2019t matter. The truth is: businessesthat don\u2019t aggressively pursue this tactic will disappear.\n\u2026\nHow dare he! He has no big studio money. He has no relationshipswith CAA and he doesn\u2019t exhibit at Cannes or NATWest. Yet he has anaudience around the world. Yet he\u2019s building characters with realvalue-characters that will become toys or movies or t-shirts. He hasviolated every single rule of the old order, and he\u2019s still succeeding.\nCould you imagine this happening ten or twenty years ago?\nNow do this: VisitPublishers LunchYou\u2019ll get a free subscription to Publishers Lunch, a daily newsletterchronicling what\u2019s going on in the book business. It\u2019s free, of course,and it\u2019s always interesting and occasionally juicy. It\u2019s written anddistributed by one guy, who every day increases his power by talking tothousands of people in the book business.\nCould you imagine this happening five years ago?\nSorry to remind you, but consider the Drudge Report. Four years ago,nobody had ever heard of Matt Drudge. Today, for many Americans, he\u2019sone of their most important sources of news. He paid no dues, didn\u2019twork his way through a corporate hierarchy, owes nothing to the head ofthe network.\nHardly seems fair, does it?\n\u2026\n\u2026\nAre all three of these examples perfect businesses, bound tobankrupt you and your peers? No way. They\u2019re nits. Chinks in the armor.Little businesses that might get bigger. Sure, there are tons ofexample of well-financed new media companies that went under. That\u2019snot the point. The point is that individuals with little or no moneyare building real media properties that are attracting the consumersthatyouwant to attract. There will be plenty of carnage and disappointments in this new arena. Who cares? What matters is that thereisa new arena. It\u2019s mere presence means that the monopolies are dying.\nI had coffee with the executive producer of a network news show lastweek. He told me that every year, in addition to getting smaller insize, his audience, on average, ages almost a year. The people he needsin order to maintain his monopoly are finding something else to do withtheir time.\nNeed more proof? Take a look at Tivo and Replay. These digital VCRshave tiny audiences (but expect a bunch to sell this Christmas). It\u2019seasy to dismiss them as toys for the digerati. Easy, except for onefact: 80% of the people who use one of these devices skipallof the commercials during the shows they watch. ALL of them! Imagine.So much for the business model of the most powerful medium of all time.\n\u2026\nFace it. The barriers are falling and they\u2019re falling fast. If thereare limits to how many competitors you were facing, those limits aregoing away. There used to be room for just a few movies to open overLabor Day. But when movies are shown on DVD players in my house andyours, there\u2019s room for hundreds of millions of movies to open on thesame day!\nThink it\u2019s easy to sell banners on the Internet? There are 40million different sites, with more every day. How much of a premium areyou, the advertiser, willing to pay for one thousand impressions onthissite instead ofthatsite? That\u2019s why the CPM went from $100 a thousand to a buck in lessthan two years. What happens to the ad sales of your TV network whenthere are 40 million different TV networks? What happens to the budgetfor your new arthouse movie when there are millions of people crankingout their own arthouse movies?\nYou\u2019re not going out of business tomorrow. The structures you\u2019vebuilt and perfected are going to stick around for a long time. We stillwant blockbuster movies and the Top 40 and Tom Clancy\u2019s next book. Butit\u2019s not going to get better, more profitable or more fun. It\u2019s goingto get worse.\nAs I write this, NBC has flown hundreds of its best people toSydney. Is it possible to overpay for the Olympics? When the massmarket is long gone, and network viewership is at an all time low,probably not. It\u2019s a fun way to revisit the glory days of Ed Sullivanand Mary Tyler Moore. Alas, in the long run, the folks who run theOlympics will end up with all the money and NBC (or whatever network isdumb enough to take its place) ends up with two weeks of memories and ablack hole where their wallet used to be. People are wringing theirhands over NBC\u2019s Olympic ratings. They say they\u2019re lousy because of thetime zone issue. Nonsense. They\u2019re lousy because Americans are nolonger willing to sit down for two weeks and all watch the same stuff,especially when it\u2019s jammed with irrelevant commercials.\nThe alert reader now interrupts and shouts, \"Wait a minute!\" Afterall, Pop.com just went bust. Viacom spent a ton on MTVi, and look whereit got them. And Warner Bros. spent years and years with anentertainment portal (lately called Entertaindom) and it tanked as well.\n\"We\u2019re not against new media. We just think it\u2019s a bit of a fraud.\"\nAnd my response is to cry foul. I spent years dealing with many ofthese organizations, and I was astonished and overwhelmed by thecombination of old-media thinking, arrogance and lack of vision theymanaged to squeeze into just a few very well furnished audiences.\n\u2026\n\u2026Don\u2019t bring the old monopoly-driven mindsets to the non-monopolymarketplaces! Just because you can get away with being a bully (\"Do youknowwhoyou\u2019re talking to!\") in your current job doesn\u2019t meanthat the mindset is going to fly in a world where the rules aredifferent.\n\u2026\nSo now, the good news:\nOprah Winfrey launched a magazine in the Spring. It has millions of readers, starting from zero. Probably profitable from day 1.\nStephen King wrote a book and more than 150,000 gladly paid him for a chance to read the first chapter.\nJimmy Buffet is one of the most successfully recording artists working today, and he rarely makes a record.\nThe answer to your monopoly problem is to create a new monopoly. I call it the Permission Monopoly.\nHere\u2019s how it works:\nEveryone has a limited attention span. We can\u2019t read all the bookswe want, listen to all the music we want, go to all the movies. So wefilter. We ignore. We procrastinate. And we hide.\nHave you heard the new album from Bill Frisell? ReadDescarte\u2019s Error?Seen Croupier? Didn\u2019t think so. No time. Of course, if someone youtrusted insisted that you spend the time to try them out, you might. Ofcourse, if they were created by people you\u2019d liked in the past, you\u2019dbe more likely to try them out. If you could try them out for free,you\u2019d be more likely to try them out as well.\nIn the past, Tower Records or The Tattered Cover or WNEW or GeneralCinema was appointed (by default) as the arbiter of what we\u2019d payattention to. If it got played on the radio, we heard it. If it was bythe cash register, we saw it. If Brandon Tartikoff liked it, we watchedit.\nIn today\u2019s million channel universe, though, those arbiters are alot less powerful. Now, maybe I want Slate to recommend it. Now, maybethe programmer of my internet radio station has to cue it up.\nSo, without powerful arbiters, it\u2019s way harder for powerful mediacompanies to modify the marketing conversation. Way harder for tenwell-funded salespeople to get shelf space everywhere that matters. Wayharder for a crack PR person to get you a review in just the rightpublication.\nWhat\u2019s a megalomaniac media mogul to do?\nThe wrong strategy, it seems to me, is to go court and try to stopthe leaky bucket. It also seems like a mistake to call the authors andfilmmakers and others who abandon you, \"crazy\" or \"short-term focused\"or to say, \"well, they can get away with that but the others can\u2019t.\"\nThe defectors know something you don\u2019t. The defectors know that ifthey hurry, they can build a new monopoly, a monopoly you don\u2019tcontrol. They know that they can build a direct and long-termrelationship with the end user, one that will survive competitiveincursions and will last a long time.ifthey hurry.\nAnd so, learn from these folks.youshould hurry. Youmusthurry. If you understand that the game is radically and permanentlybeing changed, you can go out today and start building mutuallybeneficial relationships with your listeners/readers/watchers. You canoffer these folks something of value in exchange for their attention.You can then build a new monopoly.\nImagine trying to get Bill Clinton to allow you to publish his newautobiography. What happens when you can say, \"We have apermission-based relationship with 32 million Americans, all of whomlook forward to hearing from us every two weeks with our hot new bookofferings. And by the way, our competition doesn\u2019t even have 10 names.\"\nWhat happens when you\u2019re trying to break a great new trance band,and you have permission to send the first single, by e-mail, to 600,000kids who loved the last trance band you broke? Think that helps yourcareer?\nPLEASE NOTE: I\u2019mnottalking about treating consumers the way you andother marketers have been treating them for a century. No churn andburn. No contemptuous, \"we\u2019ll talk to you when we want to, otherwisekeep quiet!\" And no renting, buying or selling lists. No, I\u2019m talkingabout treating this new client the same way you treat your mostimportant retail account or radio station or theater owner. You don\u2019tshow up at his house in the middle of the night (or if you do, youbring a big box of cubans). You don\u2019t send them e-mail spam, or callthem on the phone over and over again.\nYou have a relationship. You understand that every interaction hasto benefit BOTH of you or the relationship is over. If you\u2019re going tobuild a monopoly on consumer attention, you\u2019ll need to do the samething.\nHere\u2019s how I boil it down to as few words as possible:1. Make it easy for your happy users to tell as many of their friends as possible.2. Give away free samples early and often.3. Get permission from anyone who likes what you do to follow up withanticipated, personal and relevant messages that benefit both of you.4. If this requires changing what you make and what you charge for, fine.5. If steps 1,2, 3 and 4 mess up your current business model, fine.\n\u2026\nThe new monopoly of the future ispermission. Permission to talk toyour customers directly about new stuff. Permission to teach,permission to ask, permission to learn. If you have that monopoly, youprofit over and over and over again.\n\u2026\nThe power is certainly moving. It\u2019s moving from five oligopolisticstatus quo gatekeepers that controlled money and promotion and retailto a much messier, faster-moving, more interesting amalgamation ofdatabase keepers, musicians and fans. Today, there\u2019s a chance to co-opparts of that system. Tomorrow, that chance will be gone."}]}

Then, when you ship out the CD, includeyournew CD in the box as well. You\u2019ve reached exactly the right people (purchasers! who spent money! who are fans!) at exactly the right moment.

It\u2019s real. We get stuck. Surrounded by people who are just as stuck. It can seem like progress is at a crawl.\nAnd then, we see a different way. Someone finds a lane we didn\u2019t even know existed. Quickly, they\u2019re joined by a few others, a cohort that\u2019s making a difference and moving precisely where they want to go.\nAll around us, there are people who want to protect their status quo, while others are on a path to level up. Some careers are about checking boxes while others set people up to draw the boxes.\nThis blog, of course, is for people who want to do work that matters. It might be a more difficult route, but it\u2019s worth it.\nThe work of leveling up involves pushing past perceived limitations, understanding that they\u2019re not real.\nAnd it involves surrounding yourself with people on a similar journey.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s required here?\u201d is the question we were taught to ask. This is the loyal employee and the reliable cog, meeting spec.\n\u201cWhat is the opportunity here?\u201d is a totally different question. It\u2019s about contribution and forward motion, not simply compliance.\nFor people in a hurry to learn and contribute, the range of learning options online is a boon. You can learn more, and more quickly, than ever before. The options range from straight video courses (some of which are really quite expensive, some of which are nearly free) to intensive interpersonal community interactions. Some involve fun topics and well-known celebrities, while others are dry video monologues offered in exchange for a continuing education credit.\nNearly three years ago, we started thealtMBA. Our goal was to find people who were already enrolled in the journey of leveling up and making a difference\u2013and so we created an intensive thirty-day workshop that would help them do better work.\nThe altMBA is not like the other online courses you might see offered from various websites. We have a coach for every ten students, with group work, daily video calls and most of all, peer-to-peer projects. There are no gurus, no video lectures, nothing to memorize.\nIt\u2019s easier to take (and make) a straight video course, but I\u2019m not sure it can deliver the results worthy of your time.\nOne of the key choices we made is that we don\u2019t have tests or a fancy accreditation. That\u2019s because these enforcement tools separate the student from the process, turning it into something adversarial. The question, \u201cwill this be on the test?\u201d is a question about howlittlecan I do, and about compliance.\nOn the other hand, if you\u2019re enrolled, then no enforcement is necessary. If you\u2019re enrolled in the journey, no one has to hassle you. Instead of seeking to do less,you seek to do more.\nThe altMBA was created to help people see more clearly, make better decisions and engage with their soft skills, the ones that truly matter. This is a cohort of people who have decided to leave their imagined limitations behind.\nWith thealtMBAcontinuing to thrive, we\u2019ve taken some of what we\u2019ve learned from the process and expanded it into a new learning paradigm, online seminars we\u2019re calling workshops.\nUnlike the altMBA, these new workshops don\u2019t have a high coach ratio, organized learning groups or peer-to-peer projects. Instead, we\u2019re building online communities with dozens of video lessons, lessons that each participant can turn into a chance to improve their own projects. In a typical workshop, there are hundreds of thousands of page views every few weeks, and a post is made every few minutes, 24 hours a day.\nReal people, interacting with each other because the journey is worth it. Seeing in others what they know they have in themselves.\nThese workshops are far more tactical than the altMBA, but they still end up challenging people to ask themselves (and each other) the really hard questions.\nWe\u2019re calling these theAkimbo workshops. They include The Marketing Seminar, The Podcasting Fellowship and several others. And we only offer them to people who are already headed in that direction. It\u2019s voluntary education, it\u2019s for people who have decided to get on the bus and get to where they\u2019re going.\nI hope you\u2019ll check out both the altMBA and the Akimbo workshops.

Here's the riff:\nPoliticians, non-profits and most of all, amateur marketers believe that all they need to do to win the day is to recite a fact. You're playing Monopoly and you say, \"I'll trade you Illinois for Connecticut.\" The other person refuses, which is absurd. I mean, Illinois costs WAY more than Connecticut. It's a fact. There's no room for discussion here. You are right and they are wrong.\nBut they still have the property you want, and you lose. Because all you had was a fact.\nOn the other hand, the story wins the day every time. When the youngest son, losing the game, offers to trade his mom Baltic for Boardwalk, she says yes in a heartbeat. Because it feels right, not because it is right.\nYour position on just about everything, including, yes, your salary, your stock options, your credit card debt and your mortgage are almost certainly based on the story you tell yourself, not some universal fact from the universal fact database.\nNot just you, everyone.\nWork with that.]"}]}

A quick look will show you that there are dozens of emails moved there by Google that you probably wish you had seen. In the last week, I found several personal notes, several calendar invites (including ones for Google\u2019s own calendar), and newsletters from Tim Ferriss and others.\nWe are finding that 20% of the Slack invites we\u2019re sending to people are ending up misfiled in the promo folder as well.\nMost of us live with the misfiling because we don\u2019t know about it, because we save so much time on the junk that disappears, and partly because we don\u2019t know how to easily fix it without dragging emails over one at a time.\nEnough of the writers and orgs I work with were frustrated by the incorrect filing of important mail by Google that I decided to work with my team to build a simple system that with just a few clicks, would move many of the emails you\u2019re missing out of the promo folder back to where they belong.\nIt does this without signing you up for any new lists, without sharing your data with anyone, without reading your email.\nAll we\u2019ve done is built a list of good stuff (our gold list), senders you might have signed up for but are missing.\nAnd it\u2019s free.\nYou can see the preliminary page here:98voices.com\nAnd we\u2019ve published ourcode basefor anyone to see on GitHub.\nBut\u2026\nGoogle has rejected the script.Even if you want to use it, Google won\u2019t let you.\nIt\u2019s not really clear to us what the problem is, and\u00a0after six weeks of discussing this with them, I decided to share our impasse here on the blog.\nThis is all we\u2019ve been told, unedited:\n\u201cGmail\u2019s tabbed inbox experience puts emails where our users want them to be, based on user corrections. Users may further customize with filters, or disable tabs altogether.\u201d \u00a0\u2014 Google spokesperson\n\u201cThe Gmail API\u2019s data use policies give our users the confidence they need to keep their data safe.

We\u2019ll share it with them. We\u2019re hopeful that they\u2019ll see that it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interest to let you easily take control of the folder and get the email you\u2019d like to get out of the Promo folder.\nThanks."}]}

How much does it cost Chanel to produce one more bottle of perfume? How about one more digital copy of a Grateful Dead concert?\nThe cost of thenextitem produced is called 'marginal cost'. It doesn't include set-up fees, rent, years of training, insurance or all the other huge costs an organization might pay. It's merely the cost of one more unit.\nIn a competitive, undifferentiated market, the price will generally be lowered by competitors until it is just above marginal cost. Think about that\u2026 If it costs a dollar to make something, and your competitor is selling for $1.10, then in an efficient market, you have every incentive to sell your item for a penny less than that. It's better than not selling it.\nThere are many implications of this, the first being the explanation of why so much stuff online is free. Free is a magical concept, the place where trial and virality live. If the marginal cost of a new user is virtually zero (and in an ad supported business, a new user is actually profitable, not a cost) then it's no surprise that it's hard to charge for your app when there are other apps that do precisely what yours does.\nBig, established companies have traditionally had a difficult time understanding this concept. The market for ebooks, for example, ended up in Federal court because otherwise smart people in book publishing couldn't get their arms around the idea that their marginal cost of an ebook delivered by Amazon was precisely zero. No paper, no shipping, no ink.\nTheir response was to talk about all of their fixed costs (which are real, and which are important). Things like typesetting and advances and editing and promotion\u2026\nBut none of those things are marginal costs. That means that someone entering the market, someone with nothing to lose, is happy to wipe out as many fixed costs as he can and then price as close to zero as he can get away with. It's not nice nor does it feel fair, but it's true and it works.\nThe only defense against this race to marginal cost is to have a product that is differentiated, that has no substitute, that is worth asking for by name.\nIf your product has a low marginal cost and a traditionally high price, particularly if it's one of a kind in its market, then you're in a great position to benefit from sampling. Which is why vodka companies are happy to sponsor parties and why cell phone companies will do almost anything to get you in the door.\nUntil you understand the true marginal cost of your products or services, you can't make smart decisions about pricing or customer acquisition.\nIndustries with zero marginal-cost products and services are inherently unstable until someone figures out how to become the king of the hill, the leader, the one worth picking because everyone else is. When that happens, the truth above about efficient markets goes away\u2026 because a market with one dominant leader isn't efficient any more."}]}

Successful change is almost always specific, not general. You don't have a chance to make mass change, but you can make focused change.\nThe challenge of mass media was how to run ads that would be seen by just about everyone and have those ads pay off. That problem is gone, because you can no longer run an ad that reaches everyone. What a blessing. Now, instead of yelling at the masses, the marketer has no choice but to choose her audience. Perhaps not even with an ad, but with a letter, or a website or with a product that speaks for itself. And yet, our temptation is to put on a show foreveryone, to dream of bestseller lists and the big PR win.\nSo the first, most important question is, \"who do we want to change?\"\nIf you can't answer this specifically, do not proceed to the rest. By who, I mean, \"give me a name.\" Or, if you can't give me a name, then a persona, a tribe, a spot in the hierarchy, a set of people who share particular worldviews. People outside this group should think you're crazy, or at the very least, ignore you.\nThen, be really clear about:\nWhat does he already believe?\nWhat is he afraid of?\nWhat does he think he wants?\nWhat does he actually want?\nWhat stories have resonated with him in the past?\nWho does he follow and emulate and look up to?\nWhat is his relationship with money?\nWhat channel has his permission?

Who does he trust and who does he pay attention to?\nWhat is the source of his urgency\u2014why will he changenowrather than later?\nAfter he has changed, what will he tell his friends?\nNow that you know these things, go make a product and a service and a story that works.

The value of the degree increases the number of students who want to attend, which further enhances their fame. In fact, they're called, \"selective,\" because they don't let many people in. Here's an amazing truth: many colleges promote their schools to students who can't possibly get in, just so the number of applications will go up, so they can reject more students and thus appear more selective, which will, perversely, make them more popular as a school to apply to.\nA class taken at the Harvard continuing education program is not 'worth' nearly as much as one taken by someone who got in to real Harvard. Because getting in is scarce.\nClass enrollment is scarce. You need to get up early, or game the system or get lucky to get a seat in the best classes. We happily applaud the value of a small-group seminar and decry the 300 person lecture because the intimacy that comes with this sort of scarcity is valuable.\nAccreditation further enhances scarcity, as does the requirement that a certain number of teachers have a doctorate degree.\nMOOCs and online education, of course, turn all of this upside down. There's no extra cost to having more students in an online course. 100,000 students isn't at all unusual. Abundance! Not only that, but since anyone can take any course, there's an abundance of choice. A typical university might offer just one or two intro courses in artificial intelligence, but the internet can easily offer a hundred or a thousand.\nAbundance means that there's far less brand value in saying you took a course, because the fact that you took the course isn't rare or scarce.The learning is valuable, not the proof you took it.\nNow that just about anyone can continue their education, just about everyone must. You must, because if you're not keeping up, you're falling behind. You must because the new abundance creates a new expectation. \"What do you mean you don't understand that\u2026\"\nHere's the big leap: When we were offering you the valuable prize of a brand-name degree, that scarcity required you to jump through hoops to get it. It meant you had to spend years in high school following the pre-college rules just to get in. It meant that we had to test you in each course, to prove you learned it. The proof was what you exchanged for your A, and your A was the coin you needed to buy your summa cum laude degree, the thing of value.\nIn the world of abundance, there's no scarce degree. So testing you as a form of scarce proof is silly. No, the reward is simpler\u2013learn something because you want to learn it, not because you need a grade on a curve.\nForgive me for going on, but I wanted to expose this line of thinking to help you see how flipped and flopped our experience of education is about to become.\nThe old system isn't going away. I still want my surgeon and my engineer to be certified and to prove that they've learned what they were supposed to learn. But more and more of the education we're valuing today is about the soft skills of decision making and creativity and most of all, about the choice to grow and step up. And that sort of learning doesn't easily happen in a scarcity-based institution.\nLearn what you want to learn.\nPick yourself.\nDo it often.\nDon't do it for proof, do it because the learning itself is worth it.\nOrganize and teach and lead, because it's a great way to learn, because it's the right thing to do and because it is a new sort of scarcity, the scarcity of people who care.\n[coming later this week: details on our first course and how you can start organizing for it]."}]}

Breast cancer research is the best-funded of all cancers,(3) and that is because of Nancy Brinker\u2019s leadership.\u00a0 Nancy decided that fighting breast cancer was worth fighting for.\u00a0 Because of her efforts, drastically more resources (public and private) are in play to find a cure.\nThis is not about competition for resources, this is about increasing the size of the pie.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen an unprecedented growth in global wealth in the last two decades: there are currently 95,000 ultra-high net worth individuals in the world \u2013 people with $30 million or more of investable assets.4\u00a0 \u00a0 On top of that, there are more than $60 trillion worth of investment assets in the market today, with an increasing amount of this money thinking more long-term about the big problems facing the world: energy and water scarcity, greenhouse gases, global commodity shortages, healthcare and education delivery, poverty alleviation\u2026you name it.\nThe allocation of these resources matters.\nConvincing the most powerful, resource-rich people you know that allocating some of their capital to the issues you\u2019re addressing matters.\nYou\u2019re devoting your life, your spirit, your energy, your faith into making the vision you have of a better future into a reality.\nSo why are you so scared to ask people for money?\u00a0 Why do you feel afraid to say: \u201cThis problem is so important and so urgent that it is worth your time and your money to fix it.\u00a0 I\u2019m devoting my whole life to fixing this problem.\u00a0 I\u2019m asking you to devote some of your resources to my life\u2019s work too.\u201d\nMaybe it\u2019s because:\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 People think that asking for money is all about asking for money.\u00a0 It is and it isn\u2019t.\u00a0 Most of the time it is about inspiring someone to see the world the way you do \u2013 with the same understanding of the problems and the same vision of how it can be overcome \u2013 and convincing them that you and your organization can actually make that vision into a reality.\u00a0 The resources come second.\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 People think that storytelling is a gift, not a skill.\u00a0 Learning how to do this \u2013 to be an effective storyteller, to consistently connect with different people from different walks of life and convince them to see the world as you do and walk with you to a better future \u2013 is hard, but it\u2019s a skill like any other.\u00a0 It\u2019s true that some people are born with it.\u00a0 But it still can be learned and practiced, and if your nonprofit is going to succeed, you\u2019d better have more than one or two people who can pull this off.\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 Money = Power.\u00a0 Our society has done a spectacular job of creating enormous amounts of wealth.\u00a0 At the same time, wealth is associated with power, and not having wealth can feel like not having power.\u00a0 So going to someone who has money and saying, \u201cYou have the resources, please give some of them to me\u201d doesn\u2019t feel like a conversation between equals.\nHow about this instead: \u201cYou are incredibly good at making money.\u00a0 I\u2019m incredibly good at making change.\u00a0 The change I want to make in the world, unfortunately, does not itself generate much money.\u00a0 But man oh man does it make change.\u00a0 It\u2019s a hugely important change.\u00a0 And what I know about making this change is as good and as important as what you know about making money.\u00a0 So let\u2019s divide and conquer \u2013 you keep on making money, I\u2019ll keep on making change. And if you can lend some of your smarts to the change I\u2019m trying to make, well that\u2019s even better.\u00a0 But most of the time, we both keep on doing what we\u2019re best at, and if we keep on working together the world will be a better place.\u201d\n4.\u00a0 \u00a0 I\u2019m terrified you\u2019ll say \u2018no.\u2019 We all hate rejection.\u00a0 Being rejected when asking for money is a double whammy.\u00a0 You were already scared to ask, and then the person said no.\u00a0 They have all the power.\u00a0 You walk away, head down, empty hat in hand.\nGet over it.\u00a0 You\u2019re still devoting your life to this work.\u00a0 You shared an idea with someone.\u00a0 You didn\u2019t convince them today, but you probably got their attention.\u00a0 Maybe you\u2019ll convince them tomorrow.\u00a0 Maybe they\u2019ll tell a friend.\u00a0 Maybe you learned something that will make your pitch better the next time.\u00a0 At least you got your story out there to the right person.\nYou made a change \u2013 you just didn\u2019t get any money in return.\nI\u2019ve met too many nonprofit CEOs who say \u201cI hate fundraising.\u00a0 I don\u2019t fundraise.\u201d\u00a0 If you\u2019re being hired as a nonprofit CEO and the Board tells you that you won\u2019t be fundraising, they\u2019re either misguided or lying.\nTell them they\u2019re wrong.\u00a0 Tell them that your job as a CEO is to be an evangelist for your idea and to convince others about the change you want to see in the world.\u00a0 Tell them that if this idea is worth supporting then they should jump in with both feet and support it with their time and money and by telling their friends it is worth supporting.\nSpending your time talking to powerful, influential people about the change you hope to see in the world is a pretty far cry from having fundraising as a \u201cnecessary evil.\u201d\nDo you really believe that the \u201creal work\u201d is JUST the \u201cprograms\u201d you operate?\u00a0 (the school you run; the meals you serve; the vaccines you develop; the patients you treat?)\u00a0 \u00a0Do you really believe that it ends there?\u00a0 Do you really believe that in today\u2019s world, where change can come from anyone and anywhere, that convincing people and building momentum and excitement and a movement really doesn\u2019t matter?\nOf course your programs or investments are real work.\u00a0 But so is evangelizing, communicating, sharing, convincing, cajoling, and arm-twisting.\u00a0 So are videos and images and stories and ideas.\nIf your ideas and programs and people and vision are so great, shouldn\u2019t people be willing to reach into their pockets and fund them?\u00a0 \u00a0If it\u2019s worth spending your life doing this work, shouldn\u2019t you or someone in your organization be able to convince someone else that the work is worth supporting?\nIn the for-profit world, nothing happens if you don\u2019t have a compelling product with a compelling story that wins out in the marketplace of ideas and gets people to act.\u00a0 People get so excited about Apple\u2019s products that they blog about the next release, scour the Internet for registered patents, spread ideas and rumors about what is coming next, and convince the people around them that Apple = cool.\u00a0 Do you think this would happen without Steve Jobs living and breathing the brand each and every day?\nSo how is it that in the nonprofit sector we create this illusion that growth and change and impact can happen absent this kind of energy and engagement?\nThere\u2019s this unspoken idea floating around that \u201cfundraisers\u201d can go about their work in a vacuum, having quiet, unimportant conversations with nameless, faceless rich people, while all the while the people who do the real work (the program folks) can go about their business, separate from and unconnected to this conversation.\nWhat a waste.\nDon\u2019t you think that creating a tribe5 of connected, engaged, passionate evangelists for your cause will create a positive feedback loop that will amplify the change you hope to see in the world?\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t matter if that tribe is 300 powerful, smart, wealthy people or 3 million regular folks who believe in you and the change you hope to make.\u00a0 If they are passionate and engaged and you give them a way to help, you will amplify your impact.\nIf nothing else, then, we need a new word.\u00a0 Fundraising is about a transaction \u2013 I raise funds from you, you get nothing in return.\nI\u2019d rather be an evangelist, a storyteller, an educator, a translator, a table-pounder, a guy on his soap box, a woman with a megaphone, a candidate for change.\u00a0 I want to talk to as many people as I can about my ideas \u2013 whether in person or in newsletters or on Facebook or Twitter or in the Economist or at the TED conference or at Davos \u2013 and capture their imagination about the change I hope to see in the world.\nDon\u2019t you?\n\u2014-1 It\u2019s called Acumen Fund (www.acumenfund.orgor http://blog.acumenfund.org).2http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en/index.html3http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/NCI/research-fundingorhttp://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/06/cancer-funding-does-it-add-up/4http://www.us.capgemini.com/worldwealthreport07/State_of_the_World_Wealth_2007.pdf.

If you can offer a return on investment, an engineering solution, more sales, no tax audits, a cute haircut, the fastest rollercoaster, a pristine beach, reliable insurance payouts at the best price, peace of mind, productive consulting or any other measurable result, this is a great place to start.\n2.Thrills. More difficult to quantify but often as important, partners and customers respond to heroism. We are amazed and drawn to over the top effort, incredible risk taking on our behalf, the blood, sweat and tears that (rarely) comes from a great partner. A smart person working harder on your behalf than you'd be willing to work\u2013that's pretty compelling.\n3.Ego. Is it nice to feel important? You bet. When you greet us at the door with a glass of white wine, put our name in the lobby of the hotel, actually treat us better than anyone else does (not just promise it, but do it)\u2026 This can get old really fast if you industrialize and systemize it, though.\nThis explains why the local branch of the big insurance company has trouble growing. It's hard for them to outdeliver the other guys when it comes to the cost effectiveness of their policy (#1). They are unsuited from a personality and organizational point of view to do #2. And they just can't scale the third.\nPut just about any business with partners into this matrix and you see how it works. Book publishing, for sure. Hairdressers. Spas. Even real estate.\nThe Ritz Carlton is all about #3, ego, right? And on a good day, there's a perception that the guys at Apple are hellbent on amazing us yet again, delivering on #2, taking huge career and corporate risks on our behalf. As soon as they stop doing that, the tribe will get bored.\n(There's a variation of ego, #3, that comes from being in good company. This is what gets people to sign up for Davos, or to choose ICM as their agent. Your ego is stroked by knowing that only people as cool as you are part of this gig. Sort of the anti-Groucho opportunity. Nice position, if you can get it, because it scales.).\nIt's tempting, particularly for a small business, to obsess about the first\u2014results\u2014to spend all its time trying to prove that the ROI is higher, the brownies are tastier and the coaching is more effective.

If you hoard information, for example, today your prospects will simply click and find it somewhere else. If you seek to charge above average prices for below average products, your customers will discover this, and let the world know. In a free market with plenty of information, it's very hard to succeed merely by loving the money your customers pay you.\nI think it's fascinating to note that some of the most successful organizations of our time got there by focusing obsessively on service, viewing compensation as an afterthought or a side effect.

For example, the letter \"e\" appears in English far more often than the letter \"u\". For just about every human thing we look at (record album sales, votes in political campaigns, income) there's a distribution with hits and with non-hits. Click on the picture at right to enlarge.\nChris Anderson helped us understand a huge implication of the power law curve in his classicThe Long Tail. The relevant notion follows\u2026\nIn any physical store, the store owner has to make bets. She needs to buy inventory, to choose this over that, to make decisions in advance about what's going to sell. With Christmas coming, the owner might need to make these decisions five months in advance, with no chance to re-order if there's a hit and nothing but the trash bin available for what doesn't sell.\nThe relentless physics of the situation, then, means that retailers needed the ability to not just pick hits, but tomakethem. And so they invented thespeed tableand the pile of stuff at the checkout. They perfected the end cap display and the free standing insert as well.\nYears ago, getting our products on the table next to the check out at Target and Lechmere was enough to make the year at the software company where I worked. Two big retailers picked our product and that was enough.\nRetailers want to be kings and they want to annoint kings. They want the lever to decide what sells and what doesn't, because it earns them power of pricing and profit (if the retailer can make your product a hit, she can extract better terms. If all she does is sell what sells, then the manufacturer is in charge).\nThanks to the long tail, the digital world ignored this thinking. The iTunes store, and Netflix, for example, take the position that, \"We're going to sell everything, and a lot of it. We don't carewhichthing, because it's all the same to us. Just put everything in the store and the market will sort it out.\"\nAs a result, they have far less promotional power. They didn't build a lever. The app store doesn't make a hit, it contains hits. Most long tail retailers are staffed around this idea and have a culture that reflects it. They'll sell everything/anything, because the longer the tail, the better.\nMarketers, of course, wanttheirproduct to be the hit, and they're always in search of someone who will make that happen. They understand that the long tail sellers will do well because they sell everything, but marketers don't care about everything\u2013they care about their thing.\nAnd so sites likeLivingSocialandWoot) built online levers, permission assets that allow them to become the new kingmakers. If they pick your product and alert their audience, you have a hit, at least for a short while (and sometimes at great cost to the marketer, which turns into profit for the kingmaker.)\nSeeing the success of retailers who are able to make kings, sites like Netflix are trying to figure out how to transform themselves. Finding the lever, though, isn't trivial. The cultural shift from ubiquity to selection is difficult.\nThe challenge for online retailers (and perhaps for your company) is to build the attention and trust and leverage you need to make kings, to earn attention and trust and make hits. While it's digitally enticing to be the indifferent-to-choice long-tail retailer, the fact is that marketers will always be willing to pay a premium to someone with the ability to generate a hit."}]}

Mostly, you will meet and engage with freelancers from around the world who will help you accomplish your goals (and vice versa).\nThe Freelancers Workshop is focused on just one thing:Helping you get better clients.Because better clients are the only way for a freelancer to find the support and respect and income you seek.\nAnd, also today (because I want you to make the choice!) we\u2019re relaunching the famedBootstrapper\u2019s Workshop.To date, thousands of people have experienced this deep dive into making deliberate choices about how to be an entrepreneur without scraping together money from investors and banks.\nI\u2019ve been talking about the freelancer/bootstrap/entrepreneur trichotomy for years. Here\u2019s what I hear most often:\n\u201cThank you for giving me permission to be a freelancer. It\u2019s as though a weight was lifted, and I\u2019m doing the best work of my career.\u201d\nand\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad that I don\u2019t have to obsess about valuations, bro fundraising culture and the rest of it. Our business continues to thrive, because we\u2019re proud to be bootstrappers.\u201d\n\nResources: More than 23,000 people have taken my Freelance course on Udemy. You can get itherefor 10% off.\nAnd nearly a million people have read the Bootstrapper\u2019s Bible. Here\u2019s a freecopy.\nThe new workshops take these ideas and run with them. They connect you to others on the same path, using the proven Akimbo methods to help you go way beyond text or video and dive deep into how it works and why.\nToday\u2019s an excellent day to decide if you\u2019re aFreelancer, aBootstrapperor something else\u2026 And if you visit the site, look for the purple circle for a rapidly decreasing discount for early birds.\n"}]}

[And you came through,big time!The goal is already reached, in less than three hours. Thank you. The Kickstarter is open for another four weeks, and there are plenty of rewards still\u2013check it out.]\nMy new book launches today\u2013but you won\u2019t be able to read it until January.\nLet me explain:\nBooks take a long time to invent, produce, ship and go on sale. Almost all of that work happens on faith, and it\u2019s then followed by a frenzy of promotion and anxiety, as the publisher and author try to find out if there\u2019s actually desire for the book. Activating the tribe at theendof the process is nerve-wracking and inefficient. For the reader, it\u2019s annoying to hear about a book 32 times from a panicked author who has her back against the wall, and then in every media outlet you turn to.\nAs part of my 25-year quest to find a better way to make and promote books, I\u2019m launching a hybrid experiment today. The idea is to do it in public, and to use widely available tools that can be emulated by other authors and other publishers if it works.\nThe problem with traditional publishing is that you do all the work and take all the riskbeforeyou find out if the audience is ready and willing to buy the book. And you have only a few days to go from \u201cit\u2019s new\u201d to \u201cit\u2019s over.\u201d\nI think there\u2019s a new way to think about this, a hybrid of old and new, one that activates true fans and makes it easy to spread the idea through the tribe and beyond.\nIt starts with a Kickstarter* page. A lot of the details of what I\u2019m describing are on that page, so feel free to check it out when we\u2019re done here.\nA successfulKickstartis great (Amanda Palmeris our hero), but what happens after that? How do you take the buzz and connection and scale it?\nMy idea: Kickstart + bookstore + ebooks.\nThe publisher (my key to the bookstore) is only willing to go ahead with the rest of the plan if my Kickstarter works. No Kickstarter, no distribution, the stakes are high. (As you saw at theDomino Project, the ebook part is easy now, but the bookstore is still critical to reach the many readers who find and buy books in stores).\nIf the Kickstarter works, thenall the funders will get to read the book before anyone else, plus there are bonuses and previews and special editions. A few weeks after the early funders (that would be you) get to read it, the book will be available to book buyers for purchase the traditional way (wherever fine books are sold in the US, including digital readers). Of course, the Kickstarter funders get a better price, get it first and get unique bonuses, plus the pleasure of being in early\u2013and knowing that they made it happen. The only way this book becomes real is if my readers get behind it now.\nBy using Kickstarter early in the process, we eliminate book publisher/bookseller skepticism and create the excitement they need to actually stock and promote the book. Those books you see stacked up by the front window at the bookstore? That\u2019s not an accident. That\u2019s a promotion planned months in advance, based almost entirely on how optimistic the publisher is about a book\u2019s prospects.\nSo that\u2019s the idea\u2013a way that any author with a following can divide the publishing process into three pieces\u2013get the true fans on board early, give them something to talk about just before the book is in stores, and then use online and offline bookstores to do what they do best and distribute far and wide. It moves the power in the process to where it belongs\u2013to motivated readers and their authors.\nIt's not easy to build a following, and it takes time, but I hope you'll help me show authors and publishers that it's worth it. Here's a short link you can share:http://kck.st/KvkY4h\nI\u2019ll update you four times in the next four weeks about how we\u2019re doing. Thank you for helping me make this work, and for publishing your own great idea as soon as you are ready.\n* [Three Kickstarter details:\nThank you for your help."}]}

The people I encountered (more than a dozen), were, with just one exception, beaten. Stooped shoulders and sad eyes, they\u2019ve given up.\nThis wouldn\u2019t matter to you, except I saw precisely the same behavior at a dot com company I visited in NY earlier this week. The same look of failure, the same feeling of impending, slow, inexorable doom.\nA few minutes later, I had another meeting and it was completely different. The attitude, at a company in essentially the same business, couldn\u2019t have been more different. The answer to every question was \"why not?\" instead of \"why?\"\nMarketing isn\u2019t done by computers, it\u2019s done by people. And people who sense opportunity and have the confidence to be remarkable will always defeat defensive actions by people who have given up."}]}

Not only did we feel lousy at the end of the day, but other people rarely saw us at our best.\nNow that it\u2019s clear that the nature of work and meetings has changed forever, perhaps this is a good moment to embrace what\u2019s possible.\nI\u2019ve put together a rig in my office that is noteworthy for two reasons:\nHere\u2019s a shortsample.\nAnd here\u2019s a photo of what it looks like from my side.\nHere\u2019s how to do it.\nFirst! It\u2019s free, it takes about one minute and will change the way you feel at the end of the day. In Zoom, find the button for HIDE SELF VIEW. (Here\u2019s alink). What this means is that as in real life, you won\u2019t be able to see yourself. It turns out that looking in the mirror all day wears us out. You\u2019ll have to change the setting at the start of every meeting (this should be high on their list of things to fix) but it\u2019s pretty easy.\nBy hiding your face from your screen, you can focus more on everyone else in the meeting.\nSecond, also free: rearrange your workspace so that light is not coming from behind you.\nThe next steps cost more in setup and money, and I\u2019ll cover them from easiest to most involved. Part of the magic of video meetings is that without a commute or fancy equipment beyond a phone or a laptop, people could join. But it\u2019s become clear that it\u2019s possible to deliver more fidelity and impact by investing in some tech.\nJust as we don\u2019t hesitate to buy a new outfit for a big meeting, or pay $500 for a plane ticket, these are investments, and in the scheme of your career, they\u2019re pretty reasonable\u2013and your boss should pay for them:\nGet some LED lights. They\u2019re incredibly cheap now (here\u2019s asample, but shop around.) Set them up to the left and right of your screen, a few feet behind it.\nGet an external DSLR camera and hook it up to your Mac or PC. This is a much bigger commitment, but the difference it makes is startling.\nYou\u2019ll need acamera, atripod, and acapture box. Again, all three have alternatives, feel free to shop around. I usethiscapture box, but your mileage may vary. (And scroll down to the end of this post for a camera alternative)\nHow it works: The camera goes on a tripod and sits just above and slightly behind your computer screen. The HDMI output goes to your capture box and then into your computer. In Zoom, change the camera from your computer to the camera. Done. It also pays to get a power cable for your camera so it doesn\u2019t run out on you. (You can add a microphone while you\u2019re at it).\nAnd then, there\u2019s one last step, which has been the biggest leap for me since the self-view insight.\nWhen you look at the camera in a zoom call, you\u2019renotlooking at the person you\u2019re talking with. You\u2019re staring over their head if you\u2019re looking at the camera, or, possibly, you\u2019re looking at them, but it appears to them that you\u2019re looking at your keyboard. Either way, there\u2019s no eye to eye connection.\nThis is unnatural. You\u2019d freak out if you had a real life meeting with someone who never made eye contact. And it\u2019s really tiring, because you end up spending your time not doing something humans evolved to do, which is look at each other.\nThe alternative? A beam splitter.\nThese are used for teleprompters. It\u2019s basically a piece of fancy glass, at an angle, on top of a monitor or screen. Behind the glass is the camera.\nYou can look directly at the glass, and the camera behind it, but instead of looking at the glass and the camera, what you\u2019re actually looking at is the teleprompter or the stuff that\u2019s on the screen.\nIt\u2019s magical.\nThis setup is now far cheaper than I expected. Here\u2019s a typicalbeamsplitterwith hood and mount, and here\u2019s amonitorthat should fit with it. Total cost under $300.\n[or if you\u2019ve already got a late-model iPhone or iPad along with a Mac, there\u2019s a new app calledReincubate Camo, which is a much better product than the name implies. It allows you to skip buying an external camera and use the device tethered to your Mac instead. You\u2019ll still need a tripod, still and you can probably make it work with the beamsplitter\u2026]\nThe entire setup, all of the things that I\u2019ve listed above, comes to less than $1,000\u2013less than half of that if you already have a camera or useCamo. If you go to a meeting a day, that\u2019s a few dollars a meeting over the course of a year.\nIt\u2019s not for everyone, but if you are looking for the tools to be more productive, I hope it helps."}]}

We were there to get mass merchants to sell our stuff\u2013getting into Target or Lechmere was a victory we needed.\nA few hours into the first show, I noticed that some of the people walking by had little creatures on their shoulders. Kraco, the low-cost stereo company, had a huge booth, and they were giving visitors these little stick-on humanoids, made of some sort of wool, to ride along on their shoulder. They were about two-inches high and they looked precisely as ridiculous as you are imagining.\nI loved this. These people, these lookers, not buyers, were identifying themselves to us from a distance. The little Kraco man on the shoulder meant, \"I am here to waste your time, I am not a professional, what will you give me that's free?\" We quickly began identifying anyone with one of these on their shoulder as a Kraco, someone not worth an investment of focus and energy or free stuff.\nAlas, the Kracos in your world today don't wear a little man on their shoulder, but that doesn't mean they're not out there.

You know it when you see it, sure, but what is it? It turns out that beauty is an important evolutionary byproduct.\nAn organism needs to invest energy in being beautiful. You won\u2019t see healthy skin on a sick animal, because maintaining a healthy coat is too \u2018expensive\u2019. A sick peacock isn\u2019t as spectacular as a healthy one. Or a genetically damaged chimp isn\u2019t going to have as symmetrical a face. As a result, most creatures evolved their definitions of beauty in a mate to match the displays of healthy creatures.\nHuman beings have adopted this signaling strategy with a vengeance. I know a woman who is going to spend more than $9,000 having her hair styled in 2009 (hey, that\u2019s less than $200 a week). Entire industries are based on human beings spending time and money in order to manufacture temporary physical beauty.\nBusinesses build lobbies that they rarely use, giant atriums with big windows and lots of empty space. It\u2019s a waste, it\u2019s expensive and it\u2019s beautiful. It\u2019s beautifulbecauseit\u2019s expensive.\nStop for a minute and think about the relationship between expense and beauty.\nDo you make something beautiful? It could be the way you write hand written letters or leave a little extra on the product, even if maybe it\u2019s not so efficient. Sometimes efficiency is beautiful, but only when it took a lot of extra effort to get there. Ordinary products are almost never beautiful. Austere products might be, but only when real effort is expended to make them that way.\nEven the most hard-hearted people are suckers for beauty. We treat people and products differently when we think they\u2019re beautiful. The reason people and organizations have invested so much in beauty over the years is that beauty pays off.\nA website that doesn\u2019t cram ads into every single nook and cranny is more beautiful\u2026 it\u2019s also more expensive to run in the short run.

Their community is the boardroom of the Fortune 1000, and they can charge a huge premium over 'geographic' providers because the product is not merely the advice they dispense.

They happily surrender market share to the commodity seller\u2013if it's a lower price you want, good luck to you! The community business says, \"people like us shop at a place like this.\" This is where brands live, and where work that matters gets done.\nThe geography-based surf shop sells surfboards and supplies to the grommets who come to this beach this weekend. The commodity surf shop sells the cheapest boards and wetsuits, online. And the community-based surf shop runs swap meets, has a newsletter, organizes competitions, commissions original artwork on boards, and yes, along the way, sells some surf wax.\nAll three structures can work, for schools, for non-profits, for companies big and small.

The other thing to think about is that thissummer, Honda is rolling out a 100 Million dollar campaign for a newcar aimed at thirty-somethings who consider themselvesadventurous/spontaneous but can\u2019t really afford something like a luxuryS.U.V. and it might be a perfect campaign to tie this light bulb into,at least it would be the perfect demographic, in terms of age.\nAlso, and this is just an idea: what if we found out what videogames are being released in the third quarter and maybe pitched theidea of having our light bulb make an appearance in the video game atsome certain level of completion; like, you get to a dark cave, let\u2019ssay, if it\u2019s an adventure game, and if you have enough points you canget the light bulb \u2013 and it would be our light bulb, obviously \u2013 andthen it\u2019s easier to see in the cave.

There are two reasons this doesn\u2019t work. First, you no longer communicate the story of \u2018special deal\u2019, instead you communicate \u2018we\u2019re in trouble.\u2019 Second, you end up chargingeveryonea lower price, even the people who were happy to pay more\u2013who wanted to pay more, in fact.\nImportant distinction: if you say to someone, \"if I give you a discount, will you buy it?\" the answer will almost certainly be no.

The craft of making a bowl or a tool or anything that created function.\nAs humans became wealthier, we could seek out the artisan, the craftsperson who would add an element of panache and style to the tools we used.\nIt's not much of a leap from the beautiful functional object to one that has no function other than to be beautiful.\nArt was born.\nWhen art collided with royalty, religion and wealth, a match was made. Those in power could use art as a way to display their resources and to insist that they also were deserving of respect for their taste and their patronage of the artistic class.\nAnd that would be the end of it, except the camera and commercial printing changed the very nature of art on canvas (and mass production changed sculpture). When anyone could have a print, or a vase, or a photo, art's position as a signifier and a cultural force was threatened.\nHence the beginning of our modern definition of art, one that so many people are resistant to. Art doesn't mean painting, art doesn't mean realistic and art doesn't mean beautiful.\nMarcel Duchamp created a ruckus with 'Fountain', which appeared in an art exhibit in 1917.\u00a0 An upside-down urinal, Duchamp was saying quite a bit by displaying it. The second person to put a urinal into a museum, though, was merely a plumber.\nAbout forty years later, Yves Klein created 'Leap Into the Void.' \u0010Long before Photoshop, he was playing with our expectations and our sense of reality.\nBetween Duchamp and Klein there were two generations of a redefinition of art. Art doesn't mean craft. And art isn't reserved for a few.\nArt is the work of a human, an individual seeking to make a statement, to cause a reaction, to connect. Art is something new, every time, and art might not work, precisely because it's new, because it's human and because it seeks to connect.\nOnce art is freed from the canvas and the dealer and the gallery, it gains enormous power. Politicians and science fiction authors can do a sort of art. Anyone liberated from the assembly line and given a job where at least part of the time they decide, \"what's next,\" has been given a charter to do art, to explore and discover and to create an impact.\nWhen I write about making 'art', many people look at me quizzically. They don't understand how to make the conceptual leap from a job where we are told what to do to a life where we decide what to do\u2013and seek to do something that connects, that makes an impact, and that yes, might not work.\nFive hundred years ago, no painter would talk to you about ideas, or even impact. Painters merely painted. Today, you don't need a brush to be an artist, but you do need to want to make change."}]}

The book industry generally ignores every innovation in tech.\nAs late as 1994, Bryant Gumbel was spending time on network TV beingbefuddledby the \u2018internet\u2019.

But they blinked.\nNew media tends to be adopted by amateurs first. And it rarely has a mass audience in the early days (because it\u2019s new). But professional content for the masses is precisely what old media stands for. As new media gains traction, the old media doubles down on what they believe to be their value, because they no longer have a monopoly on attention.\nThe editors at Encyclopedia Brittanica were proud of the control they had over every page, so they ignored Wikipedia. The producers and directors of movies love the gloss of film, so they ignored video games. And the editors of newspapers like their local hegemony so they fight against distributed content.\nSo theTimespublishesa snarky, poorly written takedown of podcasts. Not because it\u2019s based on the economic or cultural reality of today, but because their self-esteem requires there to be a chasm between all of these amateur podcasts and the few professional ones that they deign to create and publish.\nBusinesses make their own choices and suffer the consequences. The Mutual Broadcasting Network was a powerhouse in radio, but no longer. The problem is that these media businesses also narrate our cultural conversation, and that narration is historically wrong and prevents people from seeing what\u2019s possible until it\u2019s already well underway.\nThere were thousands of newspapers before there were only a few profitable ones. There are millions of YouTube creators, but only hundreds make a great living at it. And the same will be true of podcasts.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t start a podcast. You should.

Connecting effort with failure at an emotional level is crippling. After all, we've already agreed you did your best.\nEarly in our careers, we're encouraged to avoid failure, and one way we do that is by building up a set of emotions around failure, emotions we try to avoid, and emotions that we associate with the effort of people who fail. It turns out that this is precisely the opposite of the approach of people who end up succeeding.\nIf you believe that righteous effort leads to the shame of personal failure, you'll seek to avoid righteous effort.\nSuccessful people analytically figure out what didn't work and redefine what their best work will be in the future.

Marko is a great guy, but it was fascinating to watch the interactions he had with people. Every single person he met came up to him, pulled out a cellphone and began whining. Mostly, though, people didn\u2019t hate their phones. They hated their carrier.\nI know. I hate T Mobile.\nMy annoyance at my carrier didn\u2019t decrease when I had to pay not once, but twice to buy a four day online pass to use the Net in my hotel. Sitting at the airport waiting to fly home, a few shekels left on my British phone card, I decided to take a whirl and called the hard-to-find customer service number for T Mobile, figuring I\u2019d try to get a refund for the first $60 Net pass I purchased but that didn\u2019t work (Hah! I thought. Hah! I can hear you thinking).\nBob Cocksedge answered my call. On the third ring. He was intelligent, thoughtful, even kind. He apologized for taking a while, using their antiquated database. He never found the purchase, but he emailed me the contact info for his manager so I can submit the transaction number once I got my credit card info at home.\nYou\u2019ve already guessed the lesson. It only took Bob a few minutes. It didn\u2019t cost T Mobile much of anything at all compared to leaving me on hold and then being rude to me. But for a tiny tiny fraction of the cost of one of those full page ads that they buy every day, T Mobile actually built their brand.\nI\u2019ve said it before\u2013your call center is probably the single cheapest investment you can make in building your consumer or business to business brand among customers and motivated prospects.\nThanks, Bob, for reminding me."}]}

The customer or prospect is taking the time to call you. She\u2019s focused, interested, paying attention and willing to trust you.\nThink for a minute about how much you spend (and how high up in the organization the discussions go) when it\u2019s time for a new logo or a new Super Bowl ad.\nAnd yet, even though the rules have changed, the lowest-paid, least-respected, highest-turnover jobs in the organization now do the most important marketing work.\nScharffen-Berger Chocolate (which I\u2019ve featured in some of my books) was bought by Hershey three years ago. They bought it because of me (and people like me). People who will go out of their way to find high quality dark chocolate and then pay a huge premium to buy it.\nI\u2019ve been really disappointed with the quality of their product for a few months. It seems to me that in order to ramp up production, they\u2019ve smoothed out some edges and the product is becoming boring. Fewer high notes,\u00a0 less interesting. So, I called.\nThe operator, who couldn\u2019t have been nicer, offered me a coupon for a free replacement bar.\nA replacement of what? More of the same mediocre product I was calling to complain about?\nOf course, she was just doing her job, but who\u2019s fault is that? Who decided to give her nothing but a script, who decided not to take the inbound calls seriously,\u00a0 who decided that it made sense to put up a wall instead of opening a door? I guess the short version is, \"why isn\u2019t the brand manager answering the phone?\"\n\"Your call is very important to us,\"\ndoes not jibe with,\n\"Due to unusually heavy call volume.\"\nAnd the phrase, \"I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m just doing my job,\" does not match up with the marketing event of a person taking the time to call (or to email).\nNo, of course Sumner Redstone can\u2019t answer every single letter sent to Viacom. But\u2026\nShouldn\u2019t every single inbound call be answered in one ring? Shouldn\u2019t there be as much spent on self-service customer support as is spent on the design of the selling part of your website? Shouldn\u2019t you be tracking in the finest detail what people have to say when they call in? Shouldn\u2019t you be rewarding call center operators by how long they keep people on the phone, not how many calls they can handle a minute? Shouldn\u2019t there be an easy, fast and happy way for an operator to instantly upgrade a call to management (not a supervisor, I hate supervisors) who can actually learn something from the caller, not just make them go away?\nAnd I guess that\u2019s my biggest point: the goal of every single interaction should be to upgrade the brand\u2019s value in the eye of the caller and to learn something about how to do better,notto get the caller to just go away."}]}

Photographer's agents, too.Literary agents?\nThe problem with being a helpful, efficient but largely anonymous middleman is pretty obvious. Someone can come along who is cheaper, faster and more efficient. And that someone might be the customer aided by a computer.\nThe airlines don't want to pay travel agents, because the travel agents were making more money on each flight than they were. Some house sellers hesitate to pay real estate brokers because they don't believe the 6% payment is an opportunity, they see it as a tax. Investors abandoned full service stock brokers because trading stocks directly is faster and more accurate than using the phone.\nMiddlemen add value when they bring taste or judgment or trust to bear on a transaction that isn't transparent. Literary agents are crucial when publishers believe that their choice of content is essential but have too many choices and too little time. But publishers don't trust every literary agent. They trust agents they believe in. Key point:anonymous agents are interchangeable and virtually worthless.Agents that don't do anything but help one side find the other side in a human approximation of Google aren't so helpful any more.\nThink about how anonymous the typical real estate broker is. He will sell almost any house or represent almost any buyer. When selling a house, he has a fiduciary responsibility to represent that house to the best of his ability. Just like every other broker. The great real estate brokers do far more than this.\nTravel agents still survive, but in a very different way than they used to. Now, the best ones are paid by the traveler, not the airline. The best ones provide a differentiated service that is worth paying for. Instead of being middlemen, then, they are the front men, the attraction, a key asset to the traveler.\nTo thrive in a world of self-service, agents have to hyperspecialize, have to stand for something, have to have the guts to say no far more than they say yes. No, you can't publish this book. No I won't represent you. No, don't take that flight. No, I won't sell this house, it's overpriced, list it yourself.\nThe second thing agents must do to make a smart transition is to consider who they are selling to. Should talent agents only sell to Hollywood? Literary agents only to book publishers? Should ad agencies specialize in Google Adwords, not just Super Bowl spots? When markets change, agents can lead the way, not follow along grudgingly."}]}

(Key word being \"duty\".)\nIt was an extraordinary learning experience. In New York State, they\u2019ve eliminated most of the automatic exemptions, so everyone is there\u2013lawyers, doctors, sole proprietors, doesn\u2019t matter.\nThis is one of the only times you get a look at your neighbors, unguarded, unadorned, completely random.\nHere\u2019s what surprised me:1. lots of people from two parent, single income homes2. very little sense of civic pride3. complete distaste for the legal system4. widespread cynicism about insurance5. most of all, selfishness.\nI live in Westchester County, which is one of the most affluent counties in the USA. There was almost no one in the room who couldn\u2019t afford to spend the two or three days that were required of them (that\u2019s two days every six years). Yet the prevailing attitude was a wide and deep sense of self-importance. Everyone else should serve, just not me.\nOne dentist concocted an ornate story about a car accident twenty years ago\u2013and how that had soured him on the fairness of the justice system (never mind that here was his chance to make at least one trial fair!) On no less than five occasions he tried to pull strings with a judge or a lawyer or someone to be freed.\nAs I spent the entire day sitting and watching, the \"new selfishness\" really became clear. I think it goes like this:\na. in the old days, public works were public. If you contributed to a charity or acted as a volunteer, your peers noticed and you got credit for it. Respected people were respected\u2013at least partly\u2013because they gave to the community.\nb. in the last twenty years, the variety of ways to give to your community has increased dramatically. As a result, it\u2019s hard to keep track.\nc. a lot of people (respected people) have fallen through the cracks. Neighbors and peers assume that just because you\u2019re financially successful, you must also be a good citizen, even though they can\u2019t actually see that.\nd. so the selfish nature of people is rewarded\u2013work more, give less, keep the difference.\nThere in the jury room, people couldn\u2019t help but revert to type. They couldn\u2019t relax about this forced duty, to just accept it and do it gladly. So they radiated anger and distrust.\nMarketers of just about everything need to think really hard about the new selfishness. From politics to recycling to gas mileage to philanthropy to food, it feels to me like people are making decisions in a very different way than their parents did."}]}

Unaccredited, residential, free and six months long. A new way to learn about a new way of doing business.\nWe\u2019re almost done, and it has exceeded every expectation I had for it, and I think there are some broader lessons worth sharing.\nLaunch and selection:More than 48,000 people visited thepagethat described the program and 350 really cool, talented people applied. I picked 27 finalists and all of them flew out to New York to meet each other. This was the most fun I\u2019ve ever had at a cocktail party (it helped that it was at eight o\u2019clock in the morning).\nThe conversations that day were stunning. Motivated people, all with something to teach, something to learn and something to prove. I asked each person to interview as many other people as they could. After three hours, I asked everyone to privately rank their favorite choices\u2026 \u201cwho would you like to be in the program with you?\u201d\nAfter they left, I tallied up the results. It was just as you might predict: nine or ten people kept coming up over and over in the top picks. I had crowdsourced the selection, and the crowd agreed. (It turns out that the people they picked were also the people I would have picked).\nOn January 20th, the most selective (one in 40 got in) MBA program in the world got started. Since then, they\u2019ve never failed to live up to my hopes.\nIt's interesting to realize that the way I did the application process certainly changed the list of who applied. Same thing happens with jobs, I bet. Your applicants reflect your methods.\nNone of this would have worked if I was trying to manipulate the process or the people involved. My goal was easy to state and easy to live: I was there to teach (and hopefully to learn as well). The great news is that the students who appeared were beyond my wildest expectations.\nProjects:I had originally planned on having people work on some of my ongoing projects, because, just as you can\u2019t become a doctor without cutting bodies open, you can\u2019t earn really learn an MBA without running something. It turned out that the group wanted to run their own stuff, not mine, so in fact the group didn\u2019t mess with my stuff. Which was just fine.\nClay HebertandIshita Guptaare launching fear.less, a passionate free ebook on stories of overcoming fear.

If you think about it, what sort of person would actually pay money to associate with great salespeople?\nRebecca Goldstein is focusing on best practices to create onlinecommunities to help companies with support, sales, marketing andinnovation. She started the150 Projectand is alreadyworking with several companies to build their tribes.\nAl Pittampalli spent time buildingBlue Finch, a directory site on various high-interest topics.\nAlex Kruppis hostingSwagapalooza, a social media experimentauditioning companies in front of the world's most-followed bloggers.\nThere are other projects, but not online.\nLearning:The educational lesson that I found the most striking is that the book knowledge was easy to transmit and not particularly essential. Once you get this far, it's sort of a given that you're good at school. We read more than a hundred books, and the book learning happened quickly . Our culture has done an amazingly good job at teaching talented people how to learn concepts from books.\nI taught for five to twenty hours a week, and very little of it was about the books. So, if concepts from books are easy, what\u2019s hard?\nDoing it.\nPicking up the phone, making the plan, signing the deal. Pushing \u2018publish.\u2019 Announcing. Shipping.\nWe spent a lot of time on this area. Every morning, each person came in prepared to push someone in the group to overcome the next hurdle. This is what growth looks like, and it was energizing to be part of.\nWe didn\u2019t do this at all at when I was at Stanford. We spent a lot of time reading irrelevant case studies and even more time building complex financial models. The thing is, you can now hire someone to build a complex financial model for you for $60 an hour. And a week\u2019s worth of that is just about all the typical entrepreneur is going to need. The rest of the time, it\u2019s about shipping, motivating, leading, connecting, envisioning and engaging. So that\u2019s what we worked on.\nIt amazes me that MBA students around the world aren\u2019t up in arms. How can schools justify taking $100,000 in cash and teaching exactly the wrong stuff?\nAnother lesson:The Samba blogshows just a tiny portion of the writing the group did. Everyone posted every day (sometimes on that blog and sometimes on our private blog), often personal items, sometimes questions or chaff. The act of defending your work in writing became a habit, and once it was a habit, the quality of everything improved.\nAnother lesson: We used Basecamp. It\u2019s the perfect tool for coordinating this sort of work.\nAnother lesson: I kept an oversized (perhaps giant is a better word) Moleskine by the door, and we wrote down great moments and quotes as the days wore on. We\u2019ve already worked our way through it frontwards, and now we\u2019ve turned it over and are working back the other way.\nThere were some great guest lecturers as well.Derek Sivers, founder of CDBaby and David Simon, a former colleague from Yahoo both showed up.Doug Rushkoffcame by, as did designerRed Maxwell.Greg Linnfrom Columbia Records did a killer presentation about relationships as well. Stephanie Henry, who used to work in Ronald Reagan\u2019s post-Presidential office stopped by. Uber-agentStuart Krichevskycame to talk about his business as well.Michael Cadertalked to us about publishing, and Bill Godin, the world's #1 manufacturer ofhospital cribscame by for a world-class presentation.\nMegan Caseygave us both business insights and a lesson in improv, while her former boss,Adrian Zackheimgave us the inside scoop on book publishing.Jay Parkinson, who is singlehandedly reinventing medicine also stopped by, but left us with no Tamiflu.Frank Eliasongave up Tweeting for a day to share his thoughts with us as well.Dave Balter, a model entrepreneur (as opposed to a model who's an entrepreneur) had plenty of inspiring insights.\nField trips included a detailed exploration of the fabled Stew Leonard\u2019s supermarket, an engagement with maestroRoger Nierenbergat the Essex House and first-hand lesson in leaning atFahnestock State Parkon skis. We also spent a beautiful morning withSarma Melngailis at her restaurant. Food seemed to show up a lot, and I was privileged to be allowed to cook lunch for all of us a few times a week. Not to mention discovering the power of melted ginger (on rice).\nIt\u2019s surprising and disappointing that real companies don\u2019t expose their people to this sort of learning. Too busy working, I guess.\nWhile we\u2019ve covered a lot, it\u2019s pretty clear that this is a beginning for the crew, not the end.\nNext steps:Some of the people in the program are already committed to flying off to become entrepreneurs (though we all agree it might take a few cycles before it clicks.)Jonis building a practice of helping authors and book publishers use private social networks to build tribes online.\nSusan Lewis is already looking for a new gig. But instead of asking someone to hire her, she is looking to hire a boss. Her unique skill is getting things done, and she wants a place where she can exercise that power to the fullest. Check out thesusanhiresabosssite for position qualifications and to apply.\nAs for me, this has been (and it\u2019s not over yet) an extraordinary learning experience. I have no plans to do again immediately (so please don\u2019t ask and please don\u2019t apply!) but I promise that when I do something like this again, you\u2019ll read about it here first.\nHere\u2019s what I told the group, \u201cMaybe the most important thing you'll learn in this program is that you don't need this program. There's not much I'm going to tell you that's not in my blog posts or books. What this program will do is give you the structure and support to encourage you to do what you already know. But you can do that by yourselves.\u201d I think that\u2019s true for the people who weren\u2019t able to be part of it as well.\nFinal takeaways:"}]}

Would your Manolo Blahniks be as cool if everyone else were wearing Keds?\nArthur Anderson audited thousands of companies, and those audits gave us confidence in those companies, made themappearmore solid, which, not surprisingly,madethem more solid. Then, post Enron, the placebo effect disappeared. Same companies, same auditors, but suddenly those companies appeared LESS solid, which made them less solid.\nThe magic of the placebo effect lies in the fact that you can\u2019t do it to yourself. You need an accomplice. Someone in authority who will voluntarily tell you a story.\nThat\u2019s what marketers do. We have the\u201cplacebo affect.\u201d(* The knack for creating placebos.) Of course, we need to persuade ourselves that it\u2019s morally and ethically and financially okay to\u00a0 participate in something as unmeasurable as the placebo effect. The effect is controversial and it goes largely unspoken. Very rarely do we come to meetings and say, \u201cwell, here\u2019s our cool new PBX for Fortune 1000 companies. It\u2019s exactly the same as the last model, except the phones are designed by frog design so they\u2019re cooler and more approachable and people are more likely to invest a few minutes in learning how to use them, so customer satisfaction will go up and we\u2019ll sell more, even though it\u2019s precisely the same technology we were selling yesterday.\u201d\nVery rarely do vodka marketers tell the truth and say, \u201chere\u2019s our new vodka, which we buy in bulk from the same distillery that produces vodka for $8 a bottle. Ours is going to cost $35 a bottle and come in a really, really nice bottle and our ads will persuade laddies that this will help them in the dating department\u2026 nudge, nudge, know what I mean, nudge, nudge\u2026\u201d\nIt would be surprising to meet a monk or a talmudic scholar or a minister who would say, \u201cyes, we burn the incense or turn down the lights or ring these bells or light these candles as a way of creating a room where people are more likely to believe in their prayers,\u201d but of course that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re doing. (and you know what? there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.)\nIt\u2019s easier to get people to come to a meeting about clock speed and warranty failure analysis than it is to have a session about storytelling.\nWe don\u2019t like to admit that we tell stories, that we\u2019re in the placebo business. Instead, we tell ourselves about features and benefits as a way to rationalize our desire to to help our customers by allowing them to lie to themselves.\nThe design of your blog or your package or your outfit is nothing but an affect designed to create the placebo effect. The sound Dasani water makes when you open the bottle is more of the same. It\u2019s all storytelling. It\u2019s all lies.\nNot that there\u2019s anything wrong with that.\nIn fact, your marketplace insists on it."}]}

If you needed a saddle or a suitcase, they offered an extraordinary option, both elite and useful.\nOver time, they shifted gears, no longer competing on whether or not their luggage was the most useful, or their saddles the most efficient. They competed on luxury, which is a fundamentally different promise than the optimal design of a tool.\nPatagonia is still a luxury tools company. The coats they sell cost more, but some professionals choose them regardless of brand, because in addition to tribal affiliation and the placebo that comes from buying a luxury good, they're still extraordinarily functional.\nHigh end consulting and design firms also sell luxury goods. So do many conferences and elite restaurants and travel destinations. A big part of what you pay for is the story, the experience and the process, not the advice or the logotype or the learning you end up with\u2026\nOver the last year, Apple has heavily invested in the luxury component of their future. They've hired executives from Burberry and the Swiss watch industry and re-committed to their luxury-structured retail stores as well.\nThe challenge they face, the challenge you'll face if you choose to try to combine function with the top of the market, is that eventually, these two paths diverge. When Apple dumbs downPagesorKeynoteor allows openbugstofesterfor months or years, they're taking the luxury path at the expense of the tools path. Compounding the impact, when systems are upgraded, they often choose to break some of the utility and UI that their tool-using customers rely on. (When tools evolve and get more complicated, the cost of keeping the bugs out goes up. You must either choose to invest in improving the efficacy of the tool or in making it prettier/more luxurious/more popular. It's hard to do both.)\nDo we change this system font because it matches our look or because it's more efficient? Do we sell these headphones because they sound better or because they carry a powerful tribal effect? Do we fix these bugs or build something new?\nThe tension of tools/luxury sounds like this: On one hand, you might hear, \"you've lost your cachet,\" or, \"the fit and finish isn't there,\" or, \"I'm seeing the hoi polloi buying the brand at H&M and on the street, it's peaked.\" This is what happened to Uggs and to countless other brands before them. On the other hand, the tool maker fears hearing, \"your analysis isn't crisp,\" or, \"the food isn't as good as it used to be,\" or, worst of all, \"there's a new guy making something that works better.\"\nThe luxury maker doesn't really fear hearing that her food isn't cutting edge. On the other hand, she lives in fear that she won't be seen as an essential choice by the fashionable elite. And the tool maker works to avoid the opposite problem.\nThose tensions have undermined many large ad agencies recently, as they wrestle with how to help their clients do authentic social media at the same time they have to support the overhead and corporate-luxury positioning that TV enabled.\nHonda cars are tools that have been painstakingly evolved over the years to function exactly as promised. But the brand is boring and profits aren't commensurate with how well they've solved the problem they set out to solve. On the other hand, few Jimmy Choo customers complain about their inability to run a marathon in profitable high heels.\nIt's possible (but unlikely) that Apple will become the first long-term cutting-edge tool maker that simultaneously exists as a profitable luxury brand. It's unlikely that your firm will pull that off as well.\nAt some point in the evolution of every luxury brand, the users who care more about tools than about luxury begrudgingly shift away to more functional options. Not all at once, but it has always happened (so far)."}]}

And yet, they do it from their car.

Maybe demand is up, opportunities keep presenting themselves and people want to work with you.\nSo why are you so stressed out? It might be because different organizational choices lead to different paths for growth.\nConsider a house painter. His business has always been okay, but thanks to his skill and a local building boom, jobs keep showing up.\nThe traditional method: He lays out the money for paint, he does the work, he sends a bill, and soon, he gets paid.\nThe good news is that as a freelancer, he's super flexible and can withstand tough times. But in this environment, all sorts of trouble hits. First, there's a cash flow issue. New jobs mean more need for paint and materials, but he has to lay out his own cash to pay for it. Second, new jobs mean more work, but he's the best (and the cheapest) employee, so he ends up working way more hours. No cash, no time, no joy.\nAn alternative is for the painter to create a scalable system. He could require a down payment on every job, an amount calculated to cover all of his cash costs. Second, he could spend the time to build a pool of journeyman painters, a Rolodex of talent ready when he needs it. In this scenario, the painter becomes a foreman, not a painter any longer.\nOr, consider one step beyond that, in which the painter hires several foremen, each responsible for his own Rolodex. Now, the painter is a CEO, a salesperson, the architect of a brand, an organization and its growth. But that still involves a lot of risk as he scales.\nThe last structure I'll point out is the idea that the painter could refine his system and instead of dealing with homeowners, he could find partners, and license them the system. The system might include his brand name, his sales approach, a computerized, data-driven direct marketing program and most of all, a rule book that lets people who don't have his initiative enter this business. By charging every partner who joins an upfront fee (this is how franchises work) as well as a share of their income, he can grow from state to state, building a nationwide painting behemoth.\nThere's no right answer.Not everyone should run a national painting franchise business. The key insight is to feel the pain that an organizational choice leads to and fix that instead of merely chasing demand and embracing each opportunity (no matter how juicy) as it comes along.\nThe key things to focus on, I think, are:\nCash flow\nDemand enhancement\nIncreasing the ability to keep your promises by investing in a pipeline of talent\nAnd most of all, reminding yourself why you're doing this in the first place."}]}

When you rely on freelancers you can put a value on their time based on what themarket is paying. If there are six podiatrists in town, and all can heal your foot, the going rate is based on their time and effort, not on the lifetime use of your foot.\nOn the other hand, if there are no short term substitutes, then you don't pay what the market will bear, instead you pay what someone is worth. Big difference.\nConsider, for example, someone putting together a series of concerts for which they intend to sell subscriptions or even have the musicians sell tickets.\nThey could seek out pretty good musicians and imagine that paying them $500 or more per hour is very fair compensation. After all, that's more than a podiatrist gets, and she gives you back the use of your foot.\nBut when they find a linchpin, someone who will either make it easier for them to sell subscriptions or will bring an audience with them, thequestion isn't how much time it took for the musician to do her set, the question is what did shebring in terms of value, right? An indispensable person, someone with a rare asset, has few substitutes and an hourly rate makes a lot less sense.\nSo, if a musician is going to sell 300 subscriptions for you and you earn $200 a subscriptionfrom that effort, that person just added $60,000 worth of value.

He looked at the walls and said, \"I think I can work out a solution, but it will cost you $45,000 if I succeed.\" They instantly signed on, because if he succeeded, the project would be saved.\nHenry asked for a pencil and paper and wrote the name of a common hardware store chemical and handed it to them. \"Here, this will work.\" And then he billed them $45,000.

It\u2019s the dissatisfaction of knowing that something \u2018better\u2019 is available, and the invented discontent that comes from the peer pressure of being left out or left behind.\nOr it might be the social shame that comes from not having a big enough presence on social media, or the fomo that watching other people presenting nothing but happiness online can create.\nIt can be amplified with a sort of nostalgia for times when everything was perfect, or anxiety about a future when we imagine we won\u2019t have enough.\nFear of this sort of cultural distress pushes us to simply spend money to avoid it. It\u2019s easier to lose your life\u2019s savings and peace of mind to end-of-life care than it is to simply draft a living will. It\u2019s easier to give in to the high-pressure tactics of a real estate broker than it is to look squarely at the feelings that you might not actually get this particular house.

Provide keywords to generate a blog post and title."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Here are the keywords to generate a blog post: Value, Generative, Immediacy"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Title: Better than Free\nBlog: Kevin Kelly has a fantastic (no surprise) riff about free.Highly recommended.\nHis point: when there are infinite copies of something, charging for one is almost impossible.\nHere are his eight ways of making something worth charging for:\nImmediacy\u2014 Sooner or later you canfind a free copy of whatever you want, but getting a copy delivered toyour inbox the moment it is released \u2014 or even better, produced \u2014 byits creators is a generative asset. Many people go to movie theaters tosee films on the opening night, where they will pay a hefty price tosee a film that later will be available for free, or almost free, viarental or download. Hardcover books command a premium for theirimmediacy, disguised as a harder cover. First in line often commands anextra price for the same good. As a sellable quality, immediacy hasmany levels, including access to beta versions. Fans are brought intothe generative process itself. Beta versions are often de-valuedbecause they are incomplete, but they also possess generative qualitiesthat can be sold. Immediacy is a relative term, which is why it isgenerative. It has to fit with the product and the audience. A blog hasa different sense of time than a movie, or a car. But immediacy can befound in any media.\nPersonalization\u2014 A generic version of a concertrecording may be free, but if you want a copy that has been tweaked tosound perfect in your particular living room \u2014 as if it were preformedin your room \u2014 you may be willing to pay a lot.\u00a0 The free copy of abook can be custom edited by the publishers to reflect your ownprevious reading background. A free movie you buy may be cut to reflectthe rating you desire (no violence, dirty language okay). Aspirin isfree, but aspirin tailored to your DNA is very expensive. As many havenoted, personalization requires an ongoing conversation between thecreator and consumer, artist and fan, producer and user. It is deeplygenerative because it is iterative and time consuming. You can\u2019t copythe personalization that a relationship represents. Marketers call that\"stickiness\" because it means both sides of the relationship are stuck(invested) in this generative asset, and will be reluctant to switchand start over.\nInterpretation\u2014 As the old joke goes: software,free. The manual, $10,000. But it\u2019s no joke. A couple of high profilecompanies, like Red Hat, Apache, and others make their living doingexactly that. They provide paid support for free software. The copy ofcode, being mere bits, is free \u2014 and becomes valuable to you onlythrough the support and guidance. I suspect a lot of geneticinformation will go this route. Right now getting your copy of your DNAis very expensive, but soon it won\u2019t be. In fact, soon pharmaceuticalcompanies will PAY you to get your genes sequence. So the copy of yoursequence will be free, but the interpretation of what it means, whatyou can do about it, and how to use it \u2014 the manual for your genes soto speak \u2014 will be expensive.\nAuthenticity\u2014 You might be able to grab a keysoftware application for free, but even if you don\u2019t need a manual, youmight like to be sure it is bug free, reliable, and warranted. You\u2019llpay for authenticity. There are nearly an infinite number of variationsof the Grateful Dead jams around; buying an authentic version from theband itself will ensure you get the one you wanted. Or that it wasindeed actually performed by the Dead. Artists have dealt with thisproblem for a long time. Graphic reproductions such as photographs andlithographs often come with the artist\u2019s stamp of authenticity \u2014 asignature \u2014 to raise the price of the copy. Digital watermarks andother signature technology will not work as copy-protection schemes(copies are super-conducting liquids, remember?) but they can serve upthe generative quality of authenticity for those who care.\nAccessibility\u2014 Ownership often sucks. You have tokeep your things tidy, up-to-date, and in the case of digital material,backed up. And in this mobile world, you have to carry it along withyou. Many people, me included, will be happy to have others tend our\"possessions\" by subscribing to them. We\u2019ll pay Acme Digital Warehouseto serve us any musical tune in the world, when and where we want it,as well as any movie, photo (ours or other photographers). Ditto forbooks and blogs.\u00a0 Acme backs everything up, pays the creators, anddelivers us our desires. We can sip it from our phones, PDAs, laptops,big screens from where-ever. The fact that most of this material willbe available free, if we want to tend it, back it up, keep adding toit, and organize it, will be less and less appealing as time goes on.\nEmbodiment\u2014 At its core the digital copy is withouta body. You can take a free copy of a work and throw it on a screen.But perhaps you\u2019d like to see it in hi-res on a huge screen? Maybe in3D? PDFs are fine, but sometimes it is delicious to have the same wordsprinted on bright white cottony paper, bound in leather. Feels so good.What about dwelling in your favorite (free) game with 35 others in thesame room? There is no end to greater embodiment. Sure, the hi-res oftoday \u2014 which may draw ticket holders to a big theater \u2014 may migrateto your home theater tomorrow, but there will always be new insanelygreat display technology that consumers won\u2019t have. Laser projection,holographic display, the holodeck itself! And nothing gets embodied asmuch as music in a live performance, with real bodies. The music isfree; the bodily performance expensive. This formula is quicklybecoming a common one for not only musicians, but even authors. Thebook is free; the bodily talk is expensive.\nPatronage\u2014 It is my belief that audiences WANT topay creators. Fans like to reward artists, musicians, authors and thelike with the tokens of their appreciation, because it allows them toconnect. But they will only pay if it is very easy to do, a reasonableamount, and they feel certain the money will directly benefit thecreators. Radiohead\u2019s recent high-profile experiment in letting fanspay them whatever they wished for a free copy is an excellentillustration of the power of patronage. The elusive, intangibleconnection that flows between appreciative fans and the artist is worthsomething. In Radiohead\u2019s case it was about $5 per download. There aremany other examples of the audience paying simply because it feelsgood.\nFindability\u2014 Where as the previous generativequalities reside within creative digital works, findability is an assetthat occurs at a higher level in the aggregate of many works. A zeroprice does not help direct attention to a work, and in fact maysometimes hinder it. But no matter what its price, a work has no valueunless it is seen; unfound masterpieces are worthless. When there aremillions of books, millions of songs, millions of films, millions ofapplications, millions of everything requesting our attention \u2014 andmost of it free \u2014 being found is valuable.\nThe giant aggregators such as Amazon and Netflix make their living inpart by helping the audience find works they love. They bring out thegood news of the \"long tail\" phenomenon, which we all know, connectsniche audiences with niche productions. But sadly, the long tail isonly good news for the giant aggregators, and larger mid-levelaggregators such as publishers, studios, and labels. The \"long tail\" isonly lukewarm news to creators themselves. But since findability canreally only happen at the systems level, creators need aggregators.This is why publishers, studios, and labels (PSL)will never disappear.They are not needed for distribution of the copies (the internetmachine does that). Rather the PSL are needed for the distribution ofthe users\u2019 attention back to the works. From an ocean of possibilitiesthe PSL find, nurture and refine the work of creators that they believefans will connect with. Other intermediates such as critics andreviewers also channel attention. Fans rely on this multi-levelapparatus of findability to discover the works of worth out of thezillions produced. There is money to be made (indirectly for thecreatives) by finding talent. For many years the paper publication TVGuide made more money than all of the 3 major TV networks it \"guided\"combined. The magazine guided and pointed viewers to the good stuff onthe tube that week. Stuff, it is worth noting, that was free to theviewers.\u00a0 There is little doubt that besides the mega-aggregators, inthe world of the free many PDLs will make money selling findability \u2014in addition to the other generative qualities."}]}

It is.\nThe second argument that makes no sense is, \"how will this new business model support the world as we know it today?\"\nWho cares if it does? It is. It's happening. The world will change around it, because the world has no choice. I'm sorry if that's inconvenient, but it's true.\nAs I see 'free', there are two forces at work:\nIn an attention economy (like this one), marketers struggle for attention and if you don't have it, you lose. Free is a relatively cheap way to get attention (both at the start and then through viral techniques).\nSecond, in a digital economy with lots of players and lower barriers to entry, it's quite natural that the price will be lowered until it meets the incremental cost of making one more unit. If a brand can gain share by charging less, a rational player will.\nConde Nast (publisher of theWired(Chris's magazine) and yes, theNew Yorker(Malcolm's magazine)),\u00a0 is going to go out of business long before you get sick, never mind die. So will newspapers printed on paper. They're going to disappear before you do. I'm not wishing for this to happen, but by refusing to build new digital assets that matter, traditional publishers are forfeiting their future.\nMagazines and newspapers were perfect businesses for a moment of time, but they wouldn't have worked in 1784, and they're not going to work very soon in the future either.\nWe're always going to need writers, but the business model of their platform is going to change.\nPeople will pay for contentifit is so unique they can't get it anywhere else, so fast they benefit from getting it before anyone else, or so related to their tribe that paying for it brings them closer to other people. We'll always be willing to pay for souvenirs of news, as well, things to go on a shelf or badges of honor to share.\nPeople will not pay for by-the-book rewrites of news that belongs to all of us. People will not pay for yesterday's news, driven to our house, delivered a day late, static, without connection or comments or relevance. Why should we? A good book review on Amazon is more reliable and easier to find than a paid-for professional review that used to run in your local newspaper, isn't it?\nLike all dying industries, the old perfect businesses will whine, criticize, demonize and most of all, lobby for relief. It won't work. The big reason is simple:\nIn a world of free, everyone can play.\nThis is huge. When there are thousands of people writing about something, many will be willing to do it for free (like poets) and some of them might even be really good (like some poets). There is no poetry shortage.\nThe reason that we needed paid contributors before was that there was only economic room for a few magazines, a few TV channels, a few pottery stores, a few of everything. In world where there is room for anyone to present their work, anyone will present their work. Editors become ever more powerful and valued, while the need for attention grows so acute that free may even be considered expensive.\nOf course, it's ironic that sometimes people pay money for my books (I view them as souvenirs of content you could get less conveniently and less organized for free online if you chose to). And it's ironic that I read Malcolm's review for free. And ironic that you can read Chris's arguments the most cogently by paying for them. [Update:you can chime in hereand see what's being said around the web as well.]\nNeatness is for historians.For a long time, all the markets for attention-based goods are going to be messy, which means that there are going to be huge opportunities for people (like you?) able to get that most precisous asset (our attention) for free.

In other words, there must be a reason for that line.\nStew Leonard\u2019s, a mere shell of its former glory as a groundbreaking supermarket, was so crowded that it was literally impossible to push the cart.

And the main reason, the best I could tell, was precisely because of how crowded it was. I know that I fell for it\u2013I needed some fish for a party and told myself the story that it would be fresher there because of Stew\u2019s volume. The person in front of me grabbing strawberries like they were scarce certainly agreed\u2013even though they were precisely the same price as the market down the street.\nLater, watching the party people lining up for a 2 pm brunch in New York\u2026 I don\u2019t think it was an accident that people chose the source for their eggs benedict largely on how crowded the cafe was. A few places had huge lines. Some places had none. The menus seems awfully similar\u2026 and how different could the pancakes be?

To get it on the radar, and to have people devote time, resources and behavior change to address it.\nHuman beings in our culture are wired to pay attention to problems that are:\nVisible\u2013right in front of our eyes, not microscopic or far away.\nNon-chronic\u2013rationalization is our specialty, and the reason we learn to rationalize is so that we don\u2019t go insane when faced with long-term, persistent issues. We bargain them down the priority list.\nSymptomatic\u2013this is a version of \u2018visible\u2019. If the problem has symptoms, and the symptoms are painful and getting worse, you have our attention. Symptoms that are stable or getting better feel much less urgent.\nPainful\u2013some problems have symptoms that aren\u2019t so bad. And so we ignore them.\nIn our control\u2013because helplessness is a feeling most people seek to avoid. The more certain the potential solution, the more likely it is people will acknowledge that there\u2019s a problem.\nKeep us from feeling stupid\u2013because we don\u2019t like feeling stupid, so we\u2019d rather ignore the problem.\nStatus-driven\u2013this one might be surprising. It turns out we like to focus our attention on things that will move us up the social hierarchy.\nExpensive\u2013problems that cost us money right now are ideal for this culture, because expensive = urgent.\nSolvable\u2013see that earlier riff about rationalization and chronic problems. If a problem doesn\u2019t seem solvable, we\u2019re a lot less likely to stake our attention on it.\nThis explains why cigarette smoking among the youth took so long to (partly) extinguish. It was a high-status activity, with no real symptoms for decades. It\u2019s not painful and the visible side effects (thanks to billions of dollars in culture-bending spending by the tobacco companies) were seen as positive by many who participated. While the anti-smoking cause was definitely helped by the weight of evidence and persistent efforts by the medical community, it was higher taxes and enforced smoking areas that turned the tide. They made the problem expensive and a little shameful. People who didn\u2019t want to look stupid or feel poor didn\u2019t smoke.\nOther problems that have a similar set of problems: Selling pre-need funerals. Addressing climate change. Balancing the budget. Bringing your kids to be vaccinated. Getting out of personal debt. Learning science and math. River blindness somewhere else\u2026\nIf you\u2019re working to sell a problem to your public, it\u2019s tempting indeed to point out how shockingly irrational all of the instincts above are in practice. More effective, though, is to remarket your problem with a story that resonates."}]}

Magazine editors don't spend a lot of time wishing for better technology. Opera singers focus more on their singing than on microphone technologies. Novelists proudly use typewriters.\nSure, there are exceptions like Les Paul (who developed the electric guitar) and Mitch Miller (who invented reverb) but these exceptions prove the rule: often, culture is invented by people who are too busy to seek out new technology.\n(The bottom left corner of the grid shows the tech-phobic culture-phobic contingent. Not relevant to this discussion so much, but scary nonetheless).\nIf you take a look at this chart, you can see the danger anyone who introduces new technology faces. While you'll attract Les Paul and the 37Signals guys, you're more likely to attract spammers, scammers, opportunity seekers and others that will bring our culture down as easily as they'll bring it up.\nThe challenge is in designing structures and transparency that will attract the good guys while burying or repelling those that seek the new technology (because they can't find anywhere else to go). In other words, you either need to move the top left to the top right (not easy, but possible*), or educate the bottom left of the grid in how to contribute to the culture (really difficult indeed). The best new media (like blogs and possibly twitter) open doors to people who didn't used to have a voice. The worst ones (like blogs and possibly twitter) merely create new venues for scams and senseless yelling.\n*The much-anticipated folding of Gourmet magazine is proof of what happens when the top left refuses to move right.

Publishing a great book successfully is quite difficult. Launching a non-profit that matters is a Herculean task. I hope you will do all three, and more, often.\nBut while your intent is pure and your goal is to create magic, the most common mistake is to believe that the marketplace will agree with your good intent and support you. More specifically, that media intermediaries will clearly, loudly and accurately tell your story, that this story will be heard by an eager and interested public and that the public will take action (three strikes).\nOr, more tempting, that ten people will tell ten people to the eighth power, leading to truly exponential growth (some day). Because right now, you've told ten people and they have told no one.\nOr, possibly, that you will call on businesses and offer them a solution so powerful that they will pay you at that very first meeting, generating enough cash flow that you will be able to immediately hire more (and better) salespeople to grow your organization exponentially.\nAll great organizations make change. Change is hard. Change takes time. In markets that matter (meaning not gossip, not snark, not spectator sports), people rarely tell dozens of other people about what they've discovered. And action is taken, sometimes, but not as much as you deserve.\nNo, you'll need to work hard to create something magical, and a big part of that hard work is relentlessly eliminating all magical thinking from your projections and your expectations of how the market will react.\nOnly count on things that have happened before, a funnel you can buy and time you can afford to invest.

How do I license this great idea?\nBlog: A. Well, it depends.\nIt\u2019s a classic story: basement inventor dreams up an idea, a product, a concept for a movie or even a new slogan for a company. He\u2019s sure, certain, positive, that the idea, in the right hands, has huge legs. And it\u2019s the idea that matters, right?\n\"This fishing lure is dramatically better than what\u2019s out there.\"\"This swoosh logo is really dramatic.\"\"This promotion for a bar in town will make them a huge amount of money.\"\"If I could just get Mark Burnett to listen to this idea for a Survivor sequel\u2026\"\nAnd most of the time, you\u2019re right. Your better UI/software/conceptwouldmake more money in the right hands.\nThis disconnect drives people, especially engineers, crazy. The processes of improvement and ideation demand that you take things that aren\u2019t so good and make them better. If someone has go to market power or even better, sales and influence power, then why wouldn\u2019t they want to improve?\nThe problem is this: 99% of the time, they don\u2019t.\nIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re stupid. It\u2019s just that they\u2019re not organized to turn your big idea into something that actually works.\nThey don\u2019t have someone on staff who will get promoted for finding you.They don\u2019t have a team on staff who can develop your idea and get it out the door.\nThere are exceptions (book publishers, for example, are good at publishing new books). But most of the time, that\u2019s not the business they are in. They are in the business of doing their job, and their job rarely includes taking the time (and the risk) of hunting for new big ideas outside the organization.\nFirst,there\u2019s the huge problem of NDAs and being accused of stealing stuff. If you want me to keep something a secret, and you won\u2019t tell me the secret before I sign a piece of paper, my risk is huge. On the other hand, if you tell me an idea (almost always non-protected) before I sign the paper, why sign it? Big paradox.\nSecond,there\u2019s the problem of what it\u2019s worth. What is the basic idea behindStar TrekorMission: Impossibleworth? Would a different two-paragraph treatment really have made the difference between success or failure? The producers of those shows would tell you it was the 10,000 little things that happenedafterthe original idea that made the difference between success and failure.\nIn other words, it\u2019s how you tell it.\nIf you think your idea is worth a lot, and the producer of the product (whether it\u2019s a widget or a business process) points out how many choices she has and how little the original idea is worth\u2013you guys are stuck.\nTrue story: I helped invent the first fax board for the Mac. Pitched it to a dozen companies. No one nibbled. Apple launched it soon after seeing ours, and the product quickly became a low-profit commodity. I\u2019m confident that if we had created a substantial organization and built a marketing aura and system around the product, it would have worked. The idea itself\u2026 nah.\nJust because you\u2019re a good cook doesn\u2019t mean you should run a restaurant. And a restaurant that succeeds rarely does because they have special recipes. All the recipes in the world are free online. That\u2019s not what makes a restaurant (or a business, for that matter) work."}]}

That\u2019s becausea. more and more will find the hotlists in places other than their siteandb. people reading the hotlist are unlikely to be swayed by an ad.\nThink about reading the Billboard charts or the Amazon bestseller list. That\u2019s a very goal-directed activity, and the goal isn\u2019t necessarily to find something that\u2019s NOT a bestseller. People skip the ads on the bestseller page, but read the ads in the classified section.\nBut that\u2019s just fine too.\nThe reason?\nThird:the Diggers, the posters, the surfers\u2026 these are very highly-leveraged people. Call them the Legion of Super Surfers. Okay, bad acronym, maybe not. Call them the league of the leading edge.\nThe leading edge has always been important. Now, though, since they have a megaphone, since Digg and the others are amplifying their movements, they are far, far more important than ever before.\nAnd that\u2019s Digg\u2019s asset.They have aggregated the league.\nSo what now?\nGet permission.\nGet permission to fead the League tidbits about the future. The reason they are Diggers is that they like being first, they like discovering cool stuff and then sharing it. So organize that process and monetize it.\nHere\u2019s what I would do (two alternatives)\n1. Say to every Digger: here\u2019s our FirstLook RSS feed (or sign up by email). Every two days, we send you a link to an article, a new product, a political idea\u2013whatever topic you tell us you love.\nThen, go to the teeming masses of marketers out there and invite them to nominate their new ideas, their new posts, their new sites to your editor. The editor picks the ones that are good enough, that make the cut. Figure three or ten or a hundred a day, depending on the demand. Once demand goes up, charge $20 just to submit one, so the editor can hire a squadron of assistants.\nAlert the marketers that have something worth of distribution. Let the others down easy. Now, let the ones that qualify bid against each other. High bidder gets first billing, top five bidders make the list.\nAlert the 500 or the 5,000 or the 50,000 Diggers that signed up. They see a list of things that might be tomorrow\u2019s big news. Theydiggthe ones they love. Marketers save millions and months. Digg makes a fair profit and becomes a key powerbroker in the launch of the new. Diggers who choose to get to see a commercial glimpse of tomorrow (the same way reporters choose to look at press releases from the right media outlets).\n2. The other alternative could happen tomorrow. Build a Squidoo lens or a blog for Legion members. Figure out how to assemble a thousand or even 200 like-minded diggers. Have them sign up and give you their email address. Use the RSS feed of the lens to keep your members up to date. Now, instead of finding readers for your \"ads\", you find ads for your readers. Every day or two, your post goes out to your members. Every day or two, you make a hundred or a thousand or ten thousand dollars from someone who had a story worthy of being distributed.\nObviously, neither approach works if you sell out. Neither approach works the minute you stop representing the interests of the League. Take a lot from Zenith or Quasar to push some lame device and you fail.\nIt\u2019s pretty clear to me that this is the moment to build an asset like this one, one that could last for a long, long time (maybe even five years!)."}]}

Having a price war counts as well. Linkbait is on that list as well.\nShort-term architecture means putting up a cheap building, a local eyesore, something that saves money now instead for building something for the long haul. The guys who put up the Pantheon in Rome weren't doing short-term anything. Hard to say that about a big box store.\nShort-term manufacturing ignores the side effects of pollution, bad design and worker impact because it's faster money in the short run to merely make the product (and the sale) in the most direct way possible.\nShort-term investment banking invests in transactions that are unsustainable and eventually blow up (after commissions are paid).\nShort-term sales involve spamming as many people as you can, as fast as you can.\nShort-term hiring requires you to hire cheap, train as little as possible and live with turnover.\nBernie Madoff was a short-term capitalist, of course.\nLeft to their own devices, (particularly during difficult economic times) too many people misunderstand the essence of capitalism, and rationalize a do what it takes mindset that is ultimately self-defeating. The reason we need the SEC, the EPA, transparent operations, a free press that cares about its mission and people willing and able to speak up is that they make it expensive to choose the short-term option.\nThe short-term capitalist is betting that someone else will clean it up.\nOne of the worst things you can call a business person, I think, is a short-term capitalist. He selfishly takes for now and fails to contribute in return.\nThe internet has opened two doors. First, it's easier than ever to do the short-term thing, anonymously if you choose, with a big splash, internet ads, eBay scams and more. On the other hand, since there's a revolution going on, it's also easier than ever to build something that matters, something that lasts.\nThe thing to remember about the short-term is that we'll almost certainly be around when the long-term shows up."}]}

All fromSmall is the New Big.Blog readers are far more likely to be askedfor their input than the average employee. You\u2019re frequently requiredto approve, improve, and adjust things that are about to become real.And yet, if you\u2019re like most people, you\u2019re pretty bad at it.\nIn the interest of promoting your career, making your day at workmore fun, improving the work life of your colleagues, and generallymaking my life a whole lot better, I\u2019d like to give you some feedbackon giving feedback. As usual, the ideas are simple\u2013it\u2019s doing themthat\u2019s tricky.\nThe first rule of great feedback is this: No one cares about your opinion.\nI don\u2019t want to know how you feel, nor do I care if you would buyit, recommend it, or use it. You are not my market. You are not myfocus group.\nWhat I want instead of your opinion is your analysis. It does me nogood to hear you say, \"I\u2019d never pick that box up.\" You can add a greatdeal of value, though, if you say, \"The last three products thatsucceeded were priced under $30. Is there a reason you want to pricethis at $31?\" Or, \"We analyzed this market last year, and we don\u2019tbelieve there\u2019s enough room for us to compete. Take a look at thisspreadsheet.\" Or even, \"That font seems hard to read. Is there a way todo a quick test to see if a different font works better for ouraudience?\"\nAnalysis is a lot harder than opinion because everyone is entitledto his or her own taste (regardless of how skewed it might be). Afaulty analysis, however, is easy to dismantle. But even though it\u2019sscary to contribute your analysis to a colleague\u2019s proposal, it\u2019s stillabsolutely necessary.\nThe second rule? Say the right thing at the right time.\nIf you\u2019re asked to comment on a first-draft proposal that willeventually wind its way to the chairman\u2019s office, this is not the timeto point out that \"alot\" is two words, not one. Copyediting thedocument is best done just once, at the end, by a professional. Whileit may feel as if you\u2019re contributing something by making commentsabout currently trivial details, you\u2019re not. Instead, try to figure outwhat sort of feedback will have the most positive effect on the finaloutcome, and contribute it now.\nFar worse, of course, than the prematurely picky comment is theway-too-late deal-breaker remark. If I\u2019ve built a detailed plan for anew factory in Hoboken, New Jersey (and negotiated all the variancesand integrated the existing landscaping), the time to tell me you werethinking of relocating the plant to Secaucus was six months ago, notthe night before the groundbreaking.\nThe third rule? If you have something nice to say, please say it.\nI\u2019ve been working with someone for about a year, and in that entiretime, he\u2019s never once prefaced his feedback with, \"This was a reallyterrific piece of work,\" or \"Wow! This is one of the best ideas I\u2019veheard in a while.\" Pointing out the parts you liked best is much morethan sugarcoating. Doing so serves several purposes. First, it puts youon the same side of the table as me, making it more likely that yourconstructive criticism will actually be implemented. If you can startby seeing the project through my eyes, you\u2019re more likely to analyze(there\u2019s that word again) the situation in a way that helps me reach mygoals. \"I think it\u2019s great that you want to get our quality ratings up.Let\u2019s see whether the added people you say this initiative requires arereally necessary, and whether beginning your report with staffing needsis the best way to get this past senior management.\"\nSecond, it makes it so much more likely that I will come to you forfeedback in the future. It\u2019s easy to interpret the absence of positivefeedback as the absence of any sort of approval or enthusiasm. Finally,being nice to people is fun.\nIf I haven\u2019t intimidated you with my other rules, here\u2019s the last one: Give me feedback, no matter what.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if I ignored your feedback last time (maybe that\u2019sbecause you gave me your opinion, not an analysis). It doesn\u2019t matterif you\u2019re afraid your analysis might ultimately be a little shaky. Itdoesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re the least powerful person in the room. Whatmatters is that you\u2019re smart; you understand something about theorganization, the industry, and the market; and your analysis (at thevery least) could be the kernel of an idea that starts me down atotally different path."}]}

The French word \u201cclich\u00e9\u201d comes from the sound madewhen the matrix is dropped into molten metal tomake a printing plate.\nTo save time and money, then, printers took common phrases and re-used the type.\nAlong the way, they trained us to understand the image, the analogy, the story. Hear it often enough and you remember it. That training has a useful purpose. Now, you can say 'Festivus' or 'There is no I in team\u2026\" or \"that took real courage\" when describing a golf shot, and we immediately get it. Monty Python took a clich\u00e9 about theSpanish Inquisitionand made it funny by making it real.

Apple does this all the time. They point out the clich\u00e9 of a laptop or a desktop or an MP3 player and then they turn it upside down. Richard Branson takes the expected boredom of a CEO and turns it upside down by doing things you don't expect.\nI often use theEncyclopedia of Clich\u00e9sto find clich\u00e9s that then inspire opposites.

Each day, Megan picked someone who was wearing the shirt and gave that person $9,000 worth of ads on Squidoo.\nWithin an hour, you saw orange t-shirts on the show floor. By the second day, every single t-shirt was taken and more than 5% of all the people there were wearing the shirts.\nTotal cost: $3,000. (plus the ads).\nThis obviously doesn\u2019t work at every trade show. You need both an audience that\u2019s into playful promotionanda suitable and appropriate prize to reward the t-shirt wearer. Since this was self-referential (Having people build Squidoo pages about you is a lot like getting them to wear a t-shirt about you) it was easy for us to do, but it occurs to me that there are much broader applications of this technique. Hey, it even worked for radio stations all the years I was growing up. Stations used to offer a cash prize if they found your car and you had the bumper sticker.

It was computer technology (particularly Apple) that put typography into the hands of all of us.

Never once set out with money in their pockets to see what's new, to experience the feeling of, \"maybe I'll buy that,\" or, \"I wonder how that will look on me\u2026\"\nShopping is an entertaining act, distinct from buying.\nShopping is looking around, spending time in search of choosing how to spend money. Shopping is buying something you've never purchased before.\nFor many people, shopping is nothing but a risk. The risk that one might buy the wrong thing, waste money, waste time, become indebted. For many, replenishment, buying what your parents bought, getting enough to live on\u2026 that's all there is, that's enough.\nIf we're going to shop, then, there's an imperative to make it engaging, thrilling and worth the resources we put into it. The shopping mall (what aconcept) is less than a hundred years old, and in the States anyway, they're not building many more of them.\nShopping on the internet is pushing this dichotomy. The idea of subscribing to household goods (like razors and soap) eliminates the chore of shopping and makes buying automatic. On the other hand, Kickstarter wants nothing to do with needs and with replenishment\u2013the entire site is about the thrill of shopping, with meaning and stuff intermingled.\nIn a culture dominated by consumerism, it's our shopping choices that consistently alter\u00a0our world."}]}

The audio and other details arehere.\n\nI was driving through a developing country in the Caribbeannear the water, and I passed a device I\u2019d never seen before, which is agas-powered sugar cane juice extractor.And it looks like one of those things they put trees in after astorm.And they put sugar cane inand out the bottom comes sugar juice.\n\nSothe question is, if you\u2018re the only guy on the island who has one of thesemachines, who has the power?Obviously, you do.Thesugar cane growers have only two choices: grow sugar cane, or don\u2019t grow sugarcane.But if they grow sugar cane,they have to sell it to you because there\u2019s nobody else who has the machine,which means that you will pay them as little as you can as long as they keepgrowing it.And you will extractall the profit from selling that to the people who need it.\n\nNow,what happens when three new machines come to the island?And now there are four people who havethe sugar cane processing machine.Who has the power?Thepower has shifted, hasn\u2019t it?Youhave very little power.You are acommodity processor.The sugarcane growers still don\u2019t have that much power because their choices are onlygrow it or don\u2019t grow it, but the price they\u2019re going to get is going to go upa bit, because other people can bid for it.\n\nButbasically, the power mostly shifts to that consumer who doesn\u2019t care which kindof sugar cane juice they buy, and so you\u2019re going to have to sell it cheap ifyou want to get market share.\n\nThenone of the guys who has the machine stops making ordinary sugar canejuice.He starts treating thegrowers better and encouraging them to not use pesticides.Now his \u2013 he\u2019s organic.He starts treating the customersbetter, delivering more reliably in packaging that\u2019s more suitable to what theyneed.He invests all sorts of wayto use sugar cane and process sugar cane and come up with clever sugar caneproducts.He connects to peoplewho buy sugar cane and the restaurateurs and the chefs and things so they canwork with each other to do better stuff with his organic sugar cane and theypay more for it.\n\nWhowins now?And the answer obviouslyis the customers, the organic growers, and the guy who\u2019s an artist when itcomes to using his machine.Asopposed to people who just say, \u201cI just follow the manual.\u201dAnd the lesson, of course, is that noweverybody has a sugar cane machine, that now, anybody who wants to makesomething over and over again, is going to be competing against other peoplewho want to make something over and over again.There is no competence shortage.And if all you have is competence to offer, why on earthwill we pay you extra?\n\nSoif you\u2019re a machinist, making a widget that goes in a 747, congratulations forhaving a good union.Both overtime, intelligent people \u2013 capitalists \u2013 will buy that widget from someone whowill sell it to them for one tenth of the price.\n\nBecause if all it is is a widget, just like every otherwidget, just buy the cheap one.They\u2019re all the same.Ifall you are is a replaceable cog in the system that makes the widgets, andthere are a hundred people as competent as you around the world, you might getaway from it for a little while, but you\u2019re not going to get away with it inthe long run.\n\nAndthat is the challenge.So beforewe go into the six elements that I think we need to focus on when we\u2019reteaching people about this, I want to talk about something that I saw \u2013 Ivisualized \u2013 just yesterday, that I help really help you see what a Potemkinvillage, what a fa\u00e7ade we\u2019ve been living in.\n\nSevenhundred years ago, no one was unemployed.The idea of being unemployed was totally alien. The idea of a job ispretty brand new.And there arecountries today where people don\u2019t have jobs and don\u2019t consider themselvesunemployed.That was put onus.\n\nHow did that happen?Here\u2019s what happened.Twohundred years ago, people invented machines \u2013 three hundred years ago, hundredand fifty years ago \u2013 the industrial age really kicked into power.What he machine does is it allows theperson who owns the machine \u2013 like the sugar cane processing machine \u2013 allowsthe person who owns the machine to get an enormous upside because it helpstheir productivity.\n\nBut if you own the machine, you know what you need?You need people to run it.And that means you need to sell theworld on having a job.And itturns out that wasn\u2019t that easy.\n\nClay Shirky has talked about an author who\u2019s pointed thatgin was one of the key elements of the industrial revolution.That two generations, thirty years,people were drunk all day long.That if you went to Manchester, England, you\u2019d see all the guys workingin the mills and you\u2019d see a guy pushing a cart.\n\nI have a picture of one \u2013 a guy pushing a cart thatdispensed gin all day long.Because this act of saying you have to go, move to a new place, walkinto a dark building, spend 12 hours there doing what you\u2019re told and then gohome was alien.\n\nSo you needed to have people to do jobs.Why?Why would you do a job?I know, so you could have money.What do you need money for?So you can buy stuff.That was new, too.Therefore,most people the act of buying stuff was not a thing you spent a lot of timethinking about or doing.You hadthe things that you needed and every once in a while you\u2019d have to fix them orreplace them, but you didn\u2019t go to the mall on Saturday.That was all brand new.That was invented by the people who hadfactors that made stuff that they wanted to sell you.\n\nWhy buy stuff?Peer pressure.Keeping upwith the Joneses.That once peoplearound you have stuff, you want more stuff. And if you look at charts ofhappiness by culture, we see that there\u2019s no correlation between stuff andhappiness.In fact, there\u2019s areverse correlation because if lots of people in your culture have stuff, youmight be unhappy because you don\u2019t have as much stuff as they do.Apologies to George Carlin.\n\nIt gets even worse because sometimes someone who might beworking would say, \u201cI have enough stuff.\u201dAnd they\u2019d stop working.Soyou know what we invented?Debt.Debt has two reallygood uses when you\u2019re talking about consumers.Use number one is that you can sell people more stuff whenthey don\u2019t even have money.\n\nUse number two is once they buy the stuff, they have to goto work because otherwise, debt will take all the stuff away.So that amplifies it even further,which leads to more compliance, more people doing the job, so that the factorythe machines works better, and then to cap it all off, we have school.\n\nAnd school is 12 years of publically-financed brainwashingto teach people to be compliant to get them really good at taking notes, reallygood at following instructions, and in fact, when you get to work \u2013 and this isimportant \u2013 when you get to work, pretty much the only skill you use that youlearned at school is compliance.You don\u2019t use geometry, you don\u2019t use conjugating verbs in Latin \u2013 godown the list of all the things you spent all those hours working on in school\u2013 you don\u2019t use any of them.\n\nWhat you use is you got really good at being compliant anddoing a job \u2013 at doing your work because \u2013 that doing your job \u2013 because theytold you you have to do it.\n\nOkay.So thissystem got put into place.And nowpeople are showing up, people like me, and we\u2019re saying, \u201cWait a minute, JerryWeintraub is the future, not that person on American Airlines.\u201dWe don\u2019t have a compliance shortage.\n\nThe United States isn\u2019t struggling economically latelybecause we\u2019re not obedient enough.The reason for the struggle is there aren\u2019t enough people acting likeJerry Weintraub.There aren\u2019tenough people who are looking at a situation where there is no map, where thereis no way to know for sure what to do next and doing things that matter.Why is that?\n\nAside from the brainwashing, aside from the debt, aside fromthe system, I think a big reason is the following: you\u2019re not as good as youthink you are.When I say that toyou \u2013 you\u2019re not as good as you think you are \u2013 my guess is that if you\u2019re abreathing human being, I struck a nerve.No one wants to be told that.And in fact, I didn\u2019t say it to you, I said it in quotes.Someone else was saying that toyou.\n\nWe live in fear \u2013 petrified \u2013 that someone\u2019s going to say tous, \u201cYou know what, Bob/Jack/Jill/Sue?You\u2019re not as good as you think you are.Who do you think you are, acting like this?Who gave you the authority?Who gave you the permission to go dothat thing that\u2019s not written down?Where\u2019s your deniability?Where\u2019s you excuse?How canyou possibly justify what you did?You\u2019re not nearly as good as you think you are.\u201d\n\nBut no one ever says that to us.We just worry that they\u2019re going to say that.And the worry gets amplified by school,by spouses, by in-laws, by debt, by the system, by the media \u2013 that\u2019s whatwe\u2019re worried about because it\u2019s brought out large.Someone does some small misbehavior during a speech duringthe Academy Awards and we go, \u201cOh my God, that could\u2019ve been me, everyonewould\u2019ve made fun of me.\u201d\n\nOkay, so let me talk about the six reasons why I think thisis hard for people and what we need to do to train them to think about it.The first one \u2013 the one I\u2019ve sort ofwarmed up with so far today \u2013 is they don\u2019t necessarily understand what\u2019s atstake.That I needed to spend halfthe book \u2013 the first of Linchpin \u2013 explaining the change.\n\nI couldn\u2019t just say \u201cthat\u2019s a given\u201d in one page and spendthe rest of the book on the other stuff.Because if we don\u2019t make it clear to people what\u2019s at stake, if it\u2019s notmore scary to ignore that than to ignore the current fear, we\u2019ll just live withthe current fear, thanks very much, the current fear\u2019s just fine with me.That change often gets made when we seethat what was on the table matters.\n\nThe second thing is the entire capitalist system I describedto you does not include the word generosity.The mindset of generosity is \u201cI need to give something tosomeone and get nothing in return.\u201dWe don\u2019t teach very much of that.We don\u2019t have very many examples of people who are good at that.We are not trained to do that, but youcan\u2019t do the work that I\u2019m talking about unless you\u2019re prepared to be generous.Generous is spirit, generous insubstance, generous in behavior, generous in the way you\u2019re sharing yourheart.\n\nThe third thing is recognizing that anyone can do this.Because the lizard brain \u2013 the voice inthe back of our head \u2013 might say that some people can do it, but youcan\u2019t.It\u2019s really good at sayingthat and there\u2019s a good reason for it because if you believe you can\u2019t do it,you\u2019re not on the hook to do it, and if you\u2019re not on the hook to do it, you\u2019resafe.\n\nSmart people have a really hard time with this.Some of the email I\u2019ve been getting isstunning to me.\u201cAre you saying\u201dthey say, \u201cthat anyone is capable of having a ____ idea?\u201d \u2013 whatever onethey\u2019re talking about \u2013 \u201care you saying that it doesn\u2019t matter what countryyou\u2019re from or what race you are or what your parents did for a living, thatit\u2019s possible to do original, interesting, generous work?\u201dYes, I am.\n\nNo, there\u2019s no chance I will ever be a professional pingpong player.Or golfer or cricketplayer or even be good at spreadsheets because it\u2019s too late.But I\u2019m also saying that when you werefour, you did something amazing that was an act of genius that no one had everdone before.And when you were sixor even eight you did it.\n\nBut then somewhere along the way, you decided that peoplemight say you don\u2019t have the right to do that.Or they might laugh at your or they might say that you didit wrong and bad things happen.And it\u2019s easier to just not undo it because all the other parts of thesystem \u2013 the debt and the school and the compliance and the factor and the joband the business school and the resume and the HR people \u2013 have reinforced thismodel that says your job is to do your job and we have no problem at allrewarding people for doing their job.\n\nWe try to reward them with money because it\u2019s safer and lesspersonal.But we don\u2019t have anyreal problem with it.And when westart talking about rewarding people for getting in touch with the fact thatthey\u2019re actually a genius, it starts feeling really touchy feely.That didn\u2019t use to be that way.But we invented this whole construct ontop of it.\n\nThe next one is acknowledging the fact that you have alizard brain.A physical part ofyour brain whose job it is to make you scared.Whose job it is to have you back off.A Steve Pressfield calls it, \u201ctheresistance.\u201dThe voice of thelizard is the resistance.It isreal; we can see it on a functional MRI scan of the brain.\n\nIt is not difficult at all to trigger.There\u2019s a lot of thinking about what wedo when it gets triggered, but one thing I will tell you is it always tastesthe same.It always feels thesame. There may be a thousand reasons the resistance doesn\u2019t want to dosomething \u2013 there may be a hundred things the lizard brain doesn\u2019t want you todo \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t have a large vocabulary, so when any of them show up, italways feels the same.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a shy person, whether you\u2019reabout to meet a really important executive or just someone at a cocktail party\u2013 the same feeling is in the back of your head about what could go wrong.That\u2019s proof that this cycle is there \u2013it\u2019s organic, it\u2019s real.\n\nWe have to acknowledge it and figure out what we\u2019re going todo about it as opposed to just pretending that there\u2019s this little man in ourhead who makes all the decisions because if we\u2019re going to be in charge of whatwe do next, we\u2019re going to have to understand the geometry of that.\n\nTwo more.Stevealso gave me this great expression called \u201cturning pro.\u201dWhat that means is that there\u2019s adifference between amateurs who are muddling their way through, doing what theyfeel like, looking for inspiration, and maybe doing good work.And professionals who show up and dothe work.\n\npro golferpractices even if it\u2019s cold and rainy.A pro psychologist is able to empathize with a patient even when theydon\u2019t feel like it.That a protrainer or coach is able to do the work and have the difficult conversationbecause it\u2019s their job.When westart taking it seriously \u2013 when we treat that job the way we treat our currentjob \u2013 we discover we\u2019re capable of doing a lot of things that we tended toavoid because we made it easy for the resistance.\n\nWe made it easy for the lizard to not let us do those thingsbecause it\u2019s just a hobby -well, it\u2019s just a bonus \u2013 it\u2019s an extra, it\u2019s athing on top.I have deniability,I don\u2019t have to redesign the packaging, it was the ad agency\u2019s fault, I\u2019ve onlybeen here 12 weeks, spare, part-time, don\u2019t worry about it.But if you\u2019re a pro, then we get to thesixth thing which is your ship.\n\nAnd we can talk about shipping the entire day if you wantto.But the act of shipping it outthe door, of hitting publish, of sending in the proposal, of actually closingthe funding for your company, of having that meeting with your boss, of doingthe difficult conversation \u2013 the act of making a product or service that peoplechoose to talk about \u2013 shipping it out the door is what we have a scarcityof.That\u2019s what we have a shortageof, not compliance, but of people who will do the difficult work ofshipping.\n\nAnd it\u2019s easy if you\u2019ve done 11 editions of that Sundayschool reader.To do the 12thedition, that doesn\u2019t count as shipping.That\u2019s just a revision.That\u2019s just doing your job.What I\u2019m talking about is putting something out the door that peoplemight not like.And there arethree reasons you might not choose to ship.And the order is important.\n\nReason number one is fear, and we\u2019ve talked about that.Reason number two is using the Buddhistterm \u201cprajna\u201d you might not be able to have an understanding of the world as itis.You might not be able to seethe situation in front of you clearly, and so you\u2019ll do the wrong things to getit out the door.\n\nAnd the third reason is maybe you don\u2019t have enough skill todo it well, but the order is important.Because all we focus on is the skill.We don\u2019t focus on the first two.Let\u2019s pick copyrighting for an example.All of us are fairly verbal.We can speak clearly for 20, 30, 40minutes in a row without notes if we\u2019re having a conversation with a friend.\n\nAnd yet, when the boss says, \u201cWrite two paragraphs thatexplain what we do for a living\u201d, panic sets in, right?And we start reading all these blogsand books and \u2026 conversations, \u201cWell, I\u2019m bad at copyrighting, I\u2019m just not agood writer.\u201dYes, but you\u2019re agood talker, what happened in between the talking and the writing?Is it that you don\u2019t know how to hold apencil?That you don\u2019t know how totype?I don\u2019t think so.\n\nThe two reasons you might not actually be able to ship thatparagraph back to your boss is one, you\u2019re afraid that the boss might look youin the eye and say, \u201cHow dare you, this is terrible.\u201dOr two, you might not be able to see the world accuratelyand accurately express what it is you need to say.But if you did see the world accurately, and you weren\u2019tafraid, this is a two-minute assignment.But you learned in second grade not to treat it like that.In second grade you learned that whenyou have to hand in that homework assignment it might come back with red marksall over it and it\u2019s not going to lead to much upside but it could lead to alot of downside.\n\nSo I guess what happens is there are some people if you givethem a mile, they\u2019re going to take an inch.If you give people this opportunity to do that art, to makethat change happen, to have an impact, they\u2019ll figure out how to minimizeit.They\u2019ll figure out how to makeit a smaller opportunity.They\u2019llfigure out how to look for less.\n\nWhy on each would we choose to do that?The answer seems pretty simple.The answer is because it\u2019s safer.The answer is because in the short run,making, as Zig Ziglar would say, the frying pan smaller lowers the bar on thesize of the fish you need to catch.And this is why so many people who call themselves entrepreneurs reallyaren\u2019t.\n\nThis is why it\u2019s so difficult for somebody to start abusiness that really grows.It\u2019swhy every time you look at a 6-year-old or an 8-year-old or a 12-year-old, whatwe\u2019re seeing is someone whose been trained over and over and over again to pushfor smaller assignments, to figure out how to hand stuff in at the very lastminute.To whenever possible, gofor the inch instead of the mile.Because the mile is the scary part.\n\nLet me shift gears here for just a minute.And I want to talk instead of economicsand I want to talk a little bit about joy.And I want to talk about what is it that you do that youlove?I think we can agree thatwhat we like is to go to work, do our job, get a pat on the back and gohome.We\u2019ve been trained to likethat and a lot of people like it.\n\nBut what do we love?What are the things that we do during the day that we actually love todo?That we\u2019re going to remember aweek or a month or a year later?Is there anything wrong with getting money for doing the things that youlove?Does it corrupt it if you\u2019regetting paid to do it?And isthere enough money so that you could be bought off to do not things that youlove?\n\nAnd when we have this thing of art connecting with thisthing of commerce, we get really confused.We get really confused because money isn\u2019t just thispaper.Money stands for anenormous amount in our lives.Andwhen we can sacrifice our art for what we think is a safe opportunity to havemoney, so often that\u2019s exactly what we do.\n\nWhereas if you find somebody like Spike Lee who lived onmacaroni and cheese and credit cards for years instead of doing what he wassupposed to after film school, by lowering his need for money, he raised hisability to do art.And ever sincethen, he\u2019s been able to do what he wanted to do instead of doing what he had todo.So he paid this price in termsof security, in terms of fitting in.And in exchange, he got to do the work that he wanted to.\n\nYou\u2019re going to have to make a choice.Your clients are going to have to makea choice.Your team is going tohave to make a choice.What yourcompany does for a living has to make a choice.And the choice is this: either you break rules or you followrules.Those are the choices.There doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot ofmiddle ground.\n\nYou can say well mostly we follow the rules, but every oncein a while we break them.But ifyou say that, really what you\u2019re saying is we follow the rules unless we haveno choice.There are people inthis room who I have enormous amounts of respect for who have decided to breakrules.And we\u2019ll talk about someof that later in the day.But onceyou decide to break rules, then you can make intelligent choices about whichrules to break.But if you\u2019ve madethe decision that your job is to follow rules, you don\u2019t get to have thechoice.And the only reason Iwrote the book is to get people to make that choice.I just want you to pick.Break rules or follow the rules.Fit in or stand out.Race to the top or race to the bottom.\n\nAnd the problem with racing to the bottom is you mightwin.And if you win the race tothe bottom, that\u2019s where you\u2019re stuck.Whereas if you race to the top, you might now win but it\u2019s okay becauseyou\u2019re getting closer all the time.\n\nWe talked a little bit about this idea of emotionallabor.I\u2019m not sure people reallyget the impact of both words, so let me start with the second one.Labor means hard.I never had a baby, but my guess isit\u2019s called labor for a reason.And labor is worth paying for because very few people do it forfun.Emotional is even harder thanphysical.\n\nThere are people who voluntarily go for a long run to do thephysical labor on their muscles because they actually like the way itfeels.But emotional labor \u2013 laborthat makes you want to cry, labor that makes you feel tiny, labor that makesyou feel like a failure, labor that brings up all sorts of fear \u2013 reallyhorrible fear, that same feeling you have about things that you don\u2019t even wantto talk about \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to imagine doing that for fun.But what has happened to our economy isthat\u2019s all we\u2019re going to get paid for going forward.\n\nAll we\u2019re going to get paid for at American standards.There are plenty of ways to get paid $2an hour, plenty of ways to get paid $4 an hour.Mechanical \u2026 will keep you busy all day long for $4 anhour for the rest of your life.But if you want to make $50 an hour, which is $100,000 a year, why wouldwe pay your for that?\n\nWe don\u2019t need to pay you to type.We don\u2019t need to pay you to move widget A to pile B.We don\u2019t need to pay you to sit in ameeting and come up with objections.All we need to pay you for is doing this really difficult work.\n\nI have a couple of the bonus items that I want to touchon.This idea of honest signals \u2013Sandy Pentland wrote a book about it, he does research at MIT \u2013 is so importantand again, it\u2019s not a theory, it\u2019s real science, the people have tested and itworks.Human beings, like most wildanimals, are extraordinarily good at sensing tiny changes in theenvironment.And the changes thatwe\u2019re the best at sensing are the way other people are feeling.That you can look somebody in the eyeand know if they\u2019re afraid.Youcould look someone in the eye and have a sense as to whether they\u2019relying.There are some people whocan trick you but generally they can\u2019t.\n\nAnd so when you meet someone who is truly generous, you canjust tell.When you meet someonewho is truly on the team and moving stuff forward, you can just tell.When you meet someone who is clearlytrying to slow things down, you can just tell.So you can\u2019t fake the things that go into this emotionallabor thing.You have to havechosen before you got there.You\u2019ve have to have committed before you got there because people aregoing to be able to smell it on you, literally.\n\nThat means that the more interactions we have, particularlynon-digital ones, the more likely it is that people will follow you when theysense that you\u2019re on the path, that you\u2019re actually making something happen.The path though, is the problem because you want a map.You want someone to say what do I donext?You want someone to say,\u201cNow do this and now do this and then you win.\u201d\n\nIf you go to a writer\u2019s conference there\u2019s all these peoplepaying money to be told step by step how to write a book that hasn\u2019t beenwritten yet.If you go to artschool, there are all these days \u2013 days and days and days for money \u2013 step bystep on how to paint something that\u2019s never been painted yet.\n\nThere\u2019s no difference between that and coming up with a newstrategy for a textbook.There\u2019sno difference between that and launching an iPad app that changeseverything.No one can tell youhow.\n\nAfter Twitter hit the curve and became the fastest-growingcommunications medium in history, dozens of companies just like Twitter camealong.It only takes a week toprogram something like Twitter.You don\u2019t win any prizes for having the seventh version of Twitter.We don\u2019t need that.We needed you to do it before whenthere was no map.\n\nMany management consultants know about the knowing-doinggap.This is a different kind ofknowing-doing gap.Theknowing-doing gap is that someone can read a book, it tells them what the mapis and then they don\u2019t do anything.The knowing-doing gap is a manager can say to somebody \u201cI need you to dothese things\u201d and they shake their head and they know it, but they don\u2019t dothem.We now have betterunderstanding about why that is.It\u2019s not because the person\u2019s stupid.It\u2019s because the person has chosen notto do it.They have chosen not todo it for only one reason \u2013 they\u2019re afraid.\n\nWe don\u2019t like saying because we think fear is a differentsort of fear.It\u2019s thenah-nah-nah-you\u2019re-a-chicken fear. And that\u2019s not the kind of fear I\u2019m talkingabout.I\u2019m talking about the feardeep down that the lizard brain has for survival.\n\nI went to a business school that used to be called chaospilots in Amsterdam a couple weeks ago.They stand in a circle before every day and they do something called\u201ccheck in.\u201dAnd the way check-inworks is there are 12 people in a circle and it\u2019s silent.\n\nAnd when you feel like you have something to say about yourday today, your day yesterday, you say it.And when you\u2019re done, you say \u201ccheck out.\u201dSo you say \u201cCheck in.I\u2019m really glad to be here today.Check out.\u201d\n\nAnd everyone goes around the circle not in order, just whenit occurs to you.And we wentthrough that and it was my turn and I was about ninth and I\u2019m not shy, so Isaid, \u201cYou know?I don\u2019t think youshould call this \u2018Check in,\u2019 I think you should call it \u2018Chicken\u2019 because whatyou\u2019re doing is your\u2019 giving everyone cover to say nothing, and what we reallyneed to say is \u2018this is what I\u2019m afraid of today, this is what I was afraid ofyesterday.\u2019\u201d\n\nIf we could honesty say out loud what we\u2019re afraid of, itturns out that what we\u2019re afraid of isn\u2019t that scary.But because we pushed it over there into the closet, itseems really scary.But if we openthe door of the closet, look it in the eye, call it by name, what are we afraidof?\n\nI\u2019m giving a speech to 12 people.I\u2019m petrified.Why are you petrified?Theymight not like it.Then what wouldhappen?I wouldn\u2019t have to do itagain.Okay.So can we move on?Is it worth staying up all nightworrying about this?\n\nYou could be afraid of saber tooth tigers \u2013 that\u2019s a goodthing to be afraid of.It\u2019s evenokay to be afraid of pit bulls.Itis not okay to be afraid of giving a speech to 12 people.What\u2019s going to happen?What\u2019s the worse that couldhappen?And if you say it outloud, what you see is this: it\u2019s very easy to describe what will happen if youstick with the status quo.If youdon\u2019t give a speech, ever.If youdon\u2019t have a blog, ever.If youdon\u2019t put your ideas in front of people, ever.\n\nIf you don\u2019t ship ever, then I guarantee what\u2019s going tohappen \u2013 you\u2019ll stay here until you get laid off and then you\u2019re going to getold and then you\u2019re going to die.\n\nThe other choice is to build an organization where you havea platform for people to do art.And the price of being in that organization is that youdemand change.And this is whereleadership comes in.\n\nTrue story.Iused to have a company.It was 70people; we were in one big room.The New York office had 50 people in one giant room.And the rules were every 30 to 90 days;everyone had to move their desk to sit in a different place.And I told people the reason wasbecause no one should have to sit next to me for too long.\n\nBut the real reason is because if you can get over the fearof moving your desk, then it\u2019s easy to get over the fear of a new businessmodel, the fear of a new role in the company because you have to go through allthat act of moving stuff.\n\nAbout two years into it, I sat down with one of my threebest employees and I said to him, \u201cLook, I\u2019ve been going through what we\u2019vebeen up to, and in the last nine months, you haven\u2019t failed once.You haven\u2019t done one thing that didn\u2019twork.\u201dAnd so I said, \u201cIf youdon\u2019t fail soon, you\u2019re fired.\u201dAnd I meant it.\n\nYou can\u2019t have it both ways.You can\u2019t say this is an organization that embraceschange.This is an organizationthat embraces this kind of risk-taking and then rewards and embraces people whodon\u2019t take risks.Youcan\u2019t.You have to say the way youget fired at this company is by doing what you\u2019re told.The way you lose your job \u2013 the thing Iwant you to be the most afraid of is being the least failing person in theorganization.\n\nIf we can shift the fear to the fear of not doing art, tothe fear of not standing up to the fear of not running to the top, then guesswhat \u2013 the lizard becomes your friend.It becomes your ally to help you ship.If you don\u2019t ship you haven\u2019t done a thing.\n\nThere\u2019s no point in starting if you don\u2019t finish.Finish can include quitting halfwaybecause you\u2019ve done the right analysis.But there is no point in starting doing your best and then washing yourhands of it.That\u2019s just wasting time.Which leads to this thought ofthrashing.And we\u2019re going tospend a bit of time today talking about thrashing as a result as it relates toshipping.\n\nEvery project that ships late ships late for exactly thesame reason.So let me tell youthe story of the sequel to Duke Nukem, one of the most successful video gamesof all times.It made fifty,hundred, million dollars \u2013 something like that.\n\nA tiny group of people owned all the rights.They said we\u2019re going to make thesequel that\u2019s going to be the best video game ever.Six months, ninth months, a year goes by, they\u2019re 80% of theway there.\n\nNow the team has 30 people on it and the meetings about whatcould be done in the last 20% get longer.The contributions of what needs to happen before it ships become morecommon.People say we\u2019re reallyclose to shipping, so let\u2019s add this feature because it would be a shame to nothave it.\n\nWe\u2019re really close to shipping \u2013 wait a minute, there\u2019s thisnew platform out, let\u2019s make sure that we\u2019ll be supporting that one.And it went on and it went on.And it was a perfect storm of an examplebecause they didn\u2019t have a money shortage and there was no person yelling atthem from the other side because it was up to them.\n\nNine years later, they cancelled the project.It got to 80% three times and theycancelled the project.The reasonis simple:because ofthrashing.That the closer we getto shipping the louder the lizard brain gets.The more the reasons there are to worry. Think about howoften the CEO comes to the meeting.\n\nDoes the CEO \u2013 does she come at the beginning or she does comeat the end of the process?Shecomes at the end.Why botherwasting her time, right?Thinkabout when do the lawyers come?Dothe lawyers come at the beginning or do they come at the end?They come at the end and they say,\u201cWait, you can\u2019t do \u2018x\u2019.Well,that was something we needed to know six months ago.\u201dSo the thrashing goes like this and then you don\u2019t shipbecause there are too many people and too many connections and too manyobjections.\n\nSo how do you ship?Well, first you decide it\u2019s important to ship.If you decide it\u2019s important to ship, you do things in theright order, you do them with rigor.And what you say is the first week of this project is when we\u2019re goingto thrash.\n\nLawyers, CEO come during the first week or don\u2019t come atall.We can thrash all we want atthe beginning because we haven\u2019t done, we haven\u2019t laid the foundation, wehaven\u2019t ordered the parts, we haven\u2019t built everything.Come at the beginning and then you\u2019re notallowed back in the room.You willnot see it again until it\u2019s in the store. You will not see it again until it\u2019sonline.You will not see it againuntil it\u2019s shipped out the door, so you better come at the beginning and thrasha lot.\n\nPeople say this is unrealistic.Well, shipping is unrealistic.It is unrealistic to imagine that three or five or fiftymotivated people can make a dent in the universe, but they can.And so the way they do it is by takingthe unrealistic act of thrashing at the beginning.Who runs your project?This is a critical semantic question.Are you going to have someone manage the project or run theproject?What\u2019s the differencebetween managing it and running it?\n\nHere\u2019s my definition.Someone who manages a project is a reporter.The manager of the project reports to you how things aregoing. They report that this person was late.They report that that piece didn\u2019t\u2019 work.They report that certain environmentalsatiations made it so it wouldn\u2019t happen.Someone running the project ships.\n\nA lot of people in your organization don\u2019t want to runanything because if you run something, you can fail.If you manage it, you just report \u2013 sorry, it\u2019s out of mycontrol; I\u2019ve reported everything as it\u2019s happened, nothing I can do aboutit.But if you run it, then you\u2019redoing the work because what you are doing is saying to people, \u201cYou cannot cometo this meeting because I\u2019m responsible for shipping and if you come, we won\u2019tship.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s much easier for the person running to say no toyou, don\u2019t come, than it is to apologize three months later for beinglate.And that mindsetdistinguishes projects that ship from those that don\u2019t.\n\nOkay, so the last thing I want to do is read to you a note Igot.The punchline here isthis:everything I\u2019ve talked toyou about for the last hour isn\u2019t easy.In fact, it\u2019s really hard.If you are a musician or a programmer or an accountant and you want todo art, and your heard everything I just said and you combine it with howdifficult it is to get people in the real world to hear your ideas, howdifficult it is to make a living doing this \u2013 it\u2019s very easy to look \u2013 andeverything \u2026 that\u2019s really hard.\n\nAnd my answer is, \u201cSo? Why shouldn\u2019t it be hard?\u201dWe\u2019re talking about winning one of thebiggest games ever.We\u2019re talkingabout having you impact on whatever universe you live in.We\u2019re talking about turning pages thathave never been turned before.We\u2019re talking about leaving a legacy behind that you can point to 10 or20 or 30 or 40 years later that your kids can point and say, \u201cMy mom shippedthat.\u201d\n\nWhy shouldn\u2019t that be hard?So here\u2019s the note I got:It\u2019s a pretty sobering picture for the future of art.Over the last couple of months, as I\u2019veneared completion and have had to think more about where I\u2019m going to take thismanuscript, and how I\u2019m going to start establishing myself, the more and moreI\u2019m realizing what a daunting, long-term proposition this is going to be.\n\nIf I want to be a person whose main thing is writing, thatis, the difficult part for me is that I\u2019m not sure how to begin building a fanbase, begin cultivating that reputation and necessary connections with people,which makes me realize that if I personally don\u2019t know where to begin orcontinue, I need to find people who can help me.But again, a difficult thing to begin.\n\nWe live in a strange world when the process of trying to getyour message or product to people is more time consuming and exhausting thanthe actual creation of art itself \u2013 the pouring your passion onto canvas orpage.I\u2019m interested to know inwhat ways the model for the music industry is similar to that of publishingbooks.\n\nStill, all this isn\u2019t to turn me from going ahead.It\u2019s just making it clear how much hardwork and creativity I\u2019m going to have to put into finding out where my nextbuck is going to come from.ButI\u2019m glad I\u2019m realizing and beginning to work on this now since I think thatthis is the economic future for America \u2013 less security, money on the margins,needing a close network for support, having hands in many different schemes \u2013that\u2019s not just for artists, that\u2019s the future as a whole.Not sure to what extent my generationunderstands that though.\n\nSo my mission going forward and the reason I said I have noplans to write another book is that this is the turning point of our time.That the hard work of building the FordMotor Company is really hard work.That the hard work of building Prudential Insurance is really hardwork.Those were important thingsthat our parents and our grandparents did.\n\nThe hard work that we have to do is to not use Twitter andFacebook to entertain ourselves and hide from the art.And the hard work that we have to do isnot go to yet another meeting with yet another boring boss who\u2019s going to haveyet another boring project for us to do.\n\nBut the hard work \u2013 and we\u2019re seeing it over and over againin every field I can imagine, not including bringing vaccines to the developingworld \u2013 the hard work is to look at the status quo and say, \u201cWell, they builtall these tools for me.They builtall this leverage for me, and it\u2019s not here to entertain me, it\u2019s here topermit me to put myself at risk, to maybe have someone look me in the eye andsay, \u2018You\u2019re not good enough to do that.\u2019\u201dThat\u2019s really hard.\n\nAnd then what we have to do as trainers or as managers or aspeople who can spread ideas is somehow put in front of people that what we needthem to do is to solve interesting problems.And what we need them to do is lead.And then if all they\u2019reprepared to do is make widgets, we have a long slog ahead of us.But if we\u2019re wiling to race to the topand do work that matters, my bet is that a few of us will do it often enough toactually make change.Thank youfor listening to that part, I appreciate it.Thank you."}]}

That special part of the club (racket) that magically makes the ball go farther and straighter.\nThere\u2019s a sweet spot in promotion and PR as well. Let me give you a few examples from the book world to get us started:\nPeter Druckerwas in the sweet spot for theHarvard Business Review. His background, reputation and style of writing contributed to him writing more pieces for them than anyone else. (My stuff, on the other hand, is blacklisted by the HBR. They won\u2019t even consider my work.)\nIf you want to get reviewed by theNew York Times Book Review, don\u2019t even consider self-publishing. Don\u2019t write a how to book. Don\u2019t write something particularly funny, either. But it sure helps to be published by Knopf. Literary fiction by respected writers published by Knopf is the sweet spot (history comes in a close second).\nThere\u2019s a sweet spot for getting on Oprah and for being on NPR as well.You rarely hear about romance novels on All Things Considered.\nMy point isn\u2019t that you shouldn\u2019t try to get these middlemen to broaden their horizons or to give up on something you\u2019re passionate about. It\u2019s just that it might be easier to build a new sweet spot than it is to persuade an established middleman to change his rules for you.\nI never had a chance with existing magazines so I invented a writing style for myself that worked well withFast Company, which until then had never had a columnist. Bloggers around the world are discovering that it\u2019s cheaper and faster and more effective to build their own media channel than it is to waste time arguing with the old ones.\nSo I guess my advice would be to either build your product and network along the way to align with exactly what the middlemen want\u2026 or reject them and live/thrive without them.

We\u2019re connecting the feeling of worry (it\u2019s not really the biggest meeting of the year, it just feels that way, and the inspector has never failed us before, it just feels that way) with the real world.

I know that on a calm day, the surface is like glass.\nOne reason to lower the water level of a system you count on is to see what's messing things up.

When Toyota got rid of all the extra car parts held in reserve on the assembly line, every single one of them had to be perfect. If a nut or bolt didn't fit, the entire line stopped. No cars got made until the part was perfect.\nThis seems insane. Why would you go through the pain of removing the (relatively) low cost buffer of some extra parts? The answer, it turns out, is that without a buffer, you've lowered the water level and you can see the rocks below. Without a buffer, every supplier had to dramatically up his game. Suddenly, the quality of parts went way up, which, of course, makes the assembly line go faster and every car ends up working better as well.\nFedex had to build a system far more efficient than the one they use at the Post Office. When you only have 12 hours to deliver a package, the rocks will kill you. Now, when they need to deliver something in three days, they're still way better at it than the post office is. Fewer rocks.\nThe purpose of sprinting without slack isn't that you will\u00a0always\u00a0be sprinting, always without extra resources or a net.

In the other, there's a complete standstill.\nOr consider how the TSA functions in an environment of stress (like the Orlando airport). A combination of leisure travelers, poor management and bad architecture means that (at least every time I've been there), there's a lot of yelling, invaded space and wasted time. Not to mention frayed nerves among Disney-overdosed parents in need of anything but more hassle.\nHere are some thoughts for someone who might want to write a book about the panic tax (or someone who runs a system that shouldn't be degraded):\n1. The cost of ameliorating panic in your system is always less than the cost of the lost productivity when panic hits. In other words, all the other steps are worth it.\n2. Slack is the enemy of panic. When in doubt, add resources, or even simpler, remove requirements. That's what the gated entry points on crowded freeways do\u2026 the entire road goes faster when fewer cars are on it, meaning that gating cars at the entrance is actually far faster than letting them on over the course of the commute.\n3. Media voices, politicians and others that create panic for a living need to own responsibility for the way their actions dramatically magnify the cost we all pay.\n4. The answer to, \"should we panic,\" is always no. Always. Panic is expensive, panic compounds and panic doesn't solve the problem.\n5. Install panic dampers at every opportunity. TSA officers should be trained to talk more softly and slowly when their systems approach capacity. Sound deadening devices should be tuned to be most effective when volume increases. The police should be trained to seek compliance second, after they are able to diffuse panic.\n6. They call them panic attacks for a reason. After-action review, an attack-analysis session, ought to be held whenever a system freezes under panic. Find the instigator, the first step, not the last one, and invest in what it takes to ameliorate it next time.\nMostly: Panic averted is far cheaper than panic survived."}]}

The Zune was panned by theTimesand many other reviewers just last week, and yet here\u2019s a piece that\u2019s practically written by their PR firm. What\u2019s up with that?\nThe answer is surprisingly transparent. The Times considers this news, news worthy of two photos and a front of the biz section placement because, \"\u2026after committing hundreds of millions of dollars, Microsoft is scheduled to release that device, Zune.\"\nIn other words, if you spend 9 figures on a tech device or a movie, you can count on publicity like this.\nIf you can\u2019t, time for plan B. Plan B is to hope for this but not count on it. Plan B is to have a plan that works just fine without counting on a busy editor at the local paper to make it work."}]}

Why would you risk your market share and what little customer satisfaction remains by selling off screen space to advertisers?\nSure, some folks with more time than judgment will click on these ads, and sure, your advertisers will smile, but do you really want to alienate millions of users by giving us something we don\u2019t need and don\u2019t want?\nHere are the two questions I hope you\u2019ll ask yourself:a. what does the money we make from this effort do to the long-term profitability of our relationship with customers andb. is this something consumers want? How many calls a day does Verizon get asking for more spam/advertising on their cell phones?\nThe relentless march of capitalism probably means that this is yet another medium about to go down the tubes in the name of short term profit.

If you want to prove some deep insight or give people textured data to draw their own conclusions, DON\u2019T put it in a presentation. Put it in a handout. Give them a URL with a spreadsheet at the other end.\nNo, the reason you put a chart in a presentation is to tell a story. A single story, one story per chart. \"Oh,\" the attendee says, \"our costs are going through the roof!\" Or, in the case of the picture here, \"Oh boy LA and Florida are in big big trouble.\"\nThere is no room for nuance here. You don\u2019t have nuance in the other parts of your presentation, and it doesn\u2019t belong here.\nIf the facts demand nuance, don\u2019t use a graph, because you won\u2019t get nuance, you\u2019ll get confusion.\nNO BAR CHARTSBar charts are dramatically overrated, primarily because they\u2019re the first choice in many graphing programs.\nThe problem with bar charts is that they should either be line/area charts (when graphing a change over time, like unemployment rates) or they should be a simple pie chart (when comparing two or three items at the same scale).\n[I know full well that pie charts are not rigorous and often misused. My point is that if you need to show slight differences or many bits of data, you probably don\u2019t want a chart at all.]\nThe correct use of a bar chart is to show how several items change over a period of time. This, of course, demands nuance.\nMOTIONHere\u2019s the surprising one: You should animate your charts.\nIt\u2019s simple: create two slides. The first one shows where the data used to be, the second one, on the same axes, shows where it is or where it\u2019s going. Motion.\nEstablish the first slide. Make your point about your source and its validity. Then press the advance button. Boom.\nThere are 314 principles for good graphs and charts. But these three laws will take you far."}]}

If I want the real truth about a business and where it\u2019s going, I\u2019d rather see something else. I\u2019d divide the modern business plan into five sections:\nThetruthsection describes the world as it is. Footnote if you want to, but tell me about the market you are entering, the needs that already exist, the competitors in your space, technology standards, the way others have succeeded and failed in the past. The more specific the better. The more ground knowledge the better. The more visceral the stories, the better. The point of this section is to be sure that you\u2019re clear about the way you see the world, and that you and I agree on your assumptions. This section isn\u2019t partisan, it takes no positions, it just states how things are.\nTruth can take as long as you need to tell it. It can include spreadsheets, market share analysis and anything I need to know about how the world works.\nTheassertionssection is your chance to describe how you\u2019re going to change things. We will do X, and then Y will happen. We will build Z with this much money in this much time. We will present Q to the market and the market will respond by taking this action.\nThis is the heart of the modern business plan. The only reason to launch a project is to change something, and I want to know what you\u2019re going to do and what impact it\u2019s going to have.\nOf course, this section will be incorrect. You will make assertions that won\u2019t pan out. You\u2019ll miss budgets and deadlines and sales. So thealternativessection tells me what you\u2019ll do if that happens. How much flexibility does your product or team have? If your assertions don\u2019t pan out, is it over?\nThe people section rightly highlights the key element\u2026 who is on your team, who is going to join your team. \u2018Who\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean their resume, who means their attitudes and abilities and track record in shipping.\nAnd the last section is all about money. How much do you need, how will you spend it, what does cash flow look like, P&Ls, balance sheets, margins and exit strategies.\nYour local VC might not like this format, but I\u2019m betting it will help your team think through the hard issues more clearly."}]}

After that, there was a gold rush that led to the creation of dozens of billion dollar brands.\n80 years later, the prohibition against pot is ending in various places throughout North America and then, probably, worldwide.\nThe question some professional marketers are asking is: Will there be worldwide profitable brands for pot that are similar to Bacardi, Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff for alcohol?\nBoth industries are regulated. Both have products that are sold in specialty stores. Both use non-proprietary manufacturing techniques.\nHere\u2019s the big difference:\nWhen alcohol marketing became legal, it coincided with the glory days of magazines, radio and then TV.The mass marketing phenomenon happened at exactly the same time as these brands were being rolled out\u2014and along with cigarettes, alcohol brands were major advertisers, particularly in magazines (hard liquor) and TV (beer). The ads supported the media in a fundamental way (and vice versa\u2013Rick\u2019s Cafe anyone?).\nBut when cannabis marketing arrives, it\u2019s the internet that\u2019s dominant. Andthe internet isn\u2019t a mass medium.\nIt seems like one. It\u2019s used by billions of people.\nBut it\u2019s a micro medium. A direct marketing medium. There are 3 billion people online, but they\u2019re busy looking at 3,000,000 web pages (that\u2019s only a thousand a page).\nThe other difference is that there\u2019s a thousand-year tradition of the pub and the bar. And those facilities offer status games, word of mouth and significant margins that created another marketing engine for alcohol that won\u2019t exist for cannabis.\nSure, it\u2019s possible that the huge demand and profit margins will fund a winner-take-all advertising movement for pot.

And when there were human-like creatures, they spent much of their time doing not much. Nomads eat when they need to, move around and hang out. It\u2019s not an easy life, but there are none of the modern distractions or problems that urban culture presents.\nGrain began to change things, because agriculture produces far more calories per acre, allowing populations to grow\u2026 and to store the results of our labor. Stored grain, though, is easier to steal and to tax than something that must be eaten fresh off the tree or harvested.\nAnd so you get markets and wars and governments and the rise of a group of people wealthier than any individual farmer or nomad could be.\nThis is all mostly irrelevant. It\u2019s irrelevant in the way that understanding how Edison made movies or sound recordings is irrelevant. It\u2019s nice to know the history, but it doesn\u2019t help you win an Oscar or a Grammy.\nThe two most relevant forces are in a powerful dance right now:\n\u2022 The carbon-fueled growth of industry.\n\u2022\u00a0The information-fueled growth of ideas and connection.\nIndustrychanged the way the Earth looks from space, it enriched billions of people and it has driven our species to the brink of extinction due to our impact on the climate.

I cannot calculate the curve and complete the figure by the experience of sight; I can divine it by conscience. But from what I see I am sure it bends towards justice.\nWe really don\u2019t have a lot of choice about yesterday. Here we are, many of us with more leverage and power than any human on Earth had just a hundred years ago.\nIn the last few decades, so many areas of culture have moved forward that defenders of the status quo are becoming exhausted trying to defend what was. And they sometimes express that exhaustion through anger, division and vitriol.\nThe good news is that we have exactly what we need to make things better. If enough of us stand up and lead and connect, we\u2019ll continue to get closer to what\u2019s possible.\nHere\u2019s to peace of mind and possibility. They go together."}]}

Someone readingField & Stream, for example, is a more valuable prospect to a bullet company than someone readingBass Fisherman.\nMissing from this demographically-based analysis is the idea that people can change. They change their posture, their attention and their attitude. And as the knowledge they receive increases, their value as a prospect changes as well.\nI think marketers always knew this, but they haven\u2019t been able to do much about it.\nUntil now.\nThe Google funnel is easily measured and if you\u2019re marketing anything to anyone, you need to understand it (this idea is so powerful it\u2019s now built in to Google\u2019s free web analytics program, Urchin).\nImagine someone out there, surfing on the web. He is a prospect of your fishing bait company in that one day, he might become a customer. He\u2019s at the top of the funnel.\nNow, he types \"bass\" into Google. Through that action, he has self-identified as a better prospect. He\u2019s moved down the funnel and become more valuable to you.\nBut, of course, he might have meant \"bass\" as in \"bass guitar.\" Once he refines his search in that way, he\u2019s jumped out the funnel. For right now, he\u2019s not worth much.\nBut wait! He has refined his search by typing in \"bass fishing.\" Now, he\u2019s worth a great deal more than he was just a moment ago. Which is why AdWords is such a good idea.\nYou have a choice when you run an AdWord ad. You can write copy that gets lots of clicks, or more specific copy that gets fewer, but better clicks. Traditional marketers believed that attention was free, and the more the merrier. But Google charges by the click, so new marketers realize that they are willing to pay extra for folks a bit farther down the funnel.\nNow, if he\u2019s clicked on \"Bass Lures for serious fishermen,\" our surfer\u2019s value has just increased immensely. And you\u2019ve paid handsomely for borrowing his attention from Google. Now the prospect is on your site, and his value to you is quite high\u2013and his cost is high as well.\nAt this point, your job isnotto make a sale. Selling is just one option in a range of things you can do to further drive him down the funnel. You can engage in a dialogue (by phone or email) that takes place over time and avoids the all-or-nothing cliff of \"buy now or go away forever\". You can further inform or entertain, all in the service of your goal of increasing the interest, education and value of this prospect.\nNow, finally, you have refined the traffic in the funnel. Everyone at the bottom is ready to buy, to engage with you, to become a customer.\nOnce you see the funnel, it\u2019s easy to understand how valuable your existing customers are, and easy to think about how you want to spend time and money in promoting and building your site. Most marketers are running a flat campaign. Embracing the funnel changes the way you treat people. And treating different people differently is what consumers demand."}]}

It's easier to talk about the little stuff, or events withhope.\nWe also do it with science, to facts about the world around us.\nThere\u2019s a long history of denialism, defending the status quo and ignoring what others discover. That two balls of different weights fall at the same speed. That the Earth rotates around the Sun. That the world is millions of years old. That we walked on the Moon.\nThe denials all sound the same. They don\u2019t come from stupidity, from people who aren\u2019t smart enough to understand what\u2019s going on.They come from people who won\u2019t look.\nWhy deny? It's a way to avert our eyes.\nTwo related reasons, internal and external.\nThe external reason is affiliation. What happens to one's standing when you dare to question the accepted status quo? What are the risks to doing your own research, to putting forth afalsifiabletheory and being prepared to find it proven wrong? What will you tell your neighbors?\nWhen adherence to the status quo of our faith or organization or social standing looms large, it\u2019s often far easier to just look the other way, to feign ignorance or call yourself a skeptic (n.b. all good scientists are actually skeptics, that\u2019s how they build careers\u2026 the difference is that the skeptical scientist does the work to prove to her peers that she\u2019s right, and acknowledges when she\u2019s not).\nThere\u2019s more data available to more people than ever before. And the prize for using statistics and insight to contradict the scientific status quo is huge. If a thesis doesn\u2019t sit right with you,look closer, not away. Do the science, including acknowledging when your theory isn\u2019t right.\nThe internal reason is fear. The fear of having to re-sort what we believe. Of feeling far too small in a universe that\u2019s just too big. Most of all, of engaging in a never-ending cycle of theories and testing, with the world a little shaky under our feet as we live with a cycle that gets us closer to what\u2019s real.\nPart of being our best selves is having the guts to not avert our eyes, to look closely at what scares us, what disappoints us, what threatens us. By looking closely we have a chance to make change happen."}]}

Given the extraordinary feedback I've gotten from readers, it encouraged me to figure out ways to spread the idea to more people.\nTo that end, the paperback comes out today. It's four dollars cheaper, which in the scheme of things isn't a lot, but paperbacks have proven to make a huge difference in widespread adoption (Eat, Pray, Lovesold more than 1000% as many copies after they made the shift).

I gave him free rein to do what he liked, and he took it\u2026 700 hours of creation, 1,000 pieces of art\u2026 the rendering alone took 27 hours. This project took on a life of its own, and it took blood, sweat, tears and money to finish it. What to do next?\nMy original thought was to create a DVD of the presentation and offer itfor sale for $300. Shipping worldwide included. Each copy comes with live performance rights, so you can present it to groups (but not online).\nThat's fine for corporations, coaches and organizations, but I wanted to share it with more people. One way is to create a complex system that would require you to submit a receipt for buying the paperback and getting some sort of passkey, etc.\nI decided that this was too complex and not trusting enough.\nHence the honor system. The Road Trip video has been broken into four pieces for manageability and we inserted a tiny blurb for the paperback in each one. You can watch the entire video right now, at no extra cost, online. All you have to do is truthfully type in a password (The password is: iboughtthebook) when you watch each part of the video.Here's the link to the first part.\nHave fun.

And entrepreneurs need to know a lot, but not what they teach in a typical MBA program.\nThe stratified work of big name investment banks, consultants, law firms and fancy doctoring is increasingly veering away from the actual contributions of people who have an impact that they can measure and be proud of.\nIf that sort of work is for you, go for it. But do it with intent.\nIf not, then perhaps it makes sense to start on the work right this minute. Not with a full certification or permit, but simply creating the sort of change you seek to make, in small steps, right now."}]}

For fifty years, TV meant that programmers and advertisers had a very good chance to reach everyone, or almost everyone, at the same time. TV integrates a culture, because there's instant common touchstones being generated daily. (When I say, \"yadda yadda yadda\" or \"where's the beef,\" you know what I mean, right?)\nTV bringspluralismand diversity. This seems to contradict the first, but it doesn't. Once TV has opened a channel to the brain, it can bring in whatever it chooses, without clearing it with you first. So, the viewer can discover that people-who-don't-look-like-us aren't so different, or that women might be good cops, or that a member of the [insert oppressed group] might also be a person too.\nand finally, TV bringsdissatisfaction. Advertising needs to make you dissatisfied to work. And picture perfect sitcom families have more money and less trouble than most folks (because they're not real).\nNow, of course, TV isn't what it used to be. No more three-channel universe. That means that the cable/internet virus changes everyone in a very different way. Call it the million channel world (mcw).\nThe mcw brings addressability. There is no mass any more. You can't reach everyone. Mad Men is a hit and yet it has only been seen by 2% of the people in the USA.\nThe mcw bring silos, angry tribes and insularity. Fox News makes a fortune by pitting people against one another.Talkingpointsmemois custom tailored for people who are sure that the other side is wrong. You can spend your entire day consuming media and never encounter a thought you don't agree with, don't like or don't want to see.\nAnd finally, I have no idea if the mcw is making us happy. Surely, a substantial use is time wasting social network polishing, and that's not really building anyone's long-term happiness. And the mcw makes it easier to get angry, to waste time (there's never 'nothing on') or become isolated. Without a doubt, the short-term impact of mcw is that it makes it easy to spread terror and harder to settle on the truth. At the same time, there's no doubt that more people are connected to more people, belong to more tribes, have more friends, and engage more often than they did before it got here. We got rid of some gatekeepers, but there's a race for some new ones. In the meantime, a lot of smart people are fending for themselves, which isn't so bad.\nOne thing we learned from the TV age that's still true: more media is not always better, particularly when we abdicate our power to filter and choose."}]}

The stated strategy of the company was to build more and more internal content and services (Yahoo mail, Yahooligans, Yahoo Finance) to keep as many surfers on their site for as long as they could. The math was simple: if you\u2019re getting paid by the impression, having someone stay for twenty or thirty clicks is way more profitable than encouraging them to leave and go to another site.\nGoogle blew this status quo wide open. Their model was very different: \u201ccome here on your way to somewhere else.\u201d\u00a0 There were only two links on their home page, because the only place they wanted to encourage you to go was wherever a good search led you.\nIf you were a company or an individual with something to say, this hub and spoke model was essential to your ability to make a difference online. The web is a very big haystack, but if your needle was sharp enough, the promise was that you could get found.\nAnd if you were someone looking for information, commerce or connection, you could rely on Google to take you there.\nThis, as much as anything, enabled Google to draw huge amounts of traffic away from Yahoo. It didn\u2019t take very long for surfers to realize that they wanted to see what else was out there, not be shunted around a walled garden.\nYear after year, driven by the short-term (shortsighted) demands of the public markets, Google has been losing its way on this effective (and community-based) strategy. In the most recent data Rand quoted, we see that more than half the time, a search on Google leads to someone either clicking on nothing (because they found what they needed without leaving the search results) or visiting a property Google already owns.\nOn a regular basis, Google makes changes to their UI and algorithm that destroy companies or industries in order to keep more time and clicks from the person who was expecting to find themselves somewhere else after visiting Google.\nIf you\u2019re a fan of the open web, this is bad news.\nIf you\u2019re an individual or business that\u2019s hoping to be \u2018found\u2019 via a search, this is bad news.\nAnd if you\u2019re a Google employee or shareholder this is bad news as well, because monopoly is a tempting place to extract cash and drive the stock up, but it\u2019s not stable.\nThe resilience of the connected open web is one of the shining lights of our modern culture, and my hope is that we can avert lock-in before we calcify around the current status quo.\nEvery monopoly seems like it\u2019s going to last forever, until it doesn\u2019t."}]}

You can give every low-mileage car a new set of spark plugs that will increase fuel efficiency by 5 mpg, up to 15.

For ease, let\u2019s call them \u2018customers.\u2019\nOnce you see that, it becomes pretty clear that this is the most difficult and important thing that the organization does, and in fact is the only one you can\u2019t outsource or work your way around.\nIt\u2019s possible but unlikely that the first product or service you develop will be exactly what potential customers were already hoping for. That\u2019s why failure is the fuel that moves new projects forward.Failure is a way of discovering one more thing that customers didn\u2019t want, and perhaps, learning a bit about what they might want. By iterating without tears or fears, organizations are able to discover things about their future customers.\nSometimes (actually, almost every time) the innovation an organization brings to the market isn\u2019t instantly and universally adopted. While there are people who get satisfaction and status and results by going first (early adopters), most customers would prefer to wait. These customers see little upside in investing the time to be a pioneer or in taking the risk to go first.\n[And to be clear, that\u2019s true for non-profit donors, voters and any other sort of \u2018customer\u2019].\nAnd so you see the paradox: on one hand, organizations need to be agile and eager to pivot as they engage with a market that\u2019s invisible or skeptical, but on the other hand, ideas don\u2019t spread through a marketplace instantly.\nThat\u2019s one reason why it\u2019s so important to identify your smallest viable audience. The smallest group of customers that will enable you to thrive. By seeing them, obsessing about them and serving them, you can refine your product at the very same time that you establish the conditions for growth.\nAt this stage, growth can come from one of two places:\nIt could be that your core audience begins to tell the others. That you\u2019ve built the network effect into your offering, so that it works even better when people tell their friends and colleagues. This is Tom\u2019s shoes or Starbucks coffee. This is Twitter and the ice bucket challenge as well. When you create a purple cow, the remarkable nature of your product or service is in fact part of the reason people buy it, and the reason they talk about it. Not because it helps you, but because it helps them.\nOr, just as powerful, it could be that your success at serving this small but viable audience gives you the team, the cash flow and most of all, the social proof to begin to find a different set of customers. Customers that might want a different set of benefits, a different story, a different way to change.\nOften, this shift to a different customer set is difficult, because now you might feel stretched, you might even have to leave behind the people who originally embraced you and your offering. Patagonia doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time selling removable pitons to hard-core rock climbers anymore. As they shifted to become the organization they are now, they probably got a lot of push back from people who said, \u201cno one buys from them anymore, it\u2019s too popular.\u201d\nBoth approaches share two underlying principles:\nYou\u2019re telling a story.\nYou\u2019re making a change.\nBeing clear about \u2018who\u2019s it for?\u2019 and \u2018what\u2019s it for?\u2019 is the actual hard work of developing customers. And if you\u2019re not gaining traction, deciding to hype harder is not the right choice. Traction doesn\u2019t come from more social posting or working your network and asking for favors. Traction comes from accompanying the customers you\u2019ve chosen on a journey that they\u2019re eager to go on.\nAnd the hard work of customer development is finding a reason for your customers to bring in new customers, or discovering a path where you can help non-customers discover what you offer and eagerly engage with it.\nFurther Reading:Blank & Dorf,Purple Cow,Crossing the Chasm,Story Driven,This is Marketing"}]}

Instead of a committee deciding everything that ought to be on the page and compromising at every step, an effective website is created by someone who knows what she wants the user to do.\nJosh Davis and others wanted to know if, after more than a decade, my opinion has changed.

Why? Even though they weren\u2019t going to hear the jazz great and his group that night (even though they\u2019d paid, hired the sitter, etc.) they were applauding howrealhe was. If the artist didn\u2019t want to play, that was fine with them.\nReading an auction catalog tonight, I just discovered that Gene Roddenberry designed the phaser to be a profitable children\u2019s toy first, a Star Trek prop second. And the only reason theKlingons had a ship is that the Enterprise model kit sold so well\u2026 They even let the model company, AMT, build the prop so that they could be sure the model sold in stores would be the same. Does that make you think anything less of Roddenberry\u2019s universe?\nJackson Pollock painted what he wanted and died young. Andy Warhol painted what would sell\u2026 and died rich.\nIf I write a book or a blog post or design a web page that\u2019s designed to spread first and inform second, do you care about my intent? It\u2019s pretty obvious that most of the online video stuff that\u2019s running wild online was designed to do just that\u2013run wild. And MySpace is a traffic triumph. Not because the pages are what you or I might design, but because they were intentionally built for that sneezing teen and post-teen cohort.\nWhen David Chase built the Sopranos, he wanted to tell a great story first, and get rich second. It was authentic in its first goal, and he accomplished his second. But when you eat at the fifth or sixth restaurant opened by a celebrity mega-chef, it\u2019s pretty clear that the goals are reversed. Does that make the meal worse?\nIs it okay to set out to serve a predictable, reliable, impersonal meal in a restaurant that costs $100 a seat?\nI thought of these countless rhetorical questions when the waiter came over and said, \"Sangrias for the table? They\u2019re really good tonight!\"\nAre they? Are they better than on other nights? Or is this part of the script, designed to easily improve profit per seat by 30%\u2026 By selling us on the smell of authenticity, the fact that the sangrias might in fact be special, it makes it more fun to eat there (for some). I noticed on the way out that the specials were painted on the mirror over the bar\u2026 I had a fantastic time in the restaurant, because the company and the conversation were terrific. But I couldn\u2019t help feeling like I was a little cheated because nothing felt real.\nIt\u2019s that bell curve thing again. Those of us on the left, call us the authentic fringe, value intent, sometimes even more than we care about the results. The middle, the masses, they want both, that blissful combination of authenticity (even if it\u2019s well faked, orespeciallyif it\u2019s well faked) and popularity. Call them the \"smells authentic\" masses. And there on the right is the factory fringe, the people who don\u2019t want even a whiff of authenticity\u2026 it reminds them of risk and inconsistency. [click on the picture to make it readable].\nLike Rogers\u2019 product adoption lifecycle, products can move along this curve. Starbucks used to be just one place, way out on the fringe\u2026 Howard, the founder, got yelled at by his father-in-law for being a nutcase about coffee. And then, it moved to the right. Same thing for Emeril and Bobby Flay.\nOf course, I\u2019m letting my Authentic Fringe biases show here.The reason that the popular restaurants are so popular is because people like them!"}]}

Get out front, even a little, and you sell more because many people like to invest in a winner. We like to read what other people are reading.\nA classic example of cumulative advantage is the power of theTimes\u2019list.\nRebecca has a goodpostabout the list but she misses the two key points.\nThe first: TheTimes\u2019list is completely fictional. Made up. Divorced from reality. The stated goal of the list is to find (and promote) books thatTimeseditors want people to read, not books that are actually selling a lot. (The editor of the Book Review told this to me years ago). So, they make up \u2018rules\u2019 to appear consistent. WhenHarry Potterwas selling like crazy, they invented a new list so that they could take JK Rowling\u2019s books off the real list. When diet and other books started selling a lot, they made up a new ghetto (miscellaneous) for those books. When books started selling in places like Wal-Mart (thus driving the snootiness factor down) theTimespenalized sales in chain outlets. And books like the Bible are banished because they\u2019re not current enough.\nThe second: the list is easier to manipulate than ever before. The identity of reporting stores is becoming easier to find and the leverage of being on the list is high enough that authors can profit just by buying their own books in enough quantity.\nThe best part\u2026 it doesn\u2019t matter. Cumulative advantage is so powerful that even though the accurate reports of book sales often completely contradict theTimeslist, authors and others still obsess over it. We\u2019re always looking for clues, especially in crowded markets.\nThe thing that amazes me is that there are so few bestseller lists in other markets. Consumers want them. Producers can leverage them. It\u2019s an opportunity, I think."}]}

Are there incentives in place for consent to be skipped, or  profits to be made when people are not fully informed?

They've long bought ads to polish their image, but mostly work to alter the culture in ways that will ensure they'll get just a little bit more yield out of each of us. 64 ounce Coke, anyone?\nAs long as industrialists are measuring productivity, engaging in scientific management and focused on ROI and predictability, there will always be a gap between the dreams of those they interact with and the demands of their shareholders.\nThere are lots of ways to justify the work of industrialists, to point to the efficiencies and productivity they create. That doesn't mean that we must aspire to nothing more."}]}

Beautiful, bespoke, handmade hats.\nBut we're a hundred years past the time someone can say, \"I make hats,\" and be done with it.\nSome of the questions the marketer needs to ask, questions that amplify the, \"who's it for?\" mindset:\nAre these hats for people who are already shopping for hats?\nAre they a gift item for someone who is looking \u00a0to please someone who is looking for something new? Proven? Cheaper than it looks? Rare?\nAre they a shopping experience, a bespoke process that is exciting and filled with possibility, just for the person who values both the process and the hat?\nOr, are these hats for women who appreciate beauty in any form, and who have already bought all the scarves they can handle? Or perhaps for people who want to buy what the people they admire are buying?\nThe marketer can change her story, but she can't easily change the worldview of the person she seeks to sell to.It's almost impossible to turn someone who doesn't care about hats (in particular) into someone who cares a lot about hats.\nThis person the product is for: What do they believe? Who do they trust? What do they seek? What are they afraid of?\nSatya is well on her way to decoding this puzzle.\nSecond example: Paul makes and sellsamplifiers. To an outsider, these amps are ridiculously overbuilt, oversized and overpriced. To some hobbyists, though, they are magical, brilliantly engineered and priced at 90% less than what similar products cost. (!)\nThe questions, then, are about the story the potential customer tells himself:\nDo I seek something corporate, mass produced, powerful, handmade, unique, rare, new, proven, high-value, high-priced, top-of-the-line, mysterious, invisible\u2026 Do I want to be able to tell myself a story about these every time I turn them on?

It's about role models\u00a0and feelings and emotions first, with the words added later, and the machinery (or the felt) added last.\nIn Paul's case, he and his team have been direct and consistent in celebrating the nature of the design and the designer. They haven't said to the world, \"here it is, it's for everyone,\" instead, they've said, \"this is our story, this is who built it\u00a0and who it's for, it might be for you if you're the person that resonates with this sort of story.\"\nMost inventors and marketers start with what they have (the stuff) and try to work backward to the 'who is it for' question. It makes a lot more sense to go the other direction. Identify a set of fears, dreams and attitudes and then figure out what sort of story fits that lock in a way that\u00a0delights the consumer. Then go build that.\nNot just hats and amps. This thinking is also where Lululemon, Nike and AeroPress\u00a0came from. Maybe your next project, too."}]}

Throughout history, many people have chosen the salt. Gold is pretty, but you can\u2019t live without salt, and when it was more scarce than gold, it became valuable enough to use as a currency itself. (The word \"salary\" is even related to the Latin for \"salt.\")\nToday, of course, salt is close to worthless. Given the choice between a pile of salt and a pile of gold, you\u2019d go for the gold every time, because there\u2019s less of it around.\nScarcity, it seems, has a lot to do with value.\n\u2026we\u2019re running out of a lot of important things\u2013clean water, free time, breathable air, the ozone layer, and honest leadership, just to name a few. At the same time, we have to worry about something that is about to affect just about every business I can think of. We\u2019re running out of scarcity.\nScarcity, after all, is the cornerstone of our economy.The best way to make a profit is by trading in something that\u2019s scarce.This is why the music and movie industries are so terrified by the millions of people who download entertainment from the Internet every day. Downloading threatens to make supply virtually unlimited, and that could make their offerings about as valuable as those of some kids down my street who recently tried to run a stand selling freshly made mud.\nIt seems as though once a category becomes successful, the headlong rush to knock it off is stronger (and quicker) than it ever was before. Last week, a woman who came to a seminar in my office was desperately searching for a way to improve her mortgage-brokerage business. I ruined her day when I suggested that she shut her company down and try something else. Twenty years ago, most mortgages were written by the local bank. Those banks planted the seeds of their obsolescence when they eliminated judgment from the writing of mortgages. Once they could automate a mortgage application, so could everyone else. So mortgage brokers used their low overhead and quick wits as an advantage and stole the business. Today, there are an infinite number of brokers to choose from, all offering essentially the same service. The result is that there is no scarcity, and no profit.\nIt\u2019s not just about product knockoffs, of course. While there are almost half a million lawyers practicing in the United States today, there are (gasp!) more than 125,000 in school right now. No matter what you believe about lawyers creating ever more work for ever morelawyers,there\u2019s no question that with so many of them, they\u2019re hardly scarce.\nThe same thing is true for doctors, Web sites, T-shirt shops, sushi restaurants, thumbtack manufacturers, and brands of blank CD-ROM disks. There are 100 major brands of bottled water. Someone opened a fancy ice-cream parlor in Manhattan, and then there were six.\nIf it\u2019s remotely digital (like music), then it\u2019s easy to mimic. And if it\u2019s easy to mimic, someone wins if they can knock off the original\u2013the sooner the better. When someone starts to sell exactly what you sell but for half the price, how long does your good-service, first-mover, nice-person advantage last?\nZara, the fast-growing European clothing store, can knock off a new fashion before the original designer even gets it to the upscale department stores. Suddenly, the original appears to be the copy.\nSo how do you deal with the shortage of scarcity?\nWell, the worst strategy is whining\u2013about copyright laws and fair trade and how hard you\u2019ve worked to get to where you are. Whining is rarely a successful response to anything. Instead, start by acknowledging that most of the profit from your business is going to disappear soon. Unless you have a significant cost advantage (like Amazon\u2019s or Wal-Mart\u2019s), someone with nothing to lose is going to be able to offer a similar product for less money.\nSo what\u2019s scarce now? Respect. Honesty. Good judgment. Long-term relationships that lead to trust. None of these things guarantee loyalty in the face of cut-rate competition, though. So to that list I\u2019ll add this: an insanely low-cost structure based on outsourcing everything except your company\u2019s insight into what your customers really want to buy. If the work is boring, let someone else do it, faster and cheaper than you ever could. If your products are boring, kill them before your competition does.\nUltimately, what\u2019s scarce is that kind of courage\u2013which is exactly what you can bring to the market."}]}

Well, I meant to do that, but I walked out instead.\nI arrive at Westchester Toyota and pass two or three salespeople loitering outside. Inside, there were two or three more, sitting in a line of chairs, waiting for the signal from the headmistress at the counter.\nMy guess is that even for a thriving brand like Toyota, most of these guys weren\u2019t paid so much. They were \u2018good\u2019 salespeople, lifers who showed up, did what they were told and closed a sale here and there.\nIt soon became clear that the salesperson who was assigned to me wasn\u2019t \u2018great\u2019. The dealership had messed up: He had no record of my appointment, no file, no history of why I came. But he just punted. He made no effort to engage with me or look me in the eye or empathize with my frustration at the complete waste of time my call yesterday had been. He gave up after about ten seconds, bummed out that he had lost his place in line. So I left.\nDriving home, I started to think about the discontinuity in the graph of salespeople. Discontinuities are interesting, because that\u2019s where you can see how a system works. In this case, it\u2019s obvious that a great salesperson is going to sell far, far more than a good one. Nine women working together can\u2019t have a baby in one\u00a0 month, and ten good salespeople still aren\u2019t going to close the account that a great one could. That\u2019s because it\u2019s not a linear scale. The great ones reach out. They work the phones when they\u2019re not first in line. They understand what a customer wants. They\u2019re not just better than good. They\u2019re playing a totally different game.\nMy best advice: Fire half your salesforce. Then, give the remainder, the top people, a big raise, and use the money left over to steal the best salespeole you can find from other industries or even from your competition. You\u2019ll end up with fewer salespeople. But all of them will be great.\nAnd the good guys? Have them go work for the competition."}]}

The rage you feel when an improved laptop is announced a week after you bought a new one is an example of this. Your old laptop does everything it used to do, of course, but one reason you bought it was to have the 'best laptop' and the launch of a newer model undoes that for you.\nModern architecture has made many existing office buildings emotionally obsolete, because they are no longer the trophies they used to be. A newfangled digital device for audiophiles doesn't do anything to make old CD players functionally obsolete, but it certainly can shatter the illusion of sound perfection that a stereo lover who doesn't own one may be experiencing.\nStart by realizing that most people who buy a new innovation are not brand new to the market. They buy the new thing as a step up from an old thing. Most hockey equipment is sold to people who already play hockey.\nIt's tempting to argue, logically and step by step, why your new product or service is better than the one that's already on the market. It's far more likely, though, that your story will resonate most with people who aren't seeking functionality but instead were happy with the thing they had, but now, thanks to you, believe it has become obsolete.

What I want is ajunkblocker. A big button on my browser that says \u201cshields up.\u201d And just imagine if it was set to on by default.\nNo celebrity gossip. No conspiracy theories. No weight loss breakthroughs. It would automatically block fist fights, trolling, urgent but unimportant breaking news, insights about the royal family, discussions of whatever happened to a star from thirty years ago, aliens, UFOs, MLMs, the latest pump-and-dump schemes, things that are true but irrelevant, things that are relevant but didn\u2019t actually happen and stories designed to demean, degrade or intentionally inflict distress with little recourse available.\nWhen you put it that way, who doesn\u2019t want a button like that?\nSomehow, we survived as a culture for centuries without exposing ourselves to thousands of profit-driven manipulations dumped on our living room carpet all day, every day.\nNo wonder we\u2019re exhausted after a day online."}]}

I just had two fascinating interactions with the site that point to the good news and the bad news about their future.\nI\u2019ll confess I\u2019m not a Facebook user. I have an account as a way of checking it out, but I\u2019ve \u2018friended\u2019 very few people. Why? Because if I friend you, especially someone I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m giving you explicit permission to start a fairly intense series of interactions. This makes good commercial sense if you\u2019re an insurance salesman or even a musician looking for gigs, but if you\u2019ve got a limit on the time you can invest, it\u2019s not only time-consuming, it\u2019s a recipe to bitterly disappoint people. I\u2019m amazed at people who claim to have a thousand friends on FB. Friendship is a little like the Navy. Either you\u2019re in or you\u2019re out.\nWhat I\u2019ve recently discovered is that even myrealfriends, the handful I\u2019ve got on my list, aren\u2019t so good at answering messages (at least messages from me). Three out of the last four people I pinged, folks that would always answer a phone call or an email, haven\u2019t written back. That\u2019s probably because my generation hasn\u2019t figured out how to filter, prioritize and work with the incoming the way we have with email.\u00a0 This test group appears to have fallen into the trap of accepting friend requests because they didn\u2019t want to offend people and now they\u2019re overwhelmed with noise, all of it at precisely the same level of urgency. There\u2019s no doubt that technology will come up with a far better solution\u2013networked friend-based messaging ought to be super smart and efficient.\nThe flipside? A friend got into college last week. The university gave her a list of the kids from our state who also got in. Within 24 hours, they were all friends. ALL of them! They knew who knew who, what they looked like, what their histories were. Facebook to the rescue. A new network built on the old network within minutes. By the time September rolls around, they won\u2019t need college, they\u2019ll need a reunion."}]}

Another tip: put in a clause appointing a trusted third party as an arbitrator, so small disagreements don't snowball into litigation."}]}

It was about the upcoming US Senate vote about filibusters. Ostensibly, this was a thoughtful, public-radio exposition of the facts and thoughts behind each side of the debate. It was nothing of the sort.BRILLIANTThat\u2019s the only word to describe David\u2019s approach. He told a story about fairness. He used phrases like, \u201cup or down vote\u201d and \u201cnominees who have been held hostage for four years\u201d and \u201cwhat\u2019s in the Constitution.\u201d He spoke calmly and reasonably and never wavered from the story he wanted to tell. If you were inclined to believe his story, it was easy to believe. More important, it was easy to spread.INCOMPETENTRalph Neas approached it like a Moot Court debater. He talked about how Robert Byrd\u2019s previous motions (fifteen years ago) were fundamentally different. Who exactly cares about Robert Byrd? He talked about how the Republicans had filibustered forty (forty!) years ago with Abe Fortas. Ralph may very well have been right about the facts, but it doesn\u2019t matter, does it?[When marketers talk about politics (and when politicians talk about marketing) it almost always ends up as a degraded conversation because people get emotional over their points of view.

What I\u2019m talking about is the consistent bungling of the Democratic Party as they fail to tell stories that people want to hear.]John Kerry lost to an unpopular incumbent seeking reelection for just one reason: he insisted on focusing on facts, on issues, on position papers and on nuance. He acted like an intellectual bully, refusing to worry about the story he told. George W. Bush, on the other hand, was absolutely masterful in the way he told a story that a portion of the electorate wanted to hear.It may be, that like me, you wish that all issues were decided on facts and reliable data. They never are. We\u2019re people, not machines, and we believe stories, not facts.Ralph Neas doesn\u2019t appear to understand this. If I had been him, I would have repeated the mantra,Antonin Scaliaover and over again. I would have talked about what will happen if the court has three more Scalia\u2019s on it. I\u2019d tell that story calmly and carefully and repeatedly. Not everyone dislikes Scalia. That\u2019s okay. You\u2019re never going to persuade everyone of anything. What you can do, though, is persuade the persuadable, persuade the people who are choosing to listen and are open to believing the story you want to tell."}]}

Compare this to the originals in Seattle, and the difference is startling.\nThe same goes for the design of a typical McDonald\u2019s.\nApple launched the Mac with about a dozen full-time people working on its development. Today, they have more than a thousand times as many engineers and they haven\u2019t launched a groundbreaking product in a while.\nThe same goes for Google. And Slack.\nIt\u2019s not just famous big brands. Just about every organization hits a point where the pace of innovation slows as scale increases.\nThis happens for a number of reasons, and there are two ways to deal with them.\nTechnical debtis the result of shortcuts taken to get things to work right now. As a result of these shortcuts, the software (or hardware) isn\u2019t easily expandable for future needs.\nHandshake overheadis the result of the simple law of more people. n*(n \u2013 1)/2. Two people need one handshake to be introduced. On the other hand, 9 people need 36 handshakes. More people involve more meetings, more approvals, more coordination.\nCustomer commitmentsare an asset but also a brake on innovation. The customers you already have didn\u2019t necessarily sign up for you to change things.\nPartner preferencesare similar to customer commitments. The partners you work with have their own objectives and pace, the easiest common denominator is \u2018slower.\u2019\nWall Street\u2019s fearis common, but fading a bit. This is the instinct that many institutional investors have to avoid the unknown. \u201cThe stock is going up, don\u2019t blow it.\u201d\nManagerial anxietyis what happens when an operating bureaucracy comes to replace daring leadership. People get promoted because they\u2019re good at their jobs, and innovation isn\u2019t an opportunity, it\u2019s a threat.\nSo, what to do? Ignoring everything above isn\u2019t going to work. Tasking your people to burn all candles at both ends and to change their approach, while also violating the laws of institutional physics is simply not going to work. You\u2019ll hit the wall. Every time.\nThere are two useful options:\nBoring as a strategyis the approach that Apple and a large number of famous brands have taken. As you cross thechasm, the bulk of your new customers don\u2019t want innovation at all. They want promises kept, a lack of surprises and reasonable prices and efficiency. Shipping your improvements on a regular schedule and bringing predictability to your offering allows you to reach more people and make a bigger impact. Small innovations allow an organization to avoid falling too far behind innovative competitors, and it can take decades before the gap is big enough to matter. And then you become Yahoo. Or Chrysler. Or Carvel.\nStructural bankruptcyis a daring alternative. Create a skunkworks. Refactor your code from scratch. Spin off the cash cow and assemble a team to start something new from scratch. The new things probably won\u2019t work at first, but if you do enough of them, your experience and persistence will pay off.\nI\u2019ve faced these choices many times in my career, and neither choice is easy or obvious, but the choice itself shouldn\u2019t be ignored. If you simply hope for the best of both worlds, you\u2019re likely to be frustrated at the same time you disappoint the people you work with and serve."}]}

Today, YouTube is filled with videos with no views at all.\nAnd books from major publishing houses used to be assured of at least 20,000 copies in print and perhaps would find some loyal readers. Today, when anyone can write and publish an ebook, there are many that have fewer than ten sales.\nWhile this open marketplace of creativity led to some broken hearts among creators, it also opened the doors for new ideas, new voices and a path to making it as a creative person.\nWhich brings us to scientific studies.\nTo get tenure, to spread an important idea, to gain status with colleagues, a scientific paper needed to be published in one of the dozens of journals that existed for this purpose. While there were some studies that were sloppy or even fraudulent, most peer-reviewed journal articles were probably worth taking seriously, with further inquiry appropriate when something important was at stake.\nToday, 87.4% of the self-published and popular science articles available contain stats that are made up and methods that can\u2019t hold up to scrutiny. They know that few people will bother to read the footnotes.*\nIf the goals are speed and clicks, it\u2019s hard to also create a study that\u2019s truly meaningful.

Did they show their work? Have reputable peers referred to the study? What does the person publishing the study have to gain?\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that there are very few breakthrough studies in areas like aerodynamics, perpetual motion and bridge design.

Because, in fact, that's what's actually happening.\nWhat would happen if casting directors and football scouts didn't agonize about their final choice, but instead spent all that time and effort widening the pool to get the right group to randomly choose from instead? (And in fact, the most talented casting directors are in the business of casting wide nets and signing up the good ones, not in agonizing over false differences appearing real\u2013perhaps that's where the word 'casting' comes from).\nIt's difficult for the picked, for the pickers and for the institutions to admit, but if you don't have proof that picking actually works, then let's announce the randomness and spend our time (and self-esteem) on something worthwhile instead."}]}

We brought all our job-winning tools under one roof and gave them away\u2026 that\u2019s over $250 or more in value for free. The idea was that we would use a TV model and let google adsense become our income stream. Now here\u2019s what we found: the sign up rate went up only fractionally more than when we used to charge for the individual components (and that is based on our most popular item, an ebook called job secrets revealed).\nNow here\u2019s the best bit\u2026 revenues fell through the floor. People just weren\u2019t clicking the ads\u2026 and I\u2019m going to share with you a stunning lesson we learned from adsense in a minute.\nAnyhow, I saw your blog and I was thinking about all of this and then I thought to myself, here is what Seth is going to say:\n\"you guys just don\u2019t have a good relationship with your clients etc etc\"\nThe difference for us is that we were trying to give away something that already exists, for free, to people that knew us and already had it\u2026 OR \u2026 to people that had no idea what or who we were. In \u2018forty to one\u2019, on the other hand, you are giving away a NEW idea and book to people who like what you do and want more and they don\u2019t have a copy of \u2018knock knock\u2019.\nSo we abandoned the FREE model and started to charge for it again and our sign-up rate increased\u2026 I guess that in some cases FREE means that it has no value. We did get a few comments from people saying that they were always waiting for a \u2018catch\u2019 on our free site. You know, sign up for free but if you want the really good stuff it will cost you $$$\u2026 so they were amazed when this never came.\nJust thought I\u2019d share the experience.\nThanks for the note\u2026 my take is actually this:1. if it costs money, many people value it more highly.2. if it costs money, many more of the \u2018buyers\u2019 pay an increased amount of attention.3. if it costs money, you get a better shot at future interactions, because the stakes are higher\nThat\u2019s one reason why college degrees are worth more than reading a lot of books in the library, say, or even work experience.\nThe real question here is order of magnitude. If charging for something online only cuts your volume in half, it\u2019s almost certainly worth it. But as more and more outlets are training people that good stuff can be free, it\u2019s going to get harder to sell digital information.\nAs for ads, clearly there are some topics and some audiences that are far more likely to click on ads than others.

How else to get you to spend $5,000 a gallon for perfume?\nHope can be something as trivial as convenience. I hope that this smaller size of yogurt will save me time or get a smile out of my teenager\u2026\nAnd love? Love gets you to support a candidate even when he screws up or changes his mind on a position or disagrees with you on another one. Love incites you to protest when they change the formula for Coke, or to cry out in delight when you see someone at the market wearing a Google t-shirt.\nPeople take action (mostly) based on one of three emotions:\nFearHopeLove\nEvery successful marketer (including politicians) takes advantage of at least one of these basic needs.\nForbes Magazine, for example, is for people who hope to make more money.\nRudy Giuliani was the fear candidate. He tried to turn fear into love, but failed.\nFew products or services succeed out of love. People are too selfish for an emotion that selfless, most of the time.\nIt\u2019s interesting to think about the way certain categories gravitate to various emotions. Doctors selling check ups, of course, are in the fear business (while oncologists certainly sell hope). Restaurants have had a hard time selling fear (healthy places don\u2019t do so well). Singles bars certainly thrive on selling hope.\nGoogle, amazingly quickly, became a beloved brand, something many people see as bigger than themselves, something bigger than hope. Apple lives in this arena as well. I think if you deliver hope for a long time (and deliver on it sometimes) you can graduate to love. Ronald Reagan was beloved, even when he was making significantlong-termerrors. So wasJFK.Hillary may be respected, but Obama is loved.\nI don\u2019t think love is often a one way street, either.

Thanks to everyone whoresponded\u2026\nThe first book isPermission Marketingand virtually all the questions were the same, best summarized by Brandon Carroll, \"How do you feel like Permission Marketing has changed since the 90s when you wrote it? How can it be applied in today's fast changing world?\"\nIf you haven't read it yet, here is somecontext. I wrote it in 1998, before YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Psy, the iPhone or the bankruptcy of Hostess.\nI felt confident writing the book because there were two key shifts that hadn't drawn enough attention:\n1. For the first time in fifty years, paid advertising was no longer growing as an effective, dependable way to buy attention from the people you wanted to reach. Instead, there was an explosion of cheap and even free ways to make noise. And\u2026\n2. For the first time in history, it was possible to directly reach people you wanted to reach, presuming that they wanted you to reach them. And you could do it for free.\nIf anything, both of these trends have accelerated. Most big companies now spend far more time than they ever spent before on advertising engaging in its free alternative. They tweet and post and ping and poke and generally put on an ever-noisier show, all based on the self-delusion that they can actually get back to 1968 and the ability to reach everyone, whenever they want. This is obviously a futile endeavor, but it's not stopping people who should know better from trying.\nAt the same time, a very rare and precious communications channel is being understood and refined.The ability to whisper.The opportunity to be missed. Replacing hype with permission, with an audience of believers who will go ahead and spread the word for you, because they want to, not because you pay them to.\nAnd so, banner ads went from $50 cpm to less than 1% of that, because they're not, in fact, as effective as TV ads used to be. I was being hyperbolic 13 years ago when I said that they would disappear, but they've certainly vanished as the next-big-thing, either for marketers or for media companies. The movement of money spent on mass advertising to mass banners online isn't a smooth one, because it's a shift from mass to micro, from brand advertising to direct response.\nNo big brand has ever been built using banners. And so, the biggest brands built in the last decade (make any list you want, from Red Bull to Google) did not get that way using marketing that Don Draper would have recognized\u2026\nThe biggest mis-fire from my original book, the thing I didn't understand well enough, is how nuanced the pursuit of permission would become. Online games and loyalty programs haven't disappeared, but they're not even close to the most important foundation of this asset. No, it comes down to our need to be included, to be respected and to be connected. Over and over, marketers that have touched this asset have raced to push it too hard and too fast, and along the way,lostthe very permission they worked so hard to get.\nThe other mistake I made was underestimating how much fun it is to act like a big advertiser or a big media company, and how profitable it is to keep that industry moving forward. As a result, there are ever more techniques and ever more tools to act as if you're doing brand advertising in the new media space, when of course, the results are a mere shadow of what you used to be able to do with TV.\nFor the individual or small organization, all the social networks provide you with a fork in the road. Either you can work around the edges, spamming your way to more followers and more noise, figuring out how to make some sort of make-believe metric increase as a result of your efforts. Or, you can use these networks as a new form of 1:1 interaction, making promises and keeping them. This second path means that your followers are actually followers and that your friends are closer than ever to becoming friends.\nGoing forward, the organizations to bet on are the ones with a tribe, with a direct connection. If it's easy to get your Kickstarter funded, if it's easier to get your email opened, then you've built something, something that lasts."}]}

This is a small-group process that works online, designed to help people move from here to there\u2014to stand up and become the leaders and the game changers they want to be.\nI've spent the last six months designing this program and building the team that will organize it. My goal hasn't varied: to help peopleleap, to make change that matters in themselves and those around them. Along the way, I discovered that the magic to creating this change is in peer-to-peer connection as well as hands-on projects. You will remember (and be changed by) your fellow students.\nDETAILS:\u00a0The altMBA is difficult, time-consuming and expensive ($3,000). It\u2019s personal. The time and passion you put into it are truly scarce resources. Only 100 people will be admitted to a section, and the first section begins in June. \u00a0Students are admitted by rolling admissions(first-come, first-served)and applications for the first session are due byMay 17th.\nYou can read the extensiveFAQshere, and find the application link on the FAQ as well. [Landing page is UPDATED with a newvideoas well]. [Here's my friendIshita'stake.]\nThe plan is that you will work harder than you\u2019ve previously worked online. In return, you\u2019ll find a significant amount of support, appropriate tools and most of all, work that matters.\nGROUPS: The focus of the program is on group work, leveraging the power of your peers in order to extend yourself, both by learning from and teaching others. We\u2019re building a cohort of people who will challenge each other to go further than they ever expected. Not merely during the course of the month, but for decades to come.\u00a0The expectation is that you will spend far more time working with your fellow students than you will consuming the public online content.\nSCALE: We\u2019re going to severely limit our growth\u2013the goal isn\u2019t to be big, it\u2019s to change things. Every section of one hundred will have several dedicated coaches. You will be seen and recognized and supported.\nYes, the altMBA is not for everyone, but it might be for you. And if you know someone who might benefit, I hope you'll share this with them.\nClickhereto see all the details of the program and to apply.

The first few hours of the day includes a very fast-paced overview of ideas from Permission Marketing, Unleashing the Ideavirus, Purple Cow, Free Prize Inside and All Marketers are Liars. The focus will be on laying out a framework that is easy to explain to your peers and your boss.\nAfter that, the agenda is driven by the audience. Each person gets a chance to talk about her business or her website or a particular marketing issue. I address each of them, one by one, and the audience quickly gets the hang of a particular approach to problem solving (that would, ahem, bemyapproach). The goal is to get the group to the point where it\u2019s really clear what to do before you even hear my riffs.\nIn the past, seminar attendees have included everyone from major inkjet printer companies to political candidates to non-profits. We\u2019ve had giant companies from Chicago and one-person operations from South Korea. In just about every case, people leave energized\u2013and send me notes a week or a month or even a year later about how their perspective was changed, and how it\u2019s paying off.\nThe thrill for me is in assembling a group of people who believe they have little in common\u2026 and watching everyone in the room gradually \"get it\", realizing how the new marketing techniques change so many things in their organization. If I can do that, if I can send you home ready and able to grow fast if you want to, then it\u2019s been a good day.\nSeats are really limited, so if you want to come, please sign up soon.

I knew after I posted the list I found that I\u2019d hear from a bunch of bloggers asking to be added. Alas, I don\u2019t have the time or the energy (or even the skill) to figure out which ones to add, so I decided to make it an open list.\nYou may have heard the expression, \"everything in moderation.\" I wonder if it needs to be, \"everything needs a moderator.\"\nThe open list doesn\u2019t seem to work in porous, anonymous communities where there is a lot of self-interest involved. The potential for bad actors to spoil it for everyone else is quite large. (The lists that have been posted on other lenses that are focused onegolesstopics are attracting fewer visitors but get more thoughtful votes).\nSeveral bloggers worked hard to game the list I posted, instructing folks to vote other (worthy) blogs down. That\u2019s sad.\nSeveral bloggers added their blogs even though they were clearly irrelevant to the point of the list.\nAnd many bloggers got their feelings hurt because if there\u2019s a list, and you\u2019re competitive, then being near the bottom of the list is a bad thing.\nNo good deed goes unpunished, I guess.\nMy intent from the beginning was not to game technorati nor to create a competitive environment for bloggers. It was simple: to provide a platform with traffic that would make it easy for good blogs on marketing and similar topics to get read. I still believe that we need that. I\u2019m hopeful that with a moderator (and some changes to the plexo algorithm, which we\u2019re instituting over the next week or two) we can accomplish that.\nSo, I\u2019m looking for a moderator.

Often, but not always, these people are happy to hear the following answer.\n1. If you fund your company, even a little, you\u2019ve just sold it. Maybe not today, or tomorrow, but one day. That\u2019s because rational investors are funding your company in the expectation that you are going to sell it and make them a profit. (sure there are exceptions, but not many). So, if you don\u2019t expect that your company will be easy to sell for a big profit, or you don\u2019t ever want to sell your company, it\u2019s not a smart idea to raise money for it.\n2. Most companies are not appropriate sites for VC money. That\u2019s because they\u2019re freelance ventures, not entrepreneurial ones. A freelance venture is one where you work to get paid. An entrepreneurial one is where you can make money while you sleep. Meaning that you work really really hard and you scale and suddenly you own real estate or media properties or technology or a system or a brand that people pay for without you actually doing any incremental work yourself.\n3. One friend ran a very successful specialty school. He decided he wanted to start a division that would sell books about his system. The numbers on the publishing side were terrific (on the spreadsheet). The investors wanted 40% of the existing business in order to put up sufficient money to recapitalize everything and bring big company thinking etc. etc. I pointed out that this would not only ruin my friend\u2019s life, but probably cripple the economics of both businesses.\nThe alternative (which might work for you as well) is not to fund the business. It\u2019s to fund theproject.That\u2019s how they fund movies. You don\u2019t get a piece of the studio. You get a piece of Rocky XIV.\nIf you\u2019ve got something that works and you\u2019re ready to go to the next level, consider funding the expansion with the payoff being a scaling piece of the project. Maybe 100% of the proceeds until the investment is repaid, then 25% after that, forever. Oncethatproject pays off, you\u2019ll be able to fund the next project, probably on even better terms. And on and on, with each project having, if you choose, different investors and different payout streams.\n4. The real lesson is this: if you absolutely need a lot of money to do a particular business and the terms you\u2019ll need to accept to get that money are unacceptable, find a new business. Nothing wrong with that. The market might be trying to tell you something."}]}

Some customers gravitate toward the option that offers ease, quality and convenience, while others prefer low price. If you can do both\u2026\nOne way we\u2019ve seen that done is with scale. Many people prefer the big box store to the local merchant. Not only is it often cheaper, but the selection might be dramatically better, the parking might be easier and in some rare cases, the service is better as well. How is this possible? Because volume pays off in almost every way that matters to the customer.\nAnother way is with proprietary insight. If a company has a production process, a patent or some other barrier, they can often deliver something faster and cheaper\u2026 a barrier that a competitor without that shortcut can\u2019t overcome.\nA third way is with herculean effort. When the people who work on the team simply care more. Caring is work, and caring is in short supply. An organization staffed with smart people who care can often run circles around a lazier competitor.\nMost of the time, though, you\u2019re probably unable to rely on one of these approaches. If that\u2019s the case, the next best option is to choose. To actually be better (regardless of price) or to actually be cheaper.

One reason is that change represents a threat, a chance for things to go wrong. It's no wonder that many people avoid anything that smells of change.\nAnother reason is that different people in the organization have different worldviews, different narratives.\nConsider the difference between \"offense\" and \"defense\" when confronting a new idea.\nThe person who is playing offense wants to get ahead. Grow market share. Get promoted. She wants to bring in new ideas, help more customers, teach the people around her. Change is an opportunity to further the agenda, change is a chance to reshuffle the deck.\nThe person who is playing defense, though, wants to be sure not to disappoint the boss. Not to drop a ball, break what's working or be on the spot for something that didn't happen.\nEither posture, surprisingly, can lead to significant purchases and change.\nDefensive purchases are things like a better insurance policy, or a more reliable auditor. Offensive purchases include sophisticated new data mining tools and a course in public speaking.\nThe defensive purchaser switches to a supplier that offers the same thing for less money. The offensive posture demands a better thing, even if it costs more.\nNot only are people divided in their posture related to change, they're also in different camps when it comes to going first. For some, buying something first is a thrill and an opportunity, for others, it's merely a threat.\nWhile we often associate defense with late adoption, that's not always true. The military, for example, frequently pushes to buy things before 'the bad guys' do. For example, the internet was pioneered and supported by the defense establishment.\nAnd while you can imagine that some people seeking to make change happen are eager geeks of whatever is new, it's very common for a proven success (a titan) to wait until an idea is proven, then overinvest in putting it to use in order to continue to steamroll the competition. Trader Joe's did this with laser scanners\u2026 They like change, as long as that change is proven to help them win even more than they already are.\nPlay with the graph a little bit and consider who you are contacting and what story you're telling\u2026\n"}]}

These require effort, and there\u2019s probably a finite amount of energy available for these focused choices.\nThat\u2019s why our digital habits matter. Not to save us five or ten minutes a day, but to save us from a few hundred unimportant decisions that break our flow.\nFor example, if instead of trying to come up with a unique and original password every time you use a new service, you use a password manager, your load just got lighter.\nIf you adopt a file naming system (each version gets a number, from 1 to X, so the latest file always has the highest number before its name) then you won\u2019t hassle with trying to figure out which is the most recent version.\nIf you use the sidebar in your file finder to put shortcuts to the folders you use often, you won\u2019t burn energy finding your way through nests of folders, again and again.\nWhen I worked at Yahoo, they were embarrassed to share the fact that the most clicked-on button on the entire site was the Yahoo logo (which did nothing on the home page) and the most searched-for term in their search box was also \u201cYahoo.\u201d People hadn\u2019t figured out what bookmarks were yet, or decided to simply keep clicking around until something worked.\nTen minutes today will save you from 30 decisions every day forever."}]}

We used to watch the same TV shows at the same time, eat the same foods, drive the same car. Given a choice, though, many people take the choice\u2014and so, as the culture fragments, we move away from the center and to the edges.\nHalloween and the Super Bowl are the new secular holidays, the group-mania events that prove we're able to stay in sync. Every year, signed up for it or not, each of us is expected to survive the relentless hype. We see almost a month's worth of never-ending media about the Super Bowl\u2014business articles, travel articles, legal articles, cooking articles\u2014a huge onslaught of content-free noise.\nAnd every year, the commercials disappoint, while the game includes eleven minutes of action over the course of four hours of not so much.\nAnd yet we do it again and again. Because the corporate hoopla is beside the real point, which is a chance for all of us to talk about the same thing at the same time. This is part of what it means to belong.\nWhile the Super Bowl is a large-scale example of this happening across a huge swath of people, these occurences happen often in much smaller tribes as well. The buzz about Fashion Week or CES or the latest from Sundance are micro varieties of the same desire to be in sync. Your customers and your employees want to feel what it feels to do what other people are doing. Not everyone, just the people they identify with.\nIt's easy to be persuaded that this event is somehow about the game, or the coverage or the hype, but it's not. Like Groundhog day, it's a pointless thing we do over and over again, because hanging out with people you care about (even if it's just to eat junk food and talk about how bad the commercials are) is almost always worth doing."}]}

That seems sort of obvious. A toddler might want an orange juice because it's sweet, not because she's trying to avoid scurvy, which might be the argument that moves an intellectual but vitamin-starved sailor to take action.\nSo far, so good.\nThe difficult part isthis:Even when people making an argument know this, they don't like making an argument that appeals to the other person's alternative worldview.\nWorth a full stop here. Even when people have an argument about a political action they want someone else to adopt, or a product they want them to buy, they hesitate to make that argument with empathy. Instead, they default to talking about whytheybelieve it.\nTo many people, it\u00a0feels manipulative or insincere or even morally wrong to momentarily take the other person's point of view when trying to advance an argument that we already believe in.\nAnd that's one reason why so many people claim to not like\u00a0engaging in\u00a0marketing. Marketing is the empathetic act of telling a story that\u00a0works, that's true for the person hearing it, that stands up to scrutiny. But marketing is not about merely sharing what you, the marketer believes. It's about what we, the listener, believe.\nMore on thishere."}]}

The paperback Kindle. Don't worry about touchscreens or color or even always available internet to download new books. Make a $49 Kindle. Not so hard if you use available wifi and simplify the device. Make it the only ebook reader in town.\n2. The Kindle as razor. Buy any 8 bestselling books on the Kindle ($10 each) and get a paperback Kindle for free.\n3. Kindle of the month club. In the 1950s, the most powerful person in all publishing was the guy who chose the book for the book of the month club. It didn't pay the author glamorously well, but if your book was chosen, it guaranteed people would talk and it would become a bestseller.\nSign up to get a Kindle book of your choice every month for 12 months and get a free Kindle. Amazon presents you with ten book choices, and since the cost of delivering it is zero, there's plenty of margin for all\u2026\n4. Let publishers, leaders and corporations push PDFs and chosen books directly to their tribes via the Kindle. For example, I could put Kindles in the hands of the 1,000 service techs of my ventilation company and they'd see the new service manual daily. Or an author could create her own version of a book club, collecting a monthly fee and pushing the latest book directly to people who want to read it. Simpler still, how about letting me gift a book directly to anyone I know who has a Kindle? (thanks Lisa, for this idea).\nThe only way to get authors and publishers to embrace this device is to sell 20,000,000 of them. You either become the best and only platform for consuming books worth buying or you fail. And the only way to create that footprint in the face of an iPad is to make it so cheap to buy and use it's irresistible.\nI saw a two-year old kid (in diapers, in a stroller), using an iPod Touch today. Not just looking at it, but browsing menus and interacting. This is a revolution, guys."}]}

One route went through Harvard Square, with its magical campus, and then via bus down youth-friendly Mass. Ave., past Steve\u2019s famous ice cream parlor and on to the small school. The other route, the route the admissions office suggested when I called them, went through gritty Lechmere, then by bus past wood-frame houses built in the 1950s, then some more grittiness and then on to the back of the campus.\nIt would have been easy to use the feelings that the second route created in me, a solo traveler barely 17 years old, to invent a narrative about what was missing from this choice of school.\nWe like to think we make complicated decisions based on rational analysis, but most of the time, we actually make an emotional decision and then invent a rational analysis to justify it.\nThat\u2019s why so many kids pick a school based on how it felt to go to a football game there in October.

A favor, after all, is an investment in a future  relationship.\nAt the famous old-school pizza joint, they act as if they're doing  just about everyone a favor. No need to answer the phone nicely or smile  or add just a little bit extra to that pie. (Godin's first law of pizza  joints: quality is often inversely proportional to niceness). Whether  or not they are actually doing you a favor by selling you this pizza,  they believe they are, and act accordingly.\nOn the other hand, when your buddy Lorne Michaels does you a favor  and gets his friend Steve Martin to stop by your kid's birthday party,  it's really obvious that a favor is being done. So you bend over  backwards, you're dancing at the edge of obsequiousness, putting as much  extra on the table as you can get away with. After all,he's doing you a favor.\nAnd most of the time, it's the third category: business as usual. My  hope is that during business as usual, you're aggressively  overdelivering, but still, it's not like they're doing you a favor by  transacting with you. It's an exchange, a sustainable transaction, where  both sides win.\nThe disconnect happens when one party in the transaction thinks he's  doing the other guy a favor\u2026 but the other guy doesn't act that way in  return. In fact, when both sides think they're doing the other a favor,  it's a meltdown. (The flipside, on the other hand, is great\u2013when both  sides act as if the other guy is doingthema favor.)\nThe shortcut to success is this: why not always act as if the other guy is doing the favor?"}]}

That means a surcharge on the special lobster appetizer or a small extra fee for better service. It means coming up with ways to not actually be \"all inclusive\", to give the customer less unless they pay you more.\nThe goal of this method is to come up with goods and services that have a low marginal cost (your cost of getting or delivering one more) and a high marginal value (what it\u2019s worth to the customer). So, if you can charge the best members of your club a $500 fee for attending a networking event that only costs you $3 a person to host, you\u2019re going to see a large increase in profit.\nThe second wayis to figure out how to give your customers more. To be even more \"all inclusive\" than the competition. To find countless items of low marginal cost and just include them. Why? Because it creates return visits from your existing base, and even better, is a significant investment in word of mouth, the most effective marketing available to you.\nThe Beaches resort in Jamaica prides itself on great people (true) and on being totally all inclusive (not so true). I was there for a few days for a family reunion and it was pretty clear to me that an MBA on a mission was at work. The nickel and diming adds up. He had scoured the place to find ways to charge just a little (or a lot) more as often as possible.\nWifi is a great example. The marginal cost of hosting one more person on a wifi network is as close to zero as something can be. Charge people more than $10 a day and suddenly you\u2019re making hundreds or thousands of dollars of extra profit. Or promise free scuba, but charge people $70 for a checkout course before you let them dive\u2026 low marginal cost, high incremental profit.\nI have no doubt that this works in the short run. It might even work out to be a viable marketing strategy in some markets. However, the alternative is worth considering.Not only do everything you say you\u2019re going to do, but do more.\nOffering low marginal cost items for free is a shortcut to generating word of mouth, which is a lot cheaper than buying ads."}]}

Case in point: the $100 gift card, now available from banks, from stores, even in a rack at the supermarket.\nLast year, more than $8,000,000,000 was wasted on these cards. Not in the value spent, but in fees and breakage. When you give a card, if it doesn\u2019t get used, someone ends up keeping your money, and it\u2019s not the recipient. People spent more than eight billion dollars for nothing\u2026 buying a product that isn\u2019t as good as cash.\nAlong the way, we bought the story that giving someone a hundred dollar bill as a gift (\"go buy what you want\") is callous, insensitive, a crass shortcut. Buying them a $100 Best Buy card, on the other hand, is thoughtful. Even if they spend $92 and have to waste the rest.\nThe interesting thing about stories is that the inconsistent ones don\u2019t always hold up to scrutiny. Consumer Reports and others are trying to spread a different story. One that sounds like this:\nGift cards are for chumps.\nIf enough people talk about this new story, people will be embarrassed to give a gift card. It\u2019s a waste. It\u2019s a scam. It\u2019s a trap for the recipient.\nThe irony is that the gift card companies could easily spend, say, half the profits and create a wonderful, better story\u2026 where every $100 gift card also generates two or three dollars for a worthy cause. That would resonate with a lot of people\u2026 But I think it\u2019s unlikely.\nIf I were a creative non-profit, I\u2019d start marketing alternative gift cards.

An episode of the much-talked-about TV show Succession was seen by about 3,000,000 people when it aired, compared to an episode of Gilligan\u2019s Island or the Monkees, which reachedfifteen timesas many people in the US with each episode.\nAnd the US, of course, is about 5% of the world.\nThe size of the swirl doesn\u2019t have to change the way it makes us feel if we\u2019re in the middle of it. If you were one of the half a million people at Woodstock, or the 7,000 who saw the Dead play in Binghamton, that moment belongs to you and the people there. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s universal. It might be important to the people there precisely because it isn\u2019t.\nOver time, the Beatles sold more than a billion dollars in albums. They made movies, transformed hairstyles, clothing and attitudes about generational shift. Their work connected people worldwide in a way that few cultural forces before them had and few have since.\nAnd it probably felt just as exciting to see them live as it did to go to a Taylor Swift show.\nIt\u2019s true that no Taylor Swift album has outsold the hit albums by Hootie & The Blowfish or Metallica. But the long tail has transformed the record business since its peak.\nAnd the long tail keeps getting longer. The singular cultural touchstones of a generation or two ago are unlikely to be repeated. Our experiences with worldwide events or local performances are now much less likely to be uniform.\nWe all tuned into the same channels. Then we didn\u2019t."}]}

I'm told that every other poster in the series has sold out its pre-sale allocation, and my guess is that while resales will be rare, they'll go up in value.\nTotem poles have been around for a long time, because they work. We need a place to tell our stories, and a reminder of what to talk about. I think it's really cool to start a conversation with something that hangs on the wall. Years ago, I visited the offices of DC Comics and noticed some plaster on the wall of the conference room. That's when I noticed a hand (Superman's hand) punching through the dry wall. It changed the conversations that got held in that room. Most products (or even services) could turn into totem poles if you worked at it. I'm sort of amazed at how little this idea has been leveraged.\nHugh's latest print made me blush. He asked me for permission to do the cover of Purple Cow, a book he found inspirational. I agreed to let him take a shot, and here it is. The book exists for people to talk about it, so this is perfect. I told Hugh that my readers needed hear about it first, but Hugh's posting his take on it in a few minutes.\nEvery penny of my share of the project goes to roomtoread.org. My hope is that this project alone will pay for most of a school in a small village that really needs one. If you're looking for a big purple totem pole, here you go. It's up to you whether to hang it in the portrait or landscape view. Thanks Hugh!\nPS I'm signing each print, and so is Hugh."}]}

Citizens (at the time, just the white men) came together and worked through the town\u2019s agenda. Each person could speak, each person could vote, it was direct and sometimes effective.\nPart of the innovation was the idea that each vote was equal, regardless of how much land you owned or wealth or status you had acquired. (Conveniently ignoring all the souls left out of the meeting.)\nWhen there\u2019s no representative to blame, the responsibility feels different. When everyone in the room can speak, there\u2019s also an expectation that people will listen as they wait their turn. The entire endeavor only works if people are willing to engage and seek mutual success.\nWe agree to speak with care, to listen to others, to change our minds when useful and to abide by the will of the majority. That\u2019s a lot.\nIt\u2019s not unusual for companies to have an event, as often as weekly, that they call a town hall. But this is different. It\u2019s largely a performance, not a conversation among peers. Everyone very muchdoesn\u2019tget a vote. This is a feature of the corporation, not a bug. We label the roles with power, and clearly put them on a chart.\nTraditional Town Halls require each participant to understand their responsibility as well as the power of their vote. They use cultural cohesion and the permanence of real estate in a small town to create civility and mutual respect. It\u2019s not surprising that they don\u2019t scale very well.\nWhen a company actually wants the opinions of those who work there, there are far more effective ways to have a productive conversation around the insights and desires that we each bring to the organization. Asynchronous and structured, these interactions are vital sources of connection and wisdom.\nI\u2019m all in favor of a well-run company meeting.

Less than 20 hours later (thanks to the miracles of 15-hour non-stop flights and many time zone changes) I was at the local Toyota dealer, watching the sales manager working hard to avoid talking to me (or even acknowledging my presence) about how they hadn\u2019t finished servicing my car after a week.\nGiven the ubiquity of cell phones and the internet, outsourcing this gentleman and his three service consultants to India would be very easy. Instead of having people manning terminals in high-cost Rockland, NY, you\u2019d have 10 people answering the phones (and inputting the same data) in India. More access for less money.\nI have no doubt it would create savings. I\u2019m also pretty sure it wouldn\u2019t add much value.\nIt wouldn\u2019t add value because reducing the cost of an interaction with a consumer isn\u2019t usually the point. The real win is when a service person does the difficult work of solving problems and the essential work of connecting with people as individuals. You can\u2019t outsource this easily.\nYou\u2019ve heard it before: every single interaction is an opportunity to do marketing, not a chance to cut costs.\nPS in addition to owning the water buffalo, the young man in India ran a micro-business in coordination withDrishtee,while others I worked with on my trip were part ofScojoand some other very cool organizations.

(You should.)\nBlog: Twenty years ago, only big companies and TV stars worried about media channels.\nOprah was on TV, then she added radio. Two channels. Then a magazine.\nPepsi set out to dominate TV with their message, and billboards and vending machines. Newspapers, not so much. The media you chose to spread your message mattered. In fact, it could change what you made and how you made it. [Stop for a second and consider that\u2026 the media channel often drove the product and pricing and distribution].\nToday, of course, everyone has access to a media channel. You can create a series of YouTube videos, or have a blog. You can be a big-time tweeter, or lead a significant tribe on Facebook.\nHarder to grapple with is the idea that the media channel you choose changes who you are and what you do. Tom Peters gives a hundred or more speeches a year, around the world, for good money (and well earned). But this channel, this place where he can spread his message, determines what he does all day, impacts the pace of the work he does, informs all of his decisions.\nOprah lives a life that revolves around a daily TV show. Of course it would be difficult for her to write a book\u2026 that's a life dictated by a different channel. And she's a lapsed twitter user because it demands a different staffing and mindset than she has now.\nThis applies to non-celebs, to people with jobs, to entrepreneurs, to job seekers. We all spread our ideas, at least a little, and the medium you choose willchangeyour ideas. If you only pay attention to the world when you need a new job (your channel is stamps and your message is your resume) you'll spend your day differently than if you are leading a tribe, participating in organizations or giving local speeches all the time.\nWe've come a long way from a worker having just two channels (a resume and a few references) to having the choice of a dozen or more significant ways to spread her ideas. Choose or lose."}]}

They listen and send the notes up the chain. They're at the front line, and they listen to what's happening and figure out how to get the right people back home to hear what's being said.\n2. They apologize. Not for things they did wrong, but for things that others did wrong.\nIf you work for a company that you don't own, if you interact with customers, you're a brand ambassador. The person who runs the cash register or answers the phone or makes sales calls is a brand ambassador, in the world on behalf of the amorphous brand, whatever that is.\nI recently bought a few shirts from a big chain. They left the anti-theft tags on the shirts, which of course meant a drive and a hassle to go back to a different store in the chain to get them taken off.\nChallenge number one is that the disrespected, overworked cashier will never be asked about what she learned from her interaction with me. There's nothing in place for information to flow.\nAnd challenge number two is that she steadfastly refused to apologize for the hassle. It wasn't her fault, she knew, so what was there to apologize for?\nWe invented ambassadors because nothing can replace face to face interaction, particularly when messages travel sometimes quite slowly through complex organizations. Just like now.\nThis seems obvious, and it is, until you realize that organizations make two huge mistakes:\nA. They don't hire brand ambassadors, they hire clerks and bureaucrats, and treat them and pay them accordingly.\nand\nB. They don't manage and lead brand ambassadors, don't measure and reward and create a cadre of people who can listen for the brand and speak for the brand.\nWould you send the clerk on aisle 7 to speak to a head of state or vital partner on behalf of your company?

Hundreds or thousands of people onboard, and most of them are essential\u2013but most of them aren't actually directly responsible for the work that we hired the battleship to do. Without the fuel people, the navigation team, the folks in the med corps and on and on, it doesn't work.\nThe battleship can go far, with impact, and change the course of history. While it has exactly one captain, it's the synchronized work of more than a million people (when you think about all the machinists and support folks back home) and it works. It does what we ask it to do.\nOne more thing about the people on the battleship: just about everyone has a punchlist, an itemized inventory of what they need to get done. And many of them are rewarded for doing that set of tasks more efficiently, more elegantly and with better quality than expected. Great people means the system works even better, but it's designed to survive with people who are merely good at what they do.\nThe typical professional services company, on the other hand, is a lot like a blueberry pancake. While there's an essential support team, the firm is all about blueberries working in parallel. Each blueberry can work independently, and sometimes they even work on projects that might have conflicting outcomes or views of the world. I don't care how many people report to you. I care about how connected and how brave you are.\nAs the firm gets bigger, it doesn't get thicker. You don't make a better pancake by making a thicker one. You make a better pancake by hiring ever better blueberries.\nAnd, as you've guessed, most of the blueberries don't know exactly what they'll be doing in six weeks, and most don't work from a manual about the industry's best practices on how to do what they do. It's hard to measure blueberries, but a talented and motivated one can also change the world.\nApple is now a battleship. Most of the tens of thousands of people who work there have a line job, selling, building, fixing or interacting. Only a few are dreaming up something that you can't even imagine.\nYour favorite record label, though, ought to be a blueberry pancake. Each musical group is mostly alone, figuring out something that just might work. The goal isn't to lock and repeat and scale. It's to go wide and stay interesting. Great record labels have both better blueberries and the support staff to launch them into the world.\nI remember the day we transformed Yoyodyne from a pancake to a battleship. We hired 17 salespeople in 24 hours (increasing the size of the company by 25%) and for the first time, I didn't know every employee well. People had their orders, and we were ready to scale.\nIf you want to make your battleship work better, be really clear about defining the mission, the tactics, the chain of command and most of all, precisely what you measure from each person on the team.\nYour pancake, on the other hand, gives up swing weight and firepower and instead gets flexibility and the possiblity of non-fatal failure (and game-changing magic).\nBoth work. The problem kicks in when a successful pancake thinks its future is in the battleship business. Or when battleships are asked to dance."}]}

You bought \"enough for now.\" Then you solved the tie problem and moved on.\nWhen you first bought an iPhone, you had an app shortage, so attention was paid to apps. You bought \"enough for now.\" Then you moved on.\nMusic might be an exception (buying a new stereo doesn't often lead to a new music binge). But in general, some external event occurs that creates a fissure, an opportunity, a problem. We search, we buy, we're done.\nThe challenge, then, is to develop products that match what the market is looking for, and more important, to overtly and aggressively seek out the people in that situation and ignore the rest. Which is precisely what most marketers large and small arenotdoing right now.\nRELATED: Many marketers I know have a great idea for a product or service that will target a segment of the market that doesn't know to look for the great idea. For example, you might want to sell a better, easier to use hatchet for women. The problem is that women, long accustomed to never being able to find an axe that they're comfortable with, have given up looking, perhaps several generations ago.\nAlerting a market segment that isn't looking is a thousand times harder than activating a segment that just can't wait for your arrival. Since it's your choice, since the segment is up to you, why not pick one that is itching for you to show up?"}]}

It's far easier to wait until someone is ready to buy than it is to persuade them to buy.\nExcept the answer isn't to poach demand at the last minute. The answer is to redefine the market into something much smaller and more manageable. You don't need to persuade everyone that you have a great idea, you merely need to persuade one person. And then make it easy for that person to share.\nOne last semi-related thought: Wenda Millard quotes a Mercedes Benz exec, \"If the only time I show you a Mercedes ad is just before you're about to buy a fancy car, I've lost.\" The fact is, advertising to build brand and recognition and demand is a very long-term proposition, not something you measure with clicks.\nA last-minute swipe of purchase intent is a tactical win.

Their goal is to get more votes than the other guy. So they obsess about pleasing those that vote. Everyone else is invisible.\nSteakhouses do nothing to please vegetarians who don't visit them, and politicians and their handlers don't care at all about non-voters.\nThe magic of voting is that by opting in to the system, you magically begin to count. A lot.\nIf you don't like negative ads, for example, then vote for the candidate who ran even 1% fewer negative ads. Magically, within a cycle or two, the number of negative ads begins to go down.\nOne reason that people don't vote (a real, usually unspoken reason) is that they don't want to feelresponsiblefor the person who wins. The other reason is that they don't want to live with thedisappointmentof voting for someone who loses. Both of these reasons ignore the marketing reality:not voting doesn't make marketing or politics go away.It merely changes the person the marketers are trying to please.\nVote tomorrow. Bring a friend. If enough smart people start voting again, things will improve, because billions of dollars in political marketing will suddenly be trying to please you."}]}

Meats, cheeses, potatoes\u2026 the typical fare.\nOnce your business hits a natural plateau, it\u2019s tempting to invest in getting more people to come. And what most buffets do is double down.

You haven\u2019t done anything to grow your audience. The base might be a little more pleased, but not enough to bring in any new business. And the disenfranchised (the vegans, the weight watchers, the healthy eaters, the kosher crowd) remain unmoved and uninterested. And one person like this out of a party of six is enough to keep all six\u00a0 away.\nSo, there are two ways to go. Much deeper, or a bit wider.\nDeeper would mean a bacon-focused buffet, a dozen bacon dishes, including chocolate-covered bacon. Deeper would mean a chocolate-obsessed dessert bar, ten cakes, fondue, everything.\nDeepergets you people willing to drive across town to visit you. It\u2019s remarkable. It\u2019s not like every other buffet but a little bit bigger. It\u2019s insanely over the top. People will bully their friends in order to get them to come.\nThe other choice iswider. Instead of adding a handful of dishes that mildly please the people you already have, why not add brown rice and tofu and vegetarian chili? Now you\u2019ve opened the doors to that last 15%.\nThis thinking isn\u2019t available only to buffet owners. It works for summer camps. Resorts. Conference centers. Spiritual institutions. It works for any business that seeks to attract customers that come in groups where people have different wants and needs."}]}

This works for Harley-Davidson (and certainly the Hells Angels). It works for the latest teenage trends. It works for some politicians. It even works for some computer operating systems and languages.\nAccording to theTimes,the Zoroastrians are fading away because they believe being good is just about enough and didn\u2019t build enough of the elements of an ideavirus into their culture. As they traveled the world, their attitude and hard work rewarded them with success and the ability to mix with other cultures. As a result, they were successful as a people but a failure as a long-term growing religion. It\u2019s a fascinating choice, isn\u2019t it?"}]}

We need money to create remarkable products and to tell stories that spread. We need it to hire the best people and most of all, to stick it out until our ideas spread.\nWhich is why all but the largest companies need to learn a key lesson of personal finance.\nThis chart shows what happens to two people. The smart person, we\u2019ll call him Gallant, manages to save $100 a month for five years.\nThe other one, we\u2019ll call him Doofus, spends $100 more than he has every month.\nAfter five years, Gallant has almost $7,000 in the bank. Even with only 5% interest, he\u2019s building an asset that keeps him out of trouble with his mother-in-law and gives him the freedom to invest in the next part of his business.\nThe same period of time, Doofus has used his credit cards to finance his debt of $100 a month. That tiny nut has now added up to about $13,000 in 24% credit card debt. And every single month it gets a lot bigger.\nIf this isn\u2019t interesting to you, consider the company that spends $10,000 or $100,000 extra every month.\nA lot of organizations decide to skip the rice and beans and studio apartment step. They decide to \"go big or stay home.\" More often than not, they end up going home.\nI spent many years window shopping restaurant menus and driving all night to get to meetings where the plane cost just a bit too much. I thought at the time that I had no choice, but now I realize that I could have borrowed money on my credit cards and lived a little easier. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t.\nWhen I talk to people who want to become marketers, I almost always tell them to go start something and go market something. The same advice for 15 year olds and seniors. Turning off the TV and building a Cafe Press store is not only free, but it starts to build a professional-skills asset for the long haul. Pay as much as you need to for things that matter, and as little as you can for things that don\u2019t. And never borrow money to pay for something that goes down in value."}]}

The easiest way to do that, of course, is to be authentic. And yet, ever since they replaced the sugar in Coke with corn syrup, who knows any more\u2026 Being inauthentic is tricky, unpredictable and often wrong. But it also works.\nThe fact is, most of the people want to be fooled, just about all of the time.\n[facts galore: Harry points out that the \u2018Lincoln birthplace\u2019 isn\u2019t really.

Besides, such cheeriness, even if feigned, cheers me up first and foremost! Next, and in a way most important, even though I have little trouble infusing my lecture with meaning, I must thoroughly convince myself that this is a day every hour of which is worth savoring!

With menus. With fonts. With things in their proper hierarchy. Once you\u2019re good at this, you can build or tweak a \u2018site\u2019 in no time.\nNow you have a powerful tool. You can use it in presentations, in meetings and even test it with users, all before you do any coding at all. Once you\u2019ve shared this with the team, the question is simple, \u201cif our website works just like this, do you approve of it?\u201d Don\u2019t start coding until the answer is yes.\nThis is a discipline, one that takes a fair amount of guts to stick with, but it pays off huge dividends. Don\u2019t code until you know what you want.\nLast step: Hand the Keynote doc to your developers and go away until it\u2019s finished.\nAs I said, this works for mobile apps too.

Concerned, the leading manufacturers of upright bikes went to the UCI and persuaded them to ban recumbent bikes from competition.\nNearly a hundred years later, the ban continues.\nOf course, most of us will never race in a sanctioned UCI bicycle race.\nBut, the fastest bicyclists are the ones that spend the most time and money on their bikes.

And they\u2019re surrounded by an even larger circle that is inspired by them.\nAnd so the status roles are set, and thus affiliation roles as well. And then systems are built and technology platforms are reinforced and it becomes simpler and easier and more convenient to buy and sell the regular kind. All because of one race 90 years ago.\nConsider what happens when one person (now lost to the clouds of time) decides to alter an algorithm at YouTube.

Over the years, you always saw these plates on certain kinds of cars, driven by certain kinds of guys.\nAnd the cars were another signal. Cadillacs meant one thing, little Cellicas meant another. So how do I explain the fact that just a few years later, I was hanging out with David Filo, multi-billionaire co-founder of Yahoo!, who was driving a Celica or some similarly non-descript econocar.\nThe people in first class are flying with frequent flyer miles, while the Senator is back in coach.

Blogs takes it even further\u2026 bloggers are entire media conglomerates in their pajamas.\nSo, when all the cues are gone, the way we make decisions about who to work with, what to buy and who to believe and trust comes down to this: it\u2019s in the interactions.\nIt\u2019s not the surface flash, the five digit license plate, the brand of car, the cut of the suit or the seat at the table.

They can\u2019t afford to spend time or money with every single person that walks in. So the challenge is to be cheap and easy. If it\u2019s cheap and easy (or quick) to interact with you once, people are more likely to do it. If the first interaction goes well, you get a second shot. You build a relationship, not a sale.\nNo, you never get a second chance to make a first impression.

It was on a beater of a Subaru, naturally.\nThen I noticed that the Wall Street Journal is now running a regular feature on which celebrities and industry luminaries are buying which cars\u2026 and in which cities.\nIt\u2019s a little odd, if you think about it. Here\u2019s one of the biggest purchases the average person makes, and we\u2019re interested in what famous people are endorsing our decision.\nBut then the real question hit me. The car dominates our culture. It has a huge impact on our cities, on our balance of trade, on the environment and world politics. If everyone gave up SUVs and drove a hybrid, we\u2019d essentially be independent of foreign oil and the threat to the atmosphere would virtually disappear (as would asthma, smog, etc.). But almost no one is suggesting this as a potential solution.\nWhy? Because somehow, we\u2019ve marketed ourselves this formula: cars=self-esteem.\nI mean, I love my Miata. I drive it with a smile on my face, and I like to believe that I really drive it the way it was designed to be driven. Of course, SUV users like to justify their purchase in exactly the same way I do. Why do we care so much about what we drive? I certainly don\u2019t give the same thought to my shoes or kind of pen I use. What would happen if there were no choice in car (except the paint job)?\nImagine for a second that all the time and money and competitive drive we put into buying, cleaning, improving, tuning and tweaking our cars needed to be spent in other ways.\nWhat if you could get a big car (a slow van) or a little car (a slightly less slow sedan) and that was it? In our post-industrial age, would this radical government intervention grind capitalism to a halt?\nIn the name of national security, world peace and environmental longevity, it\u2019s an interesting thought exercise, isn\u2019t it?\nFrom a marketing point of view, the discussion is even more interesting. When you take away an expensive option of expressing self-esteem (cars, say), human beings quickly find substitutes. It might be Timberland boots downtown, or Prada bags uptown. Both are ridiculously overpriced for the utility they deliver, but it\u2019s the brand that matters, the label, the image, the peace of mind.\nHow do some marketers create this while others fail?\nI think when traditional marketers talk about \u201cbrand\u201d, this is what they mean. A true brand is something where the self-esteem value far exceeds the utlity. It might be Heinz ketchup or a Rolex watch or a  Marlboro cigarette, but in each case there\u2019s a truly emotional connection between the brand and the user.\nAlas, almost all marketers fail utterly in creating a brand. The allure of a powerful brand (Disney) appears to keep the non-winners (Six Flags) plugging away.\nI\u2019m way off the topic of cars here, but I\u2019m really not. What I\u2019m worried about now are side effects\u2013the unintended consequences of excellent branding. I\u2019m not in favor of the government getting in the middle of this, but I sure wish I could figure out how to market our way out of this problem. It\u2019s one of the great tragedies of our profession, imho."}]}

The science of testing and improving offers and the industrialization of systems that lowered costs meant that more and more organizations were using direct marketing to solicit donations, get votes and sell products and services.\nOne of the key elements that allows direct marketing to grow so fast is that once you know how much an action is worth (a returned phone call, a door opened, an address added) you can buy it from anyone, in any quantity. Because it pays for itself. The media works on commission, for you.\nThe internet, of course, is fueled by direct marketing thinking. What's a click worth? How much will you bid to have your ad on top? How many visits does this buy create? What's the funnel on our site, and how do we make it more efficient? What's the allowable for a download?\nSo Amazon grew largely on the basis of its affiliate program (anyone can join, you only get paid when someone clicks and buys\u2013classic direct marketing thinking). And so Google grew without a salesforce, because the direct marketer doesn't wait for someone to show up and sell\u2013instead, the direct marketer eagerly seeks out anything that generates a click for less.\nThis is the opposite of the other kind, which doesn't really have a name. Brand marketing, or mass marketing, or indirect marketing. The kind the guys at Mad Men do. The full-page ads in magazines, just about all the ads on TV, sponsoring a conference\u2026\n[For the purposes of this post, I'm talking about the duality of marketing in the traditional sense. My take for the last 15 years is that marketing is merely storytelling and promise making/keeping, and in fact, everything the organization does is at some level, marketing.]\nIf you're hoping to build something on the web, then, you're almost certainly required to think like a direct marketer.\nThat means that if you're searching for traffic or action or sales or word of mouth, you will be offered a hundred ways to measure what happens. And if you improve what you're measuring, the amount you have to spend on each action goes up, and if you earn enough from each action, direct marketing becomes a profit center, not a cost.\nThat means if you're required to sell ads or sponsorships, the easiest sales to make, and the most likely sales you'll make, will be to a direct marketer, and the offer is probably similar to Amazon's original affiliate offer: We'll pay you when it works. We'll pay for a click or we'll track how many people type in a discount code, or\u2026\nSometimes eager direct marketers will pay upfront for an ad, but they always measure, and they don't keep running ads that don't measure up. That's at the core of direct marketing.\nThere are costs to this shift, worth thinking about:\n1. While it's tempting to build an organization with direct marketing techniques, just about all the brands that matter to our culture aren't built this way. The subtle and powerful stories behind Starbucks and Apple and Harper Lee don't lend themselves to direct response ads.\nIf you're trying to build that kind of brand, it's essential that you reject direct-marketing tactics as a shortcut. They will drive you to make decisions that keep you from building the sort of promise you seek to build,andthey'll end up not paying for themselves either.\nWhether you're a solo entrepreneur or a giant corporation, this is a trap the web sets for you. What you need to sacrifice to make the numbers work might be the very brand you seek to build.\n2. Open-system direct marketing (where just about anyone can carry a link or run a banner) inevitably destroys the media that gets hooked on them. If your podcast becomes dependent on getting people to visit a sponsor's site and type in the discount code, you can bet that there will be ever-increasing internal pressure to mention the code louder and more often. Not by the advertiser. He doesn't care, he'll just move on. By your partners and your boss. And so we get popups and popunders and sneaky data tracking. Because people are measuring.\n[There is an exception to this, which proves the rule: The Yellow Pages, where responding to the ads is the only function of the medium. Craigslist and eBay understand this.]\nIn many ways, direct marketing on the web is a self-limiting process, because the more that media companies embrace it, the worse it works. This is precisely the opposite of what happened for a generation to branded ads inVogueand other magazines. Work too hard at getting clicks on the ads you sold, your audience leaves.\nLester Wunderman, Lillian Vernon and LL Bean built direct marketing businesses at their kitchen table, buying stamps and mailing lists and learning the hard way how to think like direct marketers. The web has turned all ofus, if we want to be, into direct marketers. Go in with your eyes open, and do it well, and for the right reasons."}]}

They were doing the best they could under the circumstances, of course, but there were units in their organization that needed to be protected, prices that needed to be supported, sacred cows that couldn't be touched. After all, they argued, how could they wipe out their current business just to succeed online?\nThis conversation happens every single day at organizations large and small. You want to do the new thing, but of course you must do it in a measured, rational way.\nWhich is great, unless your competition doesn't agree.\nWhen you have someone who is willing to accomplish A without worrying about B and C, they will almost always defeat you in accomplishing A. Online, of course, this often leads to doom, since there are many organizations that are willing to get big at the expense of revenue, or writers willing to be noticed at the expense of ethics or reputation. But in the short run, the singleminded have a fantastic advantage. And sometimes, their singleminded focus on accomplishing just that one thing (whatever it is) pushes them through the Dip far ahead of you and then yes, they make a ton of money and you've lost forever.\nNewspapers, magazines, TV stations, hardware companies, real estate brokers, travel agents, bookstores, insurance agents, art galleries and five hundred other industries need to think hard about this before it's too late."}]}
