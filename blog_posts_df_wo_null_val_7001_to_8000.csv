Lottery math is human math,"It’s irrational to buy a lottery ticket. And yet, millions do, even more when the prize is huge.
To be clear: buying this lottery ticket is precisely as rational as paying $800 a day for a device to help to avoid being hit by lightning.
So what’s up with this? How do we explain why millions of otherwise sane people will waste $2 entering a lottery that they’re not going to win? And why do it in occasional droves, as opposed to thoughtfully?
Because, for some people, some of the time, the lottery is a bargain. The only person who buys a lottery ticket for $2 is someone who, right now, thinks it’s worth more than that.
Worth more than that for the feeling of possibility, hope or relief that they feel just before they found out they lost, and the feeling goes away, only to return when they play again.
Worth more than that for the pleasure of being part of a mass sensation, at least for a moment.
Worth more than that because the alternative, the gnawing feeling of being left behind, is worth avoiding for just two dollars.
The surprising thing isn’t that we’re irrational about how we spend our time and money. It’s how much effort we put into lying about it.","October 23, 2018","lottery, irrationality, human behavior"
Uphill both ways,"A naive dream is that it’s possible to go on a long bike ride–and enjoy the journey going downhill in each direction.
Newton had it right… you’re going to need to go uphill in order to go downhill.
Too often, though, we set up our projects and our freelance life in a way that makes it always anuphillslog. If you don’t build an asset and don’t invest in your reputation, all you’ve got left is grunt work.
The hard work is digging in deeper than usual on the uphills–that’s the best chance you have to earn a downhill later.","October 22, 2018","freelance, hard work, asset building"
"Social media is a symptom, not a tactic","When your ideas are spreading, when your work is remarkable, when your organization has built a social ratchet that works, one of the side effects will be a significant social media presence. People will talk about you in ways that they like to talk… online.
On the other hand, if you spend all your time beginning at the end, grooming your social network, tweezing your Insta posts, hyping your tweets–nothing much is going to happen.
The simple proof of this is that brands with ten or twenty times the social media impact almost never have ten or twenty times as many people working as “social media specialists.”
And worth noting: The Mona Lisa has a huge social media presence. Her picture is everywhere. But she doesn’t tweet. She’s big on social media because she’s an icon, but she’s not an icon because she’s big on social media.
The narrative of social media grooming is a seductive one, but it’s as much of a dead end as spending an extra hour picking out which tie to wear before giving a speech.","October 21, 2018","social media, branding, influence"
Triggers and cycles,"A trigger prompts a cycle. And a cycle might go on longer than it should.
The first spoonful of ice cream can trigger a cycle of binge eating that you regret later.
The silence of walking into an empty house might trigger you to turn on the TV, and that cycle of wasting time watching nothing that matters goes on all night.
The rush to get out the door leads to a cycle of rushing, which makes your commute a daredevil exercise, one that takes hours to recover from.
It’s really useful to see your cycles and to work to dampen them (it’s almost impossible to go cold turkey).
Even better is to find and eliminate the triggers. That’s surprisingly easy if you care enough. Quit Twitter. Empty your freezer. Wake up ten minutes earlier…
Make these decisions when you’re not in the middle of a cycle.
With the trigger gone, you might discover the cycles are gone too.","October 20, 2018","Triggers, Cycles, Binge Eating"
We are not the enemy (if we try),"Fewer than 1% of our population works hard to divide us. To pit people against one another for their selfish aims.
These are the pundits, divisive politicians, media companies and short-term trolls who have decided that schisms and fights are a good way to achieve their aims.
But if everyone is demonizing the other, then everyone is the enemy to someone.
We end up spending our time fighting each other instead of fighting for the things that really matter. We end up focusing on the current thing while something more important shrinks away in the background.
It’s possible to be fierce, fierce in your dedication to change, to what’s right, to making things better–without finding the source of your power in the destruction of others.
We ought to be fighting inequality, corruption and inefficiency. Working to stamp out ignorance and missed opportunities while creating access and possibility. Keeping our promises and making things better.
Every system is improved when it’s in sync, and the narcissism of small differences is a seduction that keeps us from focusing on creating real value by doing important work.
Realizing that things can get better (they can always get better) opens the door for productive conversations, conversations that aren’t based on prior decisions about what team someone is on, and instead, on putting our shoulder to the work, taking responsibility and actually making things better.
We can fight injustice without becoming pawns in a boxing promoter’s game.","October 19, 2018","Unity, Change, Inequality"
Work that matters for people who care,"That’s the actual title for my new book.

It’s technically called,“This Is Marketing.”
It’s about modern marketing, the way we spread ideas when we care enough to do it with respect, empathy and humility.

Big software/lousy software,"Capitalism is fueled by choice. It’s choice that drives suppliers to do better work, because they know you can pick a competitor. Choice moves power from the supplier to the customer.
Software works as a business. The cost of supporting one more user is very low, and the network effect is a miracle.
Any time someone builds software that works better when others are using it too, the network effect has a chance to kick in. Word dominated because you were better off using the same word processor as your peers, so you could exchange files.
Online, the network effect allows some companies to clear the table, signing up hundreds of millions of users, creating software dynasties.
And then, almost always, the software gets lousy.
Because we don’t have a choice (for now).
Paypal has a notoriously slow and weak search capability. Facebook used its hegemony to get careless about their UI and sloppy about public policy issues. Apple’s software rarely gets significantly improved…
Because we don’t have a choice (for now).
It’s surprising to me that capitalism’s most outspoken supporters aren’t clear about the difference between companies that exist in competitive markets, and those that have achieved lock in. The lock in that comes with the network effect almost ensures that the company will cease to innovate or optimize on the part of the customer. They’re paying attention to costs and profits, not long-term impact or customer satisfaction.
If you believe in free markets, then net neutrality and portability are essential building blocks for the future.
As more and more of our life involves networks (and their effects) a bias toward owning data and having other options in software is the best way we have to make sure we have a say on how we engage with the network.

Learning without doing,"It’s certainly possible.
But it’s unlikely you could learn to ride a bike by watching a lot of videos about it.
Or teach a toddler to walk.
In fact, it’s unlikely that you could learn to sell, to design useful objects or to solve interesting problems either.

“Here we go again”,"We all say that to ourselves.
The question is: when do you say it?
Do you say it when you're being rejected, failing, stuck, panicked, overwhelmed or alone?
Or do you say it when you're engaged, winning, changing things and in the groove?
Because the more you rehearse this feeling, the more it's going to happen.
We get what we expect.
And we expect what we get.
The easiest way to change this cycle is to alter the scale we play in. If you keep failing at the big stuff, it's worth honing the habit of succeeding at the small stuff first. And if you're finding yourself in a rut, a cycle of failure, walk away from that series of projects and find a new field to plant your seeds in.","October 15, 2018","mindset, success, cycle"
"Mirror, mirror","When you see someone walking down the street with new sunglasses on, do you stare at them? Really stare at them, from every angle?
If you're fortunate enough to have a selfie with President Obama, with Bono or with Sarah Jones, what do you look at when you look at the picture? Do you focus on the tie he was wearing, or her earrings? Or are you worried about the bit of parsley that was in your teeth or the ridiculous jacket you were wearing that day?
We like to see.
But mostly, we're worried about being seen.
We spend far more time looking at ourselves in sunglasses than anyone else ever will.
And social media might appear to be about seeing what others are doing. But it's actually about our juxtaposition with those others, our standing, our status… The reason we want to know what people are saying behind our backs isn't because we care about them, it's because we care about us.
The culture of celebrity that came with TV has shifted. It's no longer about hoping for a glimpse of a star. It's back to the source–hoping for a glimpse of ourselves, ourselves being seen.","October 14, 2018","self-perception, social media, celebrity culture"
In and of itself,"Culture is changed by design, and design by culture.
There are things that look ‘right’, and others that don’t. We notice the mistyped word, the straight quote, the lousy kerning.
But then, the paradigm shifts. An illuminated manuscript and a dime-store novel are both books, but neither would look right to someone accustomed to the other.
The challenge of breakthrough design is in doing it with intent. To deliver more, not less of the change you seek to make, the leverage you seek to provide. To do the work with knowledge and care, not laziness or haste.
There’s an internal consistency to breakthrough design. It’s of itself, it reflects the intent of the designer. Copying the status quo is easy, commodity work. Creating a new paradigm, one that resonates, is the real work the designer seeks to offer.","October 13, 2018","design, culture, intent"
Useful constructs,"We find knowledge (and express it) by dividing the world into grids and segments, and explaining how this organization works.
The periodic table is a useful construct.
Useful constructs are replicable and they’re predictive.
If I tell you the rules needed to organize the elements, you’ll come up with the same table as every other scientist.
And if you know where something is on that table, you can make accurate predictions about how the element will behave.
On the other hand, race is not a useful construct. Neither is ethnicity. It’s not a replicable approach—every person who tries to organize other humans by race will come up with a different system. And it’s not predictive—it doesn’t tell us anything about how someone will act going forward.
Engineers build their work around useful constructs. And often, people who are in politics waste their time arguing about constructs that aren’t useful at all.
If we’re going to influence the culture, grow our organizations, lead people and engage in the marketplace, finding useful constructs (as opposed to established superstitions) is essential work.","October 12, 2018","Useful constructs, Predictive models, Organization of knowledge"
Organized for browsing,"In the traditional world, most things are organized so you can find them when you’re looking for them. That’s why you keep your tools in your tool chest and the forks in the silverware drawer. That’s why books are stored in alphabetical order, by author.
But in the digital world, finding is easy. Type what you want in the search bar.
What we’re still exploring, and not very successfully, is how to organize things forbrowsing. How do you bump into the thing you didn’t know you were looking for? How do you decide what your next home improvement project should be, or the next movie you should see?
Dancing along the edge of facilitated discovery is one of the most important frontiers that marketers are challenged to do. And we’re not doing it very well yet.","October 11, 2018","browsing, discovery, organization"
Podcasting is the new blogging,"Not as a way to make big dollars (blogging didn’t do that either). But as a way to share your ideas, to lead your community, to earn trust.
Podcasting is a proven technology that is still in its infancy. It’s an open mic, a chance for people with something to say to find a few people (or perhaps more than a few people) who’d like to hear them say it.
And podcasting is the generous act of showing up, earning trust and authority because you care enough to raise your hand and speak up.
Over the summer, Alex DiPalma ran the Podcasting Fellowship, and I was lucky enough to be invited along to help out.
I was thrilled at the results.
More than 300 people signed up to be part of it, and the creativity was electric. People from all over the world, from 18 years old to 60, learned how to create a podcast they could be proud of. They didn’t just learn. They did it.
Learning the technology is the easy part. It’s the peer support, the community and the bias for shipping that really matter.
Because you asked, we’re going to run it one more time.You can read all the details right here.
Signups and engagement begin today, the lessons (delivered, no surprise, in podcast format) begin a few days later and we close signups on October 15th. It costs about $10 a day, and there’s an early bird discount if you hurry. You can do it at your own pace, and an hour a day is probably enough to get you going (though you can put more into it and get more out of it).
I’ve said before that my decision to blog is one of the best I’ve ever made for my career, for the work I do, and most of all, for my continued posture of teaching and leaping.

Considering the vacancy tax,"Landlords are notorious for having a bias toward raising the rent. They’re in it for the long haul, they’ve seen downturns before, and while they’re quick to raise rents in good times, they are loathe to lower rents, even if it means sitting with an empty storefront for months at a time.
While this math might be compelling for some landlords, it’s terrible for the cities those buildings are located in.
Empty storefronts deny residents accessible services.
They lead to vandalism and other crime.
And they suck the vibrancy from the neighborhood.
They also deprive the municipality from sales tax revenue, cost jobs and take watchful eyes away from the neighborhood as well.
If we view the ability to have a well-cared for, civil neighborhood as a privilege, it’s logical to consider a vacancy tax for landlords as an incentive for them to lower rents when decreased demand happens because retailers can’t afford the old rent.
It could be something like: For any storefront that’s empty, after two months of vacancy, the landlord has to pay a tax of 20% of the average rent they’d be receiving. All the money would go to neighborhood improvements and policing.
Lower rents create new innovations, which leads to more interaction and more vibrant neighborhoods. And in the long run, it gives landlords an incentive to do what actually generates more of what they seek as well.","October 9, 2018","vacancy tax, landlords, neighborhood improvement"
Two money mistakes that founding CEOs make,"Raising too little. And raising too much.
The typical go-go small business goes out and raises $200,000 or $400,000 in equity, usually from friends, family and amateur investors. Maybe a bit more or less.
This is a danger zone.
This is funding for your expenses and your salary and it will rarely pay off for you or for your investors. Because, it’s worth remembering, your investors want their money back, somehow, someday soon.
If your goal is to build a significant brand, the sort of consumer products company that so many entrepreneurs dream of, you’re going to need fifty times that much before you cross the chasm.
And if you’re building a direct-marketing company, something you can bootstrap, where you sell high-value products and services to businesses and consumers in a measurable way, then you ought to be making money right from the start. Sure, you might need some equipment, but in today’s Meshed world, that’s easier than ever to outsource.

Four roads we call customer service,"Road 1: I can learn from you and make things better
Road 2: You’re an important customer and I can bring empathy and care to this moment to strengthen our relationship
Road 3: I can teach you something and make things better
Road 4: Go away
Now it begins to make sense. For example, if you call Hyatt’s 800 number, they’ll tell you that they’re not actually in contact with management. That all they can do is refer you to the front desk. They’re not there to learn anything from you.
If you call a company that puts you on hold for a long time, you’re on road 4. The organization has decided that you are a cost, not an asset.
Road 1 customer service is pretty rare. It tends to happen with very small organizations, and that’s one reason why companies appear callous and stuck when they get bigger. They don’t want to spend the resources to expose their decision-makers and creators to the people who actually use the product or service, so they build a moat around them. All they seek to learn is, “how cheap can we mollify customers?”
Road 2 and Road 3 can overlap. It’s entirely possible that the customer is upset or confused because they need training or insight or an explanation. By teaching them how to navigate their situation, you can improve satisfaction at the same time you rebuild a relationship.
Road 3 is often best done with the internet, with a manual, with a video. It’s a chance for the customer (who’s enrolled in getting their problem solved) to interact with a well-designed system that can teach them how to solve it. This can fall apart when the customer doesn’t actually want to learn, or worse, when the organization does a mediocre job of education.
Sometimes, though, the flight actuallyiscancelled, the software has a bug or the weather just isn’t what it needs to be. In that moment, education can help, but what matters more is clarity, respect and care. Most customers don’t actually expect miracles, but they certainly expect more than Road 4.
The harried commodity providers, the pawns in a monopolistic system that have chosen to race to the bottom, the airlines, the cable companies, the underfunded government agencies–all they have to offer is Road 4.
Go away.
If they had guts, they’d just say so.
If they had talent, they’d make you go away without actually being upset.
Instead, the on-hold industrial complex has created an endless maze, designed to sort through the slightly-annoyed and only serve the remaining truly-committed to getting to the bottom of it.
What a waste.
If you engage with customers, as a freelancer or as a public company CEO, pick your road. Be clear about what it’s worth and what it costs. And then do that.
The confusion about what you’re seeking to achieve helps no one.

The red zone is for unloading…,"If you want a process to go faster, it's tempting to focus on the straightaways.
Get your delivery drivers to go faster on the highway. Get your development team to take fewer breaks during a sprint. Push for everyone to get out of the way of the moving object. Faster processors!
Actually, you'll get far more productivity if you focus on your loading and unloading instead. How many meetings does it take to get something approved for delivery or development? How many false starts are there? When work is done, does it sit for a long time before it gets used?
You don't win races based on your top speed.","October 4, 2018","productivity, loading and unloading, efficiency"
The myth of mirror magic,"Based on how much time we spend staring at the mirror, grooming our social media, tweaking our book cover… you’d think that there’s a correlation between the last few hours of tweaking and the results that we get.
There must be… after all, we spend more time worrying about the cover than we spend writing the book, more energy answering the trolls than serving our best customers, more money on concealer and blush than on healthy food.
But of course, as you read this, you realize that this isn’t true.
You can’t name someone you befriended because his eyeglass frames were just the right shape, or the last book you loved because the cover was perfectly typeset.
For surface shine, 80% might be more than enough. After that, the tweaking is for us, not those we seek to serve.","October 3, 2018","mirror magic, social media, surface shine"
Buyer beware?,"Everyone hated the traveling salesman.
That’s because he came to town, said whatever it took to make the sale, and then left.
In 1900, Sears saw a market opportunity. Their catalog had more variety, sure, but what it really offered was aguarantee. Tens of thousands of people even bought a house from the Sears catalog. They become the twentieth century’s biggest retailer because the company understood the lifetime value of trust—difficult to earn, but worth it.
The internet is going through the same schism right now.
Some folks are happy to sell you something right now, then bye, see ya (or not), because every website is in essence from out of town. With so much pressure on clickthrough rates and yield, it’s not surprising that companies are saying whatever they need to in order to close a sale. Big promises, very little care or support.
At the same time, some successful organizations have taken a completely different path. They’re so focused on maximizing the lifetime value for the customer (and themselves) that they work overtime to tell their customers the truth.It’s not for everyone and it might not be for you. Truth works because it earns trust.
Dropbox, software that I’ve recommended here before, is going through an identity crisis. They’ll need to decide if they want to invest in what it takes to be trusted. I’ve wasted many hours over the last few months trying to work my way through some significant bugs (workflow and data loss) with them, and each of the many customer service people I’ve worked with have pushed me to do more testing, and they’ve clearly stated that my problem is unique. This ‘bluff, stall and get used to it’ strategy is the sort of thing one might expect from a traveling salesman. Yesterday they finally let me know that in fact it’s a known issue, that it affects many people with hardware and software like mine, and I’m stuck with it. I can’t easily rip it out, and I can’t happily work with it either.
If they had told me 4 months ago, they would have had a chance at earning my trust as I built a workaround with them. Instead, they’ve lost a sneezer and a referrer, as well as the benefit of the doubt.

And we take on a customer who denigrates our team and our work instead of embracing the good ones…

That’s not a good enough reason. We pay for it many more times than we get paid for it.","November 30, 2018","jerks, investment, better valuation"
Three kinds of corporate mediocrity,"Uncaring mediocrity, in which employees have given up trying to make things betterFocused mediocrity, in which the organization is intentionally averageAccidental mediocrity, in which people don’t even realize that they’re not delivering excellence
Uncaring mediocrityis the most common form, and it often accompanies scale. It’s the accidental outcome that comes from trying to emulate an organization that’s focused on its mediocrity.
The mechanization and industrialization of cottage industries (like hotels, restaurants and healthcare) has led to a convenient homogenization for many. It means you can travel around the world and find better than decent accommodations and safe food, all at a fair price.
But it also means that most of the people working in these entities are treated like interchangeable cogs. They have no say at all about how things are done (or at least feel that way) and so they’ve emotionally checked out. It’s easier that way.
The products and services revert to the mean, sucking the humanity out of not just the people who work there, but from the interactions the customers have as well.
If you have a lousy meal at a real restaurant, the owner could hear from you and, it’s likely, not only fix it, but get back to you. Have a lousy experience with a Host, a Taco Bell, or a JW Marriott, though, and the odds are that the individual who reads your review has never even visited the place you’re talking about, and certainly doesn’t care enough to do anything about it.
One of the promises of the worldwide behemoth corporation was that reliability and quality was assured. The downside is that the chances that an internal insurgent can make things better go down.
As we see so many organizations seek to emulate the scale, influence and profits of the Fortune 100, it’s worth remembering that uncaring mediocrity shouldn’t be a north star.
Focused mediocrityis different. It’s intentional. It’s the act of chasing the banal, so that the largest possible number of people will be satisfied enough not to complain. This is the sieve of deliverability and the sword of mass.
The third kind of mediocrity happens when someone isuninformed. When they’re too busy or too lazy to pay attention to the taste of those they seek to serve or they don’t care enough to deliver it with quality and humanity.
At least have the guts to be mediocre on purpose.","November 29, 2018","corporate mediocrity, organizational culture, employee engagement"

90% of coaching is self-coaching,"A cherry can’t grow without the pit. The drupe works because it uses the pit as instigation, a foundation to go forward from.
The same is true for the way most of us engage with a coach. That basketball coach screaming from the sidelines? There’s no way the player can hear what he’s saying. That’s okay. The shift is happening inside.
And the coaching that happens with a good boss or inside a program like the altMBA? The theory is the same. Your preparation for an upcoming meeting, the voice in your head as you think about your choices, the knowledge that you’re accountable for your actions–all of these end up weaving into the future version of you.
It’s entirely possible to coach yourself. To develop internal habits and standards that help you ratchet forward, drip by drip. But when you find yourself alone in a “co” working space, or isolated from good leadership, or wondering about what’s next, it might just be a signal that you’re missing the 10% from the core, the seed that you can build on and then internalize.
Sooner or later, all motivation is self motivation. And the challenge and opportunity is in finding the external forces that will soon become internal ones.",,"self-coaching, internal motivation, personal development"
Is there a marketing person leading the IT team?,"Because the IT team is interacting with your customers. And they call them users. Or ignore them.
The local bank, for example, decided that adding a seventh and eighth digit to its two-factor authentication system would make it more secure (it’s a vanishingly small difference, but that’s a story for another day.) I’m sure that they didn’t consider the cost to the thousands of customers who will use it millions of times of day. Remembering 43948394 is very different than remember 439234.
Or consider this note from the TTP website:
“Please remember to revisit our website for your application status updates. Notification of when you may schedule an interview appointment (if one is needed) will only be posted here.”
Check back when? How often?
While it might be more convenient for them to forego sending out some sort of email or text alert, it’s definitely a fraught moment for the customer, the paying customer who is either going to forget, or not read this at all, or miss the appointment…

Where’s the edge?,"The world is not flat.
The easiest way to demonstrate that is with a simple question, one that challenges unexamined belief with the need to understand how things work. If it’s flat, there’s an edge. Where is it?
Once we understand how things work, we have a chance to interact with them. Not with memorization or rote or politics, but with practical effort.
First, though, we need to understand the mechanism.
If you want to take a hot shower, it pays to turn the hot tap on all the way until the water gets hot, then adjust the cold to end up with something comfortable.
That’s because the water that’s supposed to be hot, the water that’s stuck in the wall between the shower and the hot water heater, is cold. Once you flush out that leftover cold water, you’ll see the hot water arrive.
You don’t have to be a plumber to understand the system, you simply have to be curious. And willing to test to see what works.
The sun rises every morning. That doesn’t happen because the sun moves. It happens because the sun mostly stays still and the Earth rotates on its axis. No need for human sacrifice or much in the way of hope to see the sun rise again tomorrow. This used to be so controversial that it was seen as a matter of life and death. But once you understand the system, you can see that it is without controversy.
Too often, we take the lazy way out and teach our kids to memorize the status quo instead of challenging them to understand how the world works.
Too often, when the world around us changes, it’s convenient to stop looking for the edge, to blame the outcomes and fail to do the work to understand the system. We take the system for granted in every element of our lives, from our work to our morning shower.

Denying the heart,"If you want to annoy someone with back pain, tell them it might be in their head.
And if you want a medical practitioner to feel disrespected, you might try bringing up theplaceboeffect and how it’s often more effective than ‘real’ medicine.
Engineers and marketers often get stressed when we talk about emotion and dreams instead of rfps, features and benefits…
The thing is, we’re not automatons, computers making Vulcan-like decisions.
And that’s okay.
It’s better than okay. It permits us to bring heart and soul and magic to our work.
Instead of feeling disrespected because you’re seen as working with human emotions, perhaps it’s worth realizing that it’s a rare privilege, one with unlimited leverage and responsibility.

An inconvenient shopping list,"Cyber Monday (inspired by its evil cousin, Black Friday) is a symptom of our obsession with convenience. As Tim Wu has pointed out, convenience trumps privacy, morality and good judgment for too many of us–the internet has made things faster, and faster has become faster, and faster has become the point.
Here’s a list of some gifts and expressions of friendship that aren’t nearly as convenient, that involve independent sellers and crafters and that you have plenty of time for if you plan ahead…

Diagnosis,"The easy way to figure out the problem is to try the treatment. If the treatment works, you probably had the problem the treatment was there to fix.
But that’s dangerous, expensive and time consuming.
It’s a lousy way to consult, to coach or to do medicine.
Smart diagnosis leads to more commitment when the treatment is offered.
It’s more difficult, but it might be worth the effort. We look for professionals who can use effort and experience to be able to diagnose something without poking around, treating things in the dark.

PS tomorrow is the US celebration of Thanksgiving. As always, we’re delighted to shareThe Thanksgiving Reader, a free family tradition that’s been used by more than 100,000 people to date. I hope you and your family will give it a try this year.

Avoiding the curse of the low-hanging fruit,"A new organization launches and finds excited and willing customers.
These are the early adopters. The nerds. The people who knew they had a problem. These are the easy sales, the folks who will wait in line.
And then the curse can set in.
You will certainly exhaust this group. Too many competitors are seeking them, and you’re running out of places to look.
At this point, you can make the choice to move to a new town or a new submarket and begin again, finding more geeks who can’t wait for what you’ve got.
And if you can keep it up, you can do great as the ‘new one’.
But for many, this is how you die in the chasm.
Sooner or later, you’re going to run out of the early adopters. Probably sooner. Suddenly, your cost per customer goes way up. Suddenly, you’ve shifted from keeping up with demand to running on fumes.
That’s because you ran around too much. You spread the core market too thin and never did the hard work of figuring out how to change the culture, which was your goal all along.
I’ve seen this firsthand with social entrepreneurs. They bring an innovation to a village, sell it (a clean bathroom or a solar lantern or a new, better sort of seed) and then, when the easy sales are done, move on to the next village, figuring that it’ll all work out.
There are two alternatives:
The best way to move beyond the low-hanging fruit is to discipline yourself to not run to the next tree. Get a ladder instead.","November 20, 2018","Low-hanging fruit, early adopters, market growth"
Signal to noise ratio,"It’s almost impossible to have a substantive conversation at a soccer match. It’s too loud. Too much noise.
It’s exhausting to listen to some politicians speak, because there’s nothing being said. Not enough signal.
Signal to noise ratio is the measure of how much cruft we have to work through to get to the heart of the message.
The discussion to have when your message isn’t getting out is: Is the world too noisy, or is our signal too weak?
The internet is the noisiest communication medium ever developed at scale. And often, it has vanishingly small signal as well.
When you give everyone a microphone, they might surprise you by using it, even if they don’t have much to add.
One solution is to find a quiet space when you have something to say.Now(in this loud place, filled with spam) might not be as good aslater, in a setting you’ve earned, saying something you care about, to people who are listening.
Cut down your noise, improve your signal.

The digital divide is being flipped,"A generation ago, there was a real worry: privileged parents, those with time, education and money, were giving their kids access to the tools of the net while other kids were missing out on the wealth of interactions and information available online. The fear was that this gap would further magnify differences in opportunity.
Today, as digital tools get cheaper and more widespread, a new gap is appearing:
If a parent uses a tablet or a smartphone as a babysitter, it’s a lot easier to get a kid to sit still. As a result, parents who are busy, distracted or can’t afford to spend as much 1:1 time as they’d like are unknowingly encouraging their kids to become digital zombies, with a constant need for stimulation, who are being manipulated by digital overlords to click and click some more.
If a kid can’t read, it’s not clear he should be surfing the web, watching TV or playing a videogame for hours a day.
Boredom, daydreaming, a good book, building in three dimensions, interactivity with other humans–these are precious skills, skills that are being denied kids that are simply given a plate of chicken fingers and a tablet instead.","November 18, 2018","digital divide, parenting, screen time"

Two kinds of careening,"A Toyota Prius passed me at 100 miles an hour. I didn’t know a Prius could even go that fast. The driver was passing on the right, using the breakdown lane, zigging and zagging across traffic. If a car could careen, he was.
The problem with this sort of fast passage is that there’s no room for error. One mistake, one failure, and you’re out.
The other sort of rambunctious, risky forward motion is very different.
This is the work we do when we’re out on a limb with a new idea. When we’re sharing ideas that feel personal or important. This is the work of practical empathy, and most of all, of acting ‘as if’ before we’re sure.
The thing is–even though this might feel as risky as driving down the Saw Mill River Parkway at 100 miles an hour, it’s actually the safest work you can do. If you fail while trying to help, you’ll get another chance. And then another.
Unlimited chances.","November 16, 2018","careening, risk-taking, practical empathy"

And theFinancial Timespicked it one of November’s books of the month. And 800CEOREAD just long listed it as one of the best marketing books of the year…
Lots of cool surprises in this post, just for you and my other favorite blog readers…
For the first time, we’re hosting anonline launch party. If you grab a copy in the next two weeks, we’d love to have you join us.
The launch party will feature exclusive videos from me expanding on ideas in the book, an ongoing Q&A session and most of all, a chance to connect with thousands of other alumni of our onlineseminarand the purchasers of the book as well. You’ll find a cohort of fascinating and generous people there, and my hope is that if you’re an eager contributor to the party, you’ll find that it’s even worth more than the cost of the book itself.
If you’re an early adopter, the kind of person who goes first, you’re our kind of person. Join the launch party to meet more people like us. If you get a copy in the next week or so, you can join in. Sign uphere.
The launch party is free to join for readers. Once you buy a copy of the book, you’ll find a code on the bottom of page 260 (or in the Kindle edition, at the end of the acknowledgments) that will get you into the Party. If you’re listening on audio, use the link at the bottom of thepage.

And the new one is fun indeed:
Find out more about the collectible here. [ALL GONE, SORRY]
There are only 2,000 of them in the warehouse, and we’re not going to make any more. I hope you’ll check it out before they’re all gone. There are 19 different covers packed in four different sets of 8… see if you can collect them all.
And what will you do with those 7 extra books, the ones that come with a limited-edition custom cover?
I’m hoping you’ll share them.
You might share them with co-workers because you know that if you can all get on the same page, your marketing will work better and you’ll be more likely to be able to do work you’re proud of.
You could share them with non-profit leaders or political leaders, because you want their work to spread.
And perhaps you’ll share them with your students, your friends or those you admire, because now’s the best time to make a ruckus.
Person to person, horizontally.
Making the covers and the custom box and the rest of it was thrilling, and I can’t thank you enough for letting us do this work. Highlights from the book in tomorrow’s post…

The magnetic generosity of the network effect,"If you share a pizza with a large crowd, no one will be very satisfied.
But if you share an idea with a group, it creates cultural impact and becomes more valuable as it spreads, not less.
Most of the time, we adopt the scarcity model of pizza. “I don’t have that much, and if I share it with you, I won’t have any left…”
But in fact, the useful parts of our life are better characterized as, “If I share it with you, we’ll both have it.”
An idea shared is more powerful than one that’s hidden. A technology standard outperforms a proprietary one. A community is stronger than divided individuals ever could be.
When you give away your work by building the network, you’re not giving it away at all.
You’re building trust, authority and a positive cycle of better.","November 12, 2018","network effect, sharing ideas, community strength"
Simply awake,"Not groggy, not zoned out, not hyper, merely awake.
Aware of what’s around us. Present. Seeing things clearly, hearing them as if for the first time.
How often are we lucky enough to be awake?
Mass media, social networks, marketers—they rarely help us become awake. They seek clicking, buying, fearful zombies instead.
The people we seek to serve, those that we’re trying to reach–in the rare moments when they’re awake, are we wasting that tiny slice of magic? Do we create fear or boredom or ennui in the short run merely because it’s easier for us?
Seeking a state of awake seems like a worthy quest. And when we find it, it’s worth cherishing.","November 11, 2018","awareness, presence, mindfulness"

c. you have to have the guts to leave out everything that isn’t part of (b)

Most of what’s important to us, though, doesn’t show itself this way.

If what you’re doing isn’t working,"Perhaps it’s time to do something else.
Not a new job, or a new city, but perhaps a different story.
A story about possibility and sufficiency. A story about connection and trust. A story aboutforandwith, instead ofatorto.
Bootstrapping your way to a new story about the world around you is one of the most difficult things you’ll ever do. Our current story was built piecemeal, over time, the result of vivid interactions and hard-fought lessons.
But if that story isn’t getting you where you need to go, then what’s it for?
It’s entirely possible that the story we tell ourselves all day every day is true and accurate and useful, the very best representation of the world as it actually is.
It’s possible, but vanishingly unlikely.
What if we search for a useful story instead? A story that helps us cause the change we seek to make in the world, and to feel good doing it.
If you can’t solo bootstrap it, get some help to install a new story. It’s worth it.","November 8, 2018","story, possibility, change"
Understanding random testing,"There are two good reasons to do random testing.
The first is that you’re working with a homogenous or expected distribution, and the cost of letting something defective slip through is pretty low. For example, the chef doesn’t have to taste every single serving before it leaves the kitchen. Quality manufacturing is based on the efficient use of random testing to be sure that each batch is expected to be within tolerance. It works as long as the thing being tested isn’t itself widely variable. If it is, you’ll need to test every single unit.
The second is that you’re trying to send a message to alter people’s behavior. Drug testing or tax audits are examples of this. You can’t test everyone, but you make it clear that there’s a non-zero chance that someone who is outside the rules will get caught.
We do random testing all the time without realizing it. That’s probably a mistake–we should either test every unit (when the stakes are high or when outcomes are unpredictable) or we should trust our people and our systems enough to test very rarely.
It doesn’t make sense to set up a random speed trap. Either measure the speed of every car or measure the speed of none of them.
Sending a message through testing and draconian punishment might make good security theatre, but it’s a waste of time and trust.","November 7, 2018","random testing, quality control, behavior modification"
Who cares?,"On almost every issue that divides the electorate (in the US and abroad), the group that gets out the vote will win.
In most elections, the more some candidates spend, the more disillusioned the electorate becomes. The goal is to keep the opponent’s supporters from caring enough to vote.
These are not unrelated facts.
We’re being played, manipulated and pushed around. It’s important to not fall for it.
Here’s the simple math:
If you’re tempted to not vote because of the vitriol or the imperfect nature of the choices, then you’re supporting a downward cycle, in which the candidate who best suppresses voter turnout of the opponent’s backers wins.
On the other hand, if you always vote for the least-bad option, then a forward cycle will kick in, in which candidates (and their consultants and backers, who are also causing this problem) will realize that always being a little less bad than the other guy is a winning strategy. Which leads to a virtuous cycle in the right direction.
Don’t get tricked. Show up.","November 6, 2018","voter turnout, manipulation, elections"
The steering wheel and the guardrails,"Your car may have a powerful engine, but if the steering wheel is out of whack, it’s probably a mistake to simply drive faster. And putting in premium gas and removing the muffler doesn’t help much either.
And if you’re driving on a crowded road, it makes no sense to hit the gas and tell anyone who gets hit to be more careful.
We don’t have to wait for a wreck, a smashed engine, to put our tools to better use.
Capitalism is an extraordinary engine. It has remade every corner of the Earth, and done it in the course of two or three lifetimes. Together with its cousins, technology and industrialism, capitalism is an evolving system that changes whatever it touches.
But the purpose of our society isn’t to optimize capitalism. The purpose of capitalism is to allow our society to become better. A culture that opens doors for and nurtures the people we care about.
The issues of our time are education, corruption, access, infrastructure, civility and the downstream effects of the work we do.
Investing in guardrails and fixing the steering doesn’t deny the power of capitalism. It puts it to better use.

Persistence vs. consistent,"Persistence is sort of annoying.
Consistency, on the other hand, is the happy twin brother of persistence.
Consistent with your statements, consistent in the content you create, consistent in the way you chip away at the problem you’re seeking to solve.
Persistence can be selfish, but consistency is generous.
And the best thing is that you only have to make the choice to be consistent once. After that, it’s simply a matter of keeping your promise.","November 4, 2018","Persistence, Consistency, Commitment"

Quality and effort,"It seems as though the opposite of “careless” ought to be “careful.” That the best way to avoid avoidable errors is to try harder, to put more care into the work.
This means that if surgeons were more careful, there would be fewer errors. And that so many of the mistakes that mess things up would go away if people just tried harder.
And this is true. For a while. But then, it’s not effort but systems that matter.
Years ago, I created a trivia game for Prodigy. The first batch of 1,000 questions was 97% perfect. Which is fine, until you realize that this meant that 30 questions had an error. And every error ruined the experience for the user.
The second batch, we tried extra hard. Really hard. Our backs were against the wall and we couldn’t afford any errors. Our effort paid off in a 50% decrease in errors. We were down to 1.5%. Alas, that’s still 15 game breakers.
Then, I got smart and I changed the system. Instead of having trivia writers work really hard to avoid mistakes, we divided our team in half. Half the team used the encyclopedia (yes, it was a long time ago) to write the questions, and they made a photocopy of the source, along with the question, and put it in a notebook.
The other half of the team got the notebook and was charged with answering the question based on the source. They got a bonus of $20 for every question they found where their answer was more correct than the original.
The result of the new system? Zero error for the next 5,000 questions.
We need to put care into our systems. We need to build checklists and peer review and resilience into the way we express our carefulness. It seems ridiculous that a surgeon needs to write her name (with a Sharpie) on the limb that she’s about to operate on, but this simple system adjustment means that errors involving working on the wrong limb will go to zero.
In school, we harangue kids to be more careful, and spend approximately zero time teaching them to build better systems instead. We ignore checklists and processes because we’ve been taught that they’re beneath us.
Instead of reacting to an error with, “I need to be more careful,” we can respond with, “I can build a better system.”
If it matters enough to be careful, it matters enough to build a system around it.","November 1, 2018","Quality, Systems, Error Management"
Hilbert’s list,"In 1900, David Hilbert published a list of 23problemsthat he proposed would be the important ones for mathematicians to solve in the upcoming century. That list led to a focused effort that lasted a century, and the vast majority of the problems have been fully or partially solved.Ignoramus et ignorabimusis a foolish statement. We can know, and one day, we will.
Technology (the technology of connection, of devices and of knowledge) can create a surplus. The cost of light, of transport and of food has dropped by orders of magnitude in just a few lifetimes. Most of us waste electricity, water and other essentials in ways that would have been astonishing just a generation ago. Privileged populations go to the doctor for illnesses that wouldn’t even be a topic for discussion among those with less access to the surplus that we’ve created in access to healthcare.
Surely, we can build a better future with technology instead of focusing on autonomous drone delivery of a latte 9 blocks away in San Francisco.
As we enter a new year, one in which technology promises to move faster than ever, it’s worth considering what our 23 problems might be. (Hilbert left one off his list, and others have created very different lists–there’s no right answer).
A personal list is a great place to start (because, after all, you’ve solved much of what confronted you a decade ago). Technology doesn’t have to be high-tech. It can simply be the hard work of finding generous solutions to important problems, big or small.
Our next steps might be far more effective than simple resolutions, which are easily ignored or pushed aside. We can work toward dignity, toward access, toward seeing the world as it is…
As citizens, creators and consumers, each of us can also propose a more global list. To get you started, here are some that come to mind for the next decades. Feel free to publish your own list, which is likely to be better informed and more nuanced, but here you go…
[This list seems ridiculous until you realize that in the last few generations, we created vaccines, antibiotics, smartphones, GPS and the Furby].

Creating a useful spec,"If you want someone to help, you’ll do better with a spec. It lists just four things:
While there are only four steps, the specificity of each step is essential. The spec for a 787 jet, for example, leaves very little room for argument about what’s being created. On the other hand, “I’ll know it when I see it,” isn’t at all helpful.

Installing the stupid filter,"I’ve never once had a meeting at 3 am. Not once.
My iCal is apparently unaware of this. If I type “3” into the time box on my calendar, it blithely defaults to “am”.
A woman left a tip of more than $5,000 at akebab shopin Switzerland, because she typed her PIN (5650) when the little card reader was asking her for her tip instead. Of course, she had never left a tip approaching this amount before, but the device was missing a stupid filter.
“Are you sure?” is something humans ask all the time. If you go to an ethical plastic surgeon and announce, through drunken tears, that you want a new nose, new lips, new hips and a skin peel, all at once, she’ll not only ask if you’re sure, but she’ll send you home to think about it first.

Go find a ladder,"While it might be fun (or appear expedient, or brave, or heroic) to try to scale a cliff with no tools, it turns out that ladders are a more effective way to level up.
When it’s time to drive a nail, a hammer is a lot more useful than a rock. Even if you have to invest in obtaining one.
Often, we spend most of our time throwing ourselves at the wall instead of investing the time to find a useful ladder instead.
Perhaps, instead of restating our audacious goals, we can spend more time finding useful tools–insights, skills, trust, attention, access–instead.
It’s worth the search.","December 28, 2018","ladder, tools, goals"

“Nobody dabbles at dentistry”,"There are some jobs that are only done by accredited professionals.
And then there are most jobs, jobs that some people do for fun, now and then, perhaps in front of the bathroom mirror.
It’s difficult to find your footing when you’re a logo designer, a comedian or a project manager. Because these are gigs that many people think they can do, at least a little bit.
If you’re doing one of these non-dentist jobs, the best approach is to be extraordinarily good at it. So much better than an amateur that there’s really no room for discussion. You don’t have to justify yourself. Your work justifies you.
The alternative is to simply whine about the fact that everyone thinks that they can do what you do.

"“Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time”","Of course it did. We wouldn’t be in this jam if it hadn’t.
The nature of our independent choices means that sometimes we’re seduced by a decision that turns out to be a mistake.
Worth considering for next time:
Was it a failure of strategy (wrong choice) or execution (bad follow through)?
Are we thinking long-term enough?
Are shiny objects swaying our judgment?
Is it the arrogance of being sure we’re right, or the impatience of not waiting for more information?
What about the desire to go along with (or against) the crowd?
Or perhaps we’re trying to teach someone a lesson when we’re actually hurting ourselves.
Often, we’ll be in a jam because we failed to act at all. And sometimes it’s because we didn’t leave ourselves enough of an out in case of a pothole, because, as we all know, it rarely works every time.

Do we value attention properly?,"Every day, at the end of his shift, one of your employees takes three laptops out of the supply closet, takes them home and sells them on eBay, pocketing the money.
If you discovered this, would you take action?
At the very same time, another employee is busy spamming your house email list, relentlessly pitching this and that because, “hey, it’s free.”
Which one costs you more?
Consider the non-profit that hassles its volunteer list for donations. Instead of differentiating between those with energy and passion (but little money) and those with an instinct to give (but little time), they do the easy, dumb thing and treat everyone the same. It’s just an email.
Or consider the politician who turns an attention asset into dust by ever escalating the urgent pleas for money, long before it’s actually urgent.
A few simple principles:
Putting a banner across your site urgently asking for money is a senseless waste of trust and attention. It incorrectly values everyone’s attention the same. It makes the vast majority of your users (those that didn’t donate) feel guilty and less likely to engage with you productively. And most of all, it distracts you from doing the sort of work that could truly make things better.
All because we pretend that we can’t measure attention and the trust that goes with it.","December 20, 2018","attention, value, trust"
Our fundamental attribution error,"When someone else screws up, it’s because of who they are, their race, their upbringing… a glimpse into their true character.
Whenwedo something, it’s because the situation we’re in caused it to happen.
Thefundamental attribution erroris based on a glitch in the way we understand causation and statistics, and it’s fueled by our unique view of ourselves. Because I’m the only person who can hear the story in my head.
It’s obvious that gender and other easily visible traits are not completely correlated with behavior. And yet we act as if they are, writing off countless individuals instead of embracing the contribution they can offer.","December 19, 2018","attribution error, causation, bias"
The 10x lesson,"The 10x programmer, the 10x strategy expert, the 10x surgeon.
This is something we are always in search of. The human who is playing at a different level, generating work that changes everything.
The thing is: a 1x contributor can’t become a 10x merely by working ten times as hard. The physics of time won’t allow it, certainly, but it’s also because 10x doesn’t work on the same axis. It’s not about more effort. It’s about more insight.
In order to make that forward leap, you need to trust yourself. To create space. To have the discipline to say no to distractions or even to projects that put you back into the 1x mode.
The reason that there are so few 10x contributors isn’t that we lack innate talent. It’s that our systems and our self-talk seduce us into believing that repeating 1x work to exhaustion is a safer path.

"The digital swirl is real, it’s disconcerting and it’s loaded with possibility","For millions of years, we’ve evolved to live in community.
Our brains, which are hugely expensive to maintain, got bigger and bigger, primarily to support our ability to engage with others. It’s not simply a useful way to pass the time–it’s a survival tool like no other.
And so we got very good at reading body language. At detecting threats. At finding friends and avoiding strangers. We can spot a liar from across the room (or so we think) and we become despondent when we’re alone for too long.
Suddenly, though, here comes the digital swirl.
Now, instead of150people in our core circle of trusted acquaintances, we’re exposed to thousands. Now, instead of pheromones and handshakes, we’ve got to find nuance and cues from video images on a Facetime call.
It’s no wonder we’re stressed out of our minds. All the inputs and outputs have been turned upside down in the course of one generation.
And yet…
And yet, we can find a true friend in Perth. And yet, we can learn from a teacher in another country. And yet, we can see and be seen in ways we never expected.
It’s a swirl because we still haven’t figured it out. We don’t know quite how to sit in front of the camera, or read other people’s intent. We’re not sure how to prioritize the incoming. We invent motives and threats and conspiracies where there are none. We ignore the real threats because they’re gradual and come wrapped in likes and smilies. We hesitate to commit. We over-commit.
Of course we do. It’s a swirl. We’re still inventing cultural conventions and still defining rules of thumb.
And the cognitive load is enormous.
There’s a reason we get stuck in ruts. Ruts are easier. Ruts give our brain a rest.
The breakneck pace of piling up likes, seeking out the newest while watching the old (old? Yahoo is less than 25 years old!) disappear… it’s exhausting.
And thrilling.
Because doors keep opening. They open faster than the others are shutting. There is possibility around many (but not all) corners. The possibility of learning, of connection, of seeing and being seen.
We simply have to discipline ourselves enough that we don’t burn out on it all. We have to find the strength to turn it off, to use it with intent, to realize that it’s simply a tool.
The first step is to acknowledge that it’s a swirl, that it’s new, and that we’re not good at it (yet).","December 17, 2018","digital swirl, community, cognitive load"
Chronic,"The worst kind of problem is precisely the kind of problem we’re not spending time worrying about.
It’s not the cataclysmic disaster, the urgent emergency or the five-alarm fire.
No, the worst kinds of problems are chronic. They grow slowly over time and are more and more difficult to solve if we wait.
Chronic problems are most often solved by building new systems. New ways to engage with the issue over time, methods that create their own habits and their own forward motion.
Step one is to realize you have a chronic problem.

It’s peer to peer. The hierarchy is mostly gone, because the tasks can be outsourced. So all that’s left is leadership.

The late August dinner in 1979 with a dozen peers. The circle of people we reach out to and seek to engage with… These are circles worth being part of.

Every one of them is an alumni of the altMBA. Every one of them has been through the workshop–and even if they weren’t part of the same sessions, they immediately saw each other, and they understood what they’d been part of. They see the work to be done and the chance to help others level up. They show up with their whole selves simply to turn on lights for others.

“I didn’t do the reading…”,"This is a brave and generous thing to say.
If you’re not able (or committed enough) to do thereadingbefore you give your opinion, please have the guts to point that out.
“I didn’t read the proposal, but my bias is…”
We’re winging it. All of us. The world goes faster and faster, and so people are finding themselves unable to read the bill before they vote on it, listen to the entire album before they review it or keep up with the best in the field before they do their work.
That’s not always a good idea.
Winging it is a fine way to start a conversation or get back to first principles. If you’re clear about your background and your focus, you can add a lot of value without doing the reading.
But doing the reading matters. It’s the shortcut to being better at your craft. And it’s respectful to those you’re working with, the ones who cared enough to allocate the time.

Where’s your Reckless Daughter?,"Joni Mitchell was one of a kind. A sensation. A record-selling machine, with legions of fans.
And then she made Don Juan’s Reckless Daughter. A personal, idiosyncratic album that marked the final gold record of her bestselling streak.
She knew exactly what she was doing. She knew that the crowd wasn’t going to follow her, just as Dylan knew what would happen when he went electric, then gospel.
She had a choice: to make the records her fans had decided in advance that they wanted to hear, or to make the music that she was proud of.
After this, she was free.
Free to make the music she heard in her head, the music she wanted to share.
In a post-Top 40 world, the irony is clear: yourReckless Daughtermight very well be the breakthrough you need to reach your true audience and to do the work you’re most proud to do.

Topping off the tank,"As the fossil fuel era comes to an end, gas station attendants (those few that remain, as well as the unpaid pumpers who are filling their own tanks) persist in topping off the tank.
After the automatic switch senses the tank is full, they add ten or twenty cents more gas, to reach a round number.
Why?
It’s not faster. It takes time to manually do this.
It’s not more profitable. The extra ten cents on a $40 tank is hardly worth the time.
It’s not more efficient. The number of miles before the next fill-up as a result is tiny.
It’s not even easier. Most people are paying with a credit card, so rounding up does no good.
And…
It’s way more likely to damage the car (gas on the auto body) and hurt the health of the pumper (fumes).
So, why do it?
Three reasons:
It’s the third that’s the real lesson. Human beings trade enormous amounts of agency in exchange for convenience. But nottoo muchagency. Too much agency makes us feel like automatons. Even (especially) when working with cars, those symbols of freedom and control.

False limits,"You will encounter real limits. You can’t turn yourself invisible, bench press 3,000 pounds or do a heart transplant with a steak knife.
But real limits are easy to identify. We rarely have a problem discovering them.
The false limits, the ones that others put on us, those can be a real problem. Even when the limiter means well–they’re often trying to save us from heartbreak or wasted effort–those limits can become a habit, not something useful.
I got a note from a teacher at York Community College yesterday. He wrote, “Encouraging anyone to become a Linchpin is seriously bad advice for an individual to pursue and for a company to allow….think these things through before you put them out there.”
I’m frustrated and saddened on behalf of the eager students in his class. The ones who are paying out of their pocket, taking time away from work and family, doing the work, pushing themselves to level up… and encountering a teacher who doesn’t believe it’s possible for them to make a difference.
Without a doubt, an industrialist can profit mightily by building jobs that can be done by interchangeable workers at the lowest possible skill and pay. But that doesn’t mean you need to sign up to be one of those interchangeable cogs.
And, without a doubt, there’s work to be done by organizations that simply do what they did yesterday, but perhaps a bit faster or cheaper. But that doesn’t mean that this has to beyourwork.
The goal of the Linchpin is to make things better by making better things. To dance on an edge, to see what’s possible, to create and contribute, to learn and to ship.
Does it always work? Nope. Hardly. But it’s the path of possibility. And if you’re trusting someone to teach you to make things happen, it helps if they believe it’s possible. That you’re capable of bringing your best self to a problem and doing the difficult work of solving it.

Where are the Linchpin jobs?,"[We’re launching a new free project today. Read on for the details…]

Industry offered a deal to the worker:
Here’s a job. We’ll pay you as little as we can get away with while still being able to fill the job. We’ll make sure it’s easy to find people for this job, because we don’t want you to have much in the way of power or influence. We’ll use software to read the resumes, and we’ll do it in huge batches.
In return, you’ll work as little as you can get away with. That’s the only sane way to respond to the role of being a cog. If the system is going to squeeze you, no need to volunteer.
It’s hard to over-estimate the impact that this deal has had. The whole idea of mass advertising for mass jobs. The compliance-based school and resume system. The apparent power of the big companies to dictate the culture of work…
But, over time, the economy has changed. Now, the most cog-like jobs are done by machines. Now, cog-like work doesn’t create nearly as much value as truly human work. Now, if the opportunity is right, the pay is fair and the cause is a good one, it’s possible to create a culture where people choose to contribute as much as they can, not as little as they can.
This requires a shift.
Two shifts, actually.
The first shift is for the employer. It means not only paying more compensation to capture the attention and focus of the people who are willing and able to do Linchpin work, it also means investing in a culture that supports that sort of work. Compliance isn’t as important as contribution. But it’s frightening, because turnover costs more when you’re dependent on people who bring special magic to work.
The second shift is on the employee. It means caring enough to walk away from a cog job. It means being brave enough to make assertions and to lead. It means telling the truth about your background and your future. And it means keeping your end of the bargain, even when the work feels scary.
Here’s our experiment:
A weekly email newsletter with one or two jobs a week in it. That’s all.
Even if you’re not looking for a Linchpin job, you probably have peers who are. After all, that’s the sort of person you are–you know how to spread good ideas. So feel free to forward the email to people when you think it might be a good fit.
When we started working on this project, we reached out to a few possible employers to get us started. We specified that it had to be a special job for a special kind of work, and we insisted that the employer make a personal video, one that described what the job entailed.
I knew we were on to something when one said, “oh, it’s not worth the effort, we just posted the job on a job board and got five people who were good enough.”
That’s precisely the jobs we don’t want to post.
If you’re interested in checking out our first job and signing up for the newsletter,here’s the link.
We’ll never sell you anything or rent or share your information. The newsletter is sponsored by thealtMBA. Over time, we hope that our subscribers will also be our best source for the jobs we list.

All the good words are taken,"A friend is getting ready to publish a video. She worked hard on it, for months and months, and she wants it to be seen by the right people.
The traditional SEO strategy is to be sure to title it and describe it with magic words that will help her get ‘found.’ And so, words like ‘visualize’, ‘learn’ or even ‘transform’ are high on the list, because, after all, that’s what a lot of people search for. (‘LOL cats’ is high on the list as well, but irrelevant to the topic at hand).
And the same thing goes for websites. The traditional advice is to make sure that your keywords reflect what the mass of searches that might be interested in you would line up with.
So, name your plumbing company, “Emergency cheap plumbing”…
Here’s the problem:You’re not going to win that search.
You’re not even going to come in 1000th place.
For most of the magic words that nascent marketers seek to do well on, there are millions and millions of matches in the search engines. And many of the folks on top are bending more rules and working harder on this trick than you’re likely to be able to match.
The alternative?
Ownyourword.
If you search for ‘purple cow’ or ‘seth godin’ or ‘seth’s blog’ you’re way more likely to find me than if you search for something generic.
That’s intuitive. But it’s not obvious because it flies in the face of what we hope the search engines will do for us, which is to expose us to people who didn’t know we existed.
Accepting that this is unlikely opens the door to a better strategy.
After all, they’re not called ‘browsing engines.’
The hard part is showing up in the right way, in the right places, for enough time that people decide to seek you or your word out in the first place. The hard part is in doing the deliberate, slow work of earning permission, building a tiny circle, the smallest viable audience.

Are you selling to a professional or an amateur?,"A professional is going to buy from someone like you. They’re going to have a process to review the process, a method, an experienced approach to obtaining what they need. A professional isn’t going to think she can do it herself and isn’t going to make it an emergency.
An amateur, on the other hand, may or may not follow any of those principles. An amateur is comparing you to what? A miracle? To free? To something in between?
Professionals run the procurement process at Pottery Barn. Amateurs buy a new house every fifteen years. Professionals buy from other professionals. Amateurs ask friends for advice.
At scale, a large company in B2B selling has a multi-year approach to finding and working with professionals. Many talented soloists often can’t afford to work as patiently and so they often are exposed to amateurs.
It’s okay to sell to amateurs, but one should do it with open eyes.
When you don’t get the gig, it’s not because of something you did wrong at any particular meeting with an amateur… the mistake might simply be that you’re having these meetings with amateurs at all. Or that you’re going to amateur meetings expecting to be meeting with a professional.
There’s a way to optimize the sales pitch and even better, the service itself for when you are hoping to acquire an amateur on the way up, a chance to turn him into a pro. But perhaps your frustration is that you thought he was a pro in the first place…

The repetition of stories,"It’s not difficult to maintain a grey cloud and a sullen outlook. The event is long over, but the story remains.
A proven approach is to keep repeating the narrative that led us ever deeper into this memory hole. As with a missing tooth, we probe that spot, over and over, examining it from all angles, again and again, in order to keep the story fresh.
On the other hand, forgotten stories have little power.
And the same approach works for a feeling of optimism and possibility. Repeating stories (to ourselves and others) about good fortune and generosity makes those stories more powerful.

Opportunity cost is the key to making decisions. Once you know the value of the alternatives you’re giving up, you can be smarter about what you’re choosing to do.
Time is finite. We only get the next hour once, and then it’s gone forever. So choices about how we spend or invest our time come with real opportunity costs.
A car with a bumper sticker that says, “I’d rather be surfing,” tells us a lot about the driver (including the inconsistency of his or her actions). But it’s proof that each of us wrestles with opportunity costs every day.
With that in mind, the cost of watching a cat video on YouTube is real indeed.
And the internet has raised the opportunity cost of time spent.
Our access to the world of learning and online resources means that the alternatives are far more valuable than they used to be.
You’re about to spend 11 minutes perfecting an email to a customer. You could do a 90% ideal job in one minute, and the extra 10 minutes spent will increase the ‘quality’ of the email to 92%.
The alternative? Now, you could spend that ten minutes reading a chapter of an important new book. You could learn a few new functions in Javascript. You could dive deep into the underlying economics of your new project…
Or perhaps you’re about to spend an hour manually cleaning a database or tweaking some image files. You do this every day.
Today, though, you could invest an hour in learning to build a macro that will do this recurring job in just a minute a day from now on. Or you could figure out how to hire a trusted freelancer who will do the job on a regular basis for far less than it’s costing you to do it yourself.
Next week, the choices you made at the buffet won’t matter much. But if you learn a new skill, you own it forever.
Human beings don’t like thinking about opportunity costs. As they approach infinity, it’s easy to get paralyzed. As they get harder to compute, it’s difficult to focus and be mindful of the choices already made. That’s a challenge.
But worse, far worse, is to ignore them and fail to learn and connect and level up.","January 28, 2019","Opportunity cost, decision-making, alternatives"
Contractor yield,"Imagine you’ve got a set of plans for a simple one-family home. And imagine that you’re a developer with acres of land waiting to be subdivided.
You could hire four different contractors and have them build that house on four corners of your land.
Within weeks, you’d know which ones were efficient, careful and effective. You’d easily be able to measure their productivity, because they have access to the same suppliers and are building the same house.
Is there any doubt at all that the best of them would be dramatically better than the worst? It’s not hard to imagine a 3x difference between the two.
And yet, in most fields, like heart surgery, copyediting and continuing education, we fail to do this. In others, though, once we start doing it, it feels like we get carried away and can’t stop.
Just because it’s easy to measure doesn’t mean we should (and the opposite is even more true).","January 27, 2019","Contractor efficiency, productivity measurement, performance comparison"
Relentlessly lowering expectations,"We always compare performance on a relative basis. “Well, it’s better than it was yesterday…”
Toddlers, for example, seem like geniuses compared to the babies they used to be.
Some people around us have embraced a strategy of always lowering expectations so that their mediocre effort is seen as acceptable. Over time, we embrace the pretty good memo or the decent leadership moment, because it’s so much better than we feared.
And some? Some relentlessly raise expectations, establishing a standard that it’s hard to imagine exceeding. And then they do.
If you’ve been cornered into following, working with or serving someone in the first group, an intervention can be rewarding. For you and for the person trapped in this downward cycle.
Raising our expectations is a fine way to raise performance as well.","January 26, 2019","Expectations, Performance, Leadership"
Magical technologies,"Cars are many times more dangerous than airplanes. More dangerous per mile, more dangerous to bystanders, more dangerous in every way.
And yet there are very few people who say that they are afraid of being in a car. And yet we spend a fortune on the FAA and more than $8 billion a year in the US on the security theater we do before every flight. We carry life jackets on planes even though they’re needed about once every 33,000,000 flights.
That’s because flying is magic and driving is just riding a bike or a horse, but with a motor.
The challenge of the self-driving car isn’t that it’s a car with no driver. Actually, the self-driving car is an airplane with wheels.
Magical technology.
When a magic technology (one that we don’t believe we can understand) arrives and it feels like life or death, our instinct is to freak out, to make up stories, and to seek reassurance. Vaccines have had this challenge for generations. Because they’re long-lasting, involve a shot and feel like magic, we treat them totally differently than the unregulated market for placebos and patent medicines, regardless of their efficacy.
If you’re lucky enough to invent a magical technology, be prepared for a long journey.  Decades ago, I worked with Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke on two different projects. Asimov was truly embarrassed that he was afraid to fly. And Clarke was famous forsaying, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”
What he left out was, “Magical technologies that involve media-friendly disasters are the hardest ones to sell.”","January 25, 2019","Magical technology, self-driving cars, public perception"
Your customer service strategy,"Customer service isn’t simply an expensive, time-consuming obligation. It’s a strategic marketing investment if you want it to be.
When Tony built Zappos, he invested in having his customer service people spend hours on the phone with customers, rewarding them for going to great lengths to create memorable interactions. It created a billion dollar shoe store.
When Fedex was building relationships with busy businesspeople who would become the backbone of their customer base, they answered the phone on the first ring, every time.
When Apple needed to save the Mac from Windows hegemony, they installed experts at the Genius bar and encouraged them to spend the time needed to humanize a traditionally inhuman interaction.
Tesla saw that Ford and GM were working to increase the profits that their dealers would make on service. So they chose to seek to make no money at all on service, using that as a key marketing message to their luxury audience. It’s cheaper than TV ads.
Of course, the strategy doesn’t always have to be expensive.
When Google launched their search engine, they made it impossible to contact them. They set the expectation that there was zero human customer support. That expectation is a promise made (and one that’s easy to keep). It puts a lot of pressure on the product, of course, but they were up for that.
What promise does a local deli owner make? Or the freelancer who drives an hour out of her way to deliver the project on time?
A b2b insurance agency spent two million dollars ripping out voice mail from their agency. Every call gets answered by a human every time. It paid for itself in four months. That’s a strategic investment, not a cost-cutting shortcut.
Comcast and the other cable companies led the way in treating customer service as nothing but an expense, one that they work overtime to decrease. And so now, it’s not unusual to spend an hour or two trying to get help from Adobe or Apple. Fedex now takes more than two minutes (up from 2 seconds) to connect a valuable customer to a human operator. Apple, the most valuable company in the world, has shifted its customer support promise to one of denial, delay and disrespect. Was that an intentional strategic act?
The thing about strategies is that you and your team can work to maximize them. If answering on two rings is good, then answering on one ring is better. If 10 helpful salespeople are profitable, then 20 very helpful salespeople are better.
The truth about strategy in a competitive environment:If you are doing what everyone else is doing, if you are inside the band of common, then it’s not an approach that will move you forward.The only way to use customer service as a growth strategy is to be outside the accepted norms.
The question I want to ask the Silicon Valley CEOs that are caught in the uncanny valley of cutting their customer service costs while also puzzling about why consumers don’t like them is: What’s your strategy? Specifically: What’s the reason you’re treating your frontline customer service people as cheap human flotsam, protecting the folks who actually know the answer? What’s the business case for high lifetime value, high acquisition costs and a mindless disregard for customer satisfaction?
You can treat your customers like they don’t have a choice, but in the long run, customers always have a choice.","January 24, 2019","Customer Service Strategy, Strategic Investment, Customer Satisfaction"

Where would you sit?

Why is it okay to act any less professionally than that for a meeting with a co-worker, a salesperson or an entrepreneur looking for funding?

The fourth cycle of the hive mind (and what to do about it),"The first cycle of computers was good at:
This meant that if you wanted to know how strong a bridge was going to be, or how to schedule a complicated series of truck deliveries, a computer was the very best way to do it. The 1960s and 70s were transformed by these two simple tasks. We were able to send a rocket to the moon, design more efficient engines and compute weighted class rank using centralized, expensive computers.
The second cycle, though, was the dawn of the connection economy. These computers permitted us to bring distant events next to each other. This was the telephone plus the fax machine equals remote coordination.
And so you could use a credit card anywhere in the world, call an 800 number to place an order, and have your insurance updated immediately. It meant that workers and productivity were even more measured, and so were students.
Email and the internet populated large databases. It gave us Wikipedia, a web page for every business, eBay, LinkedIn and Paypal.
We used the powers of the first cycle, sure, but the second cycle addedconnection.
The third cycle combines the first two and it permits us to shift place and time.
You can watch a twenty-year old movie or participate in a video call with someone halfway around the world. Someone in Bulgaria can retouch your photos. Your phone knows where you are and who has been there before. Each cycle builds on the one before. Google maps is arithmetic plus data plus remote data entry plus location.
And the fourth cycle, which is now arriving, shifts direction from the previous two (which were about connection more than processors) and brings prediction to the table. Call it AI if you want to, but to be specific, it’s a combination of analyzing information and then predicting what we would do if we knew what the computer knew.
The prediction of the fourth cycle isn’t simply done in a centralized location, because the previous cycle put the computer everywhere. So now, we’re connecting all the computers the way we previously connected all the people. Now, we’re giving those computers the ability to make predictions based on what thousands of people before us have done.
If you’re a mediocre lawyer or doctor, your job is now in serious jeopardy. The combination of all four of these cycles means that the hive computer is going to do your job better than you can, soon.
With each cycle,the old cycles continue to increase. Better databases, better arithmetic. Better connectivity, more people submitting more data, less emphasis on where you are and more on what you’re connected to and what you’re doing.
We’d like to think that this is it, that Facebook plus Apple plus Amazon plus Google is the status quo going forward.
But just as we made a massive leap in just fifteen years, the next leap will take less than ten. Because each cycle supports the next one.
Welcome to the fourth cycle. The hive will see you now.","January 20, 2019","hive mind, cycles of computing, AI prediction"
Do you have a chocolate problem or an oxygen problem?,"Run out of chocolate, and that’s a shame. Run out of oxygen and you’re doomed.

Problems and boundaries,"All problems have solutions.
That’s what makes them problems.
The solution might involve trade-offs or expenses that you don’t want to incur. You might choose not to solve the problem. But there is a solution. Perhaps you haven’t found it yet. Perhaps you need to do more research or make some tradeoffs in what you’re hoping for.
If there is no solution, then it’s not a problem.
It’s a regrettable situation. It’s a boundary condition. It’s something you’ll need to live with.
Which might be no fun, but there’s no sense in worrying about it or spending time or money on it, because it’s not a problem.
“I want to go to the wedding, but it’s a thousand miles away.” That’s a problem. You can solve it with a plane ticket and some cancelled plans.
“I want to go to the wedding, but I’m not willing to cancel my meeting.” That’s not a problem. That’s an unavoidable conflict. If you need to violate a law of physics to get out of a situation, it’s not a problem. But you’ve already given up turning it into a problem, so it doesn’t pay to pretend it’s solvable.
Once we can walk away from unsolvable situations that pretend to be problems, we can focus our energy on the real problems in front of us.

Honorable women used to bind their feet and shame others that didn’t.
Honorable humans used to own slaves.
“Honorable” has always been measured against the current culture, not an absolute of what we’re capable of.

Asserting anthropomorphism,"We’ve been doing it for a long time.

The easiest way for a human to deal with a complex system (an AI that plays Scrabble, the traffic, the weather) is to imagine that there’s a little man inside, someone a lot like us, pulling the levers, getting annoyed, becoming frustrated, seeking retribution or offering a prize.
If that works, keep doing it.

Fads in belief,"Over time, some people embrace edge beliefs like ear candling, the Stein Harmonizer and hydrogen infused water, among thousands of others. Our search for reassurance and belief is built deep into our culture. And if it’s not hurting anyone and you can afford it, aplacebois a fine tool, and often a bargain, possibly effective as well.
It’s fascinating to note, though, that some people have embracednoneof these edge ideas, while other people are regulars,movingfrom one to the other as each loses steam (you’re unlikely to know someone who currently keeps his razor in a pyramid to keep itsharpbut it used to be common).
Why the need to switch? Why not stick with one for decades? And if you switch, what story do you tell yourself about this pattern–are you discovering that the prior ones weren’t nearly as effective as you hoped, butthisone will definitely be the one? Or is it more likely that focusing on future prospects is simply more effective and enjoyable than acknowledging the long string that came before?
[The same behaviors can be seen in some stock investors, political pundits and diet gurus as well.]

Should you say ‘please’ to an AI?,"There are two reasons we say ‘please’ and ‘thank you’.
The first is pretty obvious. It gives the other person dignity. It acknowledges their humanity. It implies that at some level, this engagement is voluntary.
But of course, none of this is true when we’re talking to Siri or Alexa.
There’s a second reason.
It helps us realize that we might be acting entitled. We forget to bring humility along. “Please” is a narrative to ourselves, one about gratitude and choice. When we start barking orders without regard for what it costs to follow those orders, it’s easy to forget that time and resources are always scarce.
Even when it’s not voluntary, it turns out we benefit when we act as if it might be.

Good intentions (how to be on time),"You probably know people who are late.Often.
They don’t want to be late. In fact, their good intentions are probably the reason that they are late. They might try one technique or another, and even apologize for being late, and yet it happens again.
There is onereasonand oneamplifying factor.
Theamplifying factoris that when they’re late, people wait for them.
You might notice that things that leave on time (commuter trains, airplanes, live TV shows etc) almost never have a crowd of people showing up five or ten minutes late cursing out the system. For those things, the things that are known to leave on time, they manage to show up. That’s because their good intentions are not welcome here.
And thereason?
The reason is that in every interaction, they want to connect a bit more, respect the other person’s ideas and contribute in that moment. They do that by spending their most precious resource on their behalf. What’s happening is that they are looking for a magical way to get more minutes in the day.
Of course, the person they’re meeting with doesn’t need five more minutes of their time. They need five more hours of their time. But it feels like giving them five minutes one doesn’t have is a way of showing them that they care.
The alternative is a simple as it is difficult: Say no.
Say it without rushing and without stress. “I’m sorry, our time is up.”
An overloaded truck isn’t a more efficient way to move gravel (or anything else). And when you overload your day by treating time as squishy based on how much you care, you’ve just become inefficient and thus disrespectful.
Lots of other things in our life aren’t squishy. Gravity, for example, or the solidity of dry wall. They are what they are.
So is time if you let it.
The hard part about being on time is standing up and moving on. But the cost of being squishy is that you’re not only disrespecting the next person, you’re stressed all the time.
Stand up and walk out.
People will learn, and they’ll end up respecting you for it, because it’s not personal. Just as it’s not personal when the train leaves on time. The alternative, which is squishiness,ispersonal. Because if you like someone, you’re willing to be even more late than usual.

Managing the leap reflex,"On my way to work, I need to make a left turn on a somewhat busy street.
If there’s no traffic, it’s easy. Stop at the stop sign, look and go.
And if there’s dense traffic, the decision is easy as well. Wait.
It’s interesting to note what happens when the traffic is intermittent, with a car every ten or twenty seconds. I’ll sit and wait, because the cars are on the edge of too close to each other. I mean, Icouldgo, but it’s a high energy zoom to make it safely, and it’s easier to wait.
But… if the intermittent traffic continues, five cars, ten cars… all the same spacing… pretty soon, I’m more inclined to go for it.
This is a dumb strategy.
I shouldn’t let the persistence of the other cars push me to make a decision. Either it’s safe or it’s not.
Or consider the kid who climbs to the edge of the pool and stands there for a minute or two or five, toe in the water, thinking, waiting, being cajoled, and then, finally, jumping in.
Either it’s a good idea to jump in or it’s not. Skip the five minutes of discomfort.
And of course, this happens all the time with investing. Which is why so many investors end up buying high and selling low…
The smart self-management technique is to leap with intention. Don’t wait for adeadline. You pay a price for that. Don’t invite peer pressure. You pay a price for that. Don’t let the traffic wear you down–you might pay a huge price for that.

Managing reputation in the age of infinity,"Amazon sells junk.
More junk every day. And they know this.
They sell junk that would never, ever be sold at a Wal-Mart store. That’s because in order to get into a store, a buyer, a human being with a reputation, has to allocate shelf space. The easiest way to lose your job as a buyer is to put brand-destroying lousy products on a valuable shelf.
Amazon, on the other hand, has infinite shelves. And no buyers. As a result, they’re relying on an algorithm that rewards low prices and high ratings. But the best way to lower prices is to make junk. And the best way to high ratings is to fake them.
There’s no cost, zero, for yet another hustler to bring yet another unknown logo and brand name to the site, to try to manipulate ratings, to sell junk. If they get caught, they can just try again. It’s a race to the bottom.
And so, the solar lanterns you might want to install on your lawn for the dark winter months are completely worthless, but you don’t discover that until after you’ve installed them. Of course, you can return them, but now you trust Amazon, the company that sold them to you, a bit less.
And so, the books on the Kindle (many of which have never been read by an editor, a publisher or a book buyer) may or may not be worth reading, at any price.
The good news is that infinite shelves lead to open doors, to fewer gatekeepers, to a chance to be found. That’s how theMartianbecame a bestseller.
The bad news is that by offloading product review from middlemen (publishers, buyers, Good Housekeeping, The Wirecutter, etc.) to the customers themselves, you transform the filtering process, wasting time, money and goodwill. It’s entirely possible that customers don’t actually want to volunteer to test the things they buy, regardless of how straightforward the return policy might be. The uncertainty that comes with not knowing if it’s what you hoped for adds cost and tension for everyone.
Of course, it’s not just Amazon. it’s the ads you see on Facebook (unvetted, unlike the ads you see on network TV). It’s the worst 5% of the hotels in any given franchise, one that’s in a hurry to get big fast. It’s the latest unregulated quack remedy that’s sure to cure your chronic disease…
And it’s going to show up everywhere that an individual or an organization thinks that scale is more important than trust.

Spindletop,"The 20th century saw the United States dominating the world as perhaps no nation ever had before. From 1900 to 2000, the US drove commerce, culture, technology, politics and dozens of other fields.
Geographic determinism had something to do with it.
In 1902, the Spindletop oil gusher became the largest source of oil in the world. And, with a few glitches in the 1970s, it meant 100 years of nearly free energy for the US. Fossil fuels were portable, flexible and inexpensive. They could not only power cars and tanks (a giant shortage for the Germans in WWII was access to oil) but be turned into plastics and fertilizer as well.
Spindletop was mostly luck. The luck of geography and a bit of effort.
The next century won’t be determined by geography.
We’re going to be paying the price for a century of cheap fossil fuels for the rest of our lifetimes, and the future is going to be driven by two things: technological advances in solar (and other renewables) as well as national attitudes and actions that lead to resilience and innovation in the face of climate change.

The essence of the rule is that once you have great power, you need to take the responsibility that goes with it.

It’s backfiring because so many walk away from their great power. They walk away because they don’t want the responsibility.

The power to lead, but follow meekly.

Successful projects and organizations require more than good intent. They require inputs from committed people who are going where you’re going. And they require a strategy that rewards not just short-term effort, but thoughtful direction and useful daily engagement.
Start with the right people. Figure out what the market needs and turn that objective into a daily practice, step by step. There’s no such thing as an overnight sustainable success.

What is marketing?,"If you need to persuade someone to take action, you’re doing marketing.
If you’re looking for votes at the city council meeting, or looking for a promotion, you’re marketing.
If you’re writing copy on your website, taking a selfie for your social media profile or trying to talk your way out of a speeding ticket, you’re marketing.
Marketing goes way beyond advertising, email pitches or the way you do pricing. In fact, most of the time, marketing has nothing at all to do with money.
We’re surrounded by people who would like a piece of our attention, a bit of our trust and some of our action. Those people are marketing to us, and it helps to know what they’re doing right (and wrong).
If someone says, “I don’t do marketing,” they probably mean, “I don’t spend money on ads.” Those are very different things.
Our culture is driven, more than ever, by marketers. The links we click on, the shows we watch, the people we vote for–they’re all marketing artifacts. If you don’t like the political situation, you’re commenting on the marketing situation.
As soon as we take responsibility for the marketing we do and the marketing that’s done to us, we have a chance to make things better (by making better things).

InstaFreude,"Two dangerous uses of social media:
The thing is, people have been talking about you behind your back your entire life. Hearing what they’re saying isn’t helpful.
And coming up with new ways to think less of others isn’t particularly useful either.
[Alert German speakers have pointed out that I’ve broken “schadenfreude” in half the wrong way, and it should be InstaSchaden but that doesn’t really roll off the tongue. Sorry for mangling it.]",,"social media, schadenfreude, negativity"
The top 5%,"In every field, extraordinary benefits go to those seen as being in the top five percent. One out of twenty.
Sure, the biggest prizes go to the once-in-a-generation superstar. But that’s largely out of reach. It turns out, though, that if you’re thoughtful and diligent, the top 5% is attainable.
The approach is to pick the right set to be part of. Not, “top 5% of all surgeons,” but perhaps, “top 5% of thoracic surgeons in Minnesota.” Be specific. Find your niche and fill it.
That’s challenging, because once you set out to be specific, you’re on the hook. The standards are more clear. No room to waffle.
Which leads to the second half of the approach: The hard work. The work of leveling up and being honest about the choices that those you seek to serve actually have. If they knew what you know, would they choose you? What would it take for you to learn enough and practice enough and invest enough to truly be one of the top 5%?
That’s something you can achieve in exchange for focus and effort. To be in the top 1% takes a combination of luck and magical talent. But to be in the top 5%, one in twenty, is mostly about choices.
The thing is, you’re not competing with the other 19 people, not really. You’re competing with yourself, competing in a journey to determine how much you care about making an impact.
Here’s to a powerful and productive year. Make a ruckus.","January 1, 2019","top 5%, niche, hard work"
Choice and obligation,"If it’s an obligation, then you don’t have a choice.
Pretending you do is simply a way to create frustration. Free yourself to simply do what you have to do.
On the other hand, if youdohave a choice (and you probably do) then it doesn’t make sense to treat it as an obligation. Own the choice.","February 28, 2019","Choice, Obligation, Freedom"
The first piece of tape,"I’m sitting on a black couch in the lobby of a nice theater. The couch is cracked and peeling, with seven strips of black gaffer’s tape holding it together. And you don’t have to be an interior geologist to see that it has developed this patina over time, bit by bit.
The question is: Who was the first person who decided to fix the couch with tape?
The third or fifth person did a natural thing–here’s a ratty couch, let’s keep it the best we can.
But the first taper?
The first taper decided that it was okay for this theater to have a taped couch. The first taper didn’t make the effort to alert the authorities, to insist on getting the couch repaired properly.
The first taper decided, “this is good enough for now.”
This is how we find ourselves on the road to decay.

Lessons for telling time,"For something as dominant as the four digits that we use to tell time, it’s disappointing that there’s no manual, and not surprising that we do it wrong so often.
I’m not talking about the big hand/little hand part of announcing what time it is. I’m focused on how we use our awareness of time to screw up our narrative about life.
Here are some examples:
We focus on the days, making short-term decisions, instead of being cognizant of the years. We ignore the benefits that short-term pain can have in earning us long-term satisfaction. Which means that we often fail to invest, embracing a shortcut instead.
We rehearse the past, obsessing about sunk costs, instead of freeing ourselves up to make new decisions based on new information.
We put a stopwatch on our best experiences, ticktocking the moments instead of living in them.
But we fail to be honest about the time when we’re in a dip, or unhappy, imagining instead that it is lasting forever.
We confuse the thrill of fast-paced media with the magic of doing work that matters, even though they each take just as long.
We might have a fancy watch, but that doesn’t mean we’re good at telling time.","February 26, 2019","time awareness, decision making, long-term satisfaction"
Five reasons you might want to start a podcast,"Today’s the best day to sign up to join Alex DiPalma and me in thePodcast Fellowship.

Experience and variation,"The only way to learn from experience is to have different experiences.
The very nature of an experiment is that there’s a chance you’re doing it wrong, or at least less ‘right’ than the way you usually do it. Which leads to the trap of no new experiences.
The only alternative is to eagerly engage with the possible.
If you follow the recipe the same way every time, you’ll get the same results every time.","February 24, 2019","Experience, Experimentation, Variation"

Telescopes and microscopes,"It pays to look at opportunity with a telescope. It’s real, but it’s distant. The telescope brings it into focus and helps you find your way there. Telescopes are easy to find if you look for them.
And it often pays to look at trouble with a microscope. Not to get intimidated by the amorphous blob that could snuff out your dreams, but instead to look at the tiny component parts, learning how it is constructed and taking away its power. Once you realize how it’s built, you can deal with it.","February 22, 2019","opportunity, trouble, perspective"
Work before passion,"“Offer me something I’m passionate about and I’ll show up with all of my energy, effort and care.”
That’s a great way to hide.
Because nothing is good enough to earn your passion before you do it. Perhaps, in concept, it’s worthy, but as soon as you closely examine the details and the pitfalls, it’s easy to decide it’s better to wait for a better offer.
What about considering the opposite?
“Offer me a chance to contribute, and I’ll work hard on it, with focus, and once I begin to make progress, I’ll become passionate about it.”
Work before passion measures our craft in terms of contribution, not in an idealized model of perfection.
Passion comes from feeling needed, from approaching mastery, from doing work that matters. [HT toTerriTrespicio.]

Too important to have a fight about,"Battle lines drawn.
Positions solidified.
Arguments made.
All thrilling, perhaps fun, but unlikely to change minds.
If your cause is important enough, it’s worth taking the time and emotional energy to make your case without an argument. The opportunity is to recast your outcome in terms of the other person’s worldview, not insist that they change what they want or what they think they know.

Skill vs planning,"If you’re a gardener, planting orange trees in Ottawa, and nothing’s growing, it’s possible to beat yourself up, burn yourself out and say, “I’m a bad gardener.”
Or,
You could realize that oranges aren’t easy to grow in Ottawa. You could either move to Cuba or plant winter wheat instead.

Who’s in the room?,"We accidentally curate who comes to the meeting, who has a seat at the table where decisions are made. We almost randomly decide who is interviewing and being interviewed, who is brainstorming, who is reviewing the work…
What if we did it with intention? What if we thought deeply about who sits across from us during the key conversations?
Convenient should not be the dominant driver of this choice. Nor should existing protocol.
“Who’s not here?” might be the most important unasked question.","February 18, 2019","Inclusion, Decision-Making, Intentionality"
The practical de-escalation of worry,"In order to maintain its power, commonanxiety(sometimes called worrying) needs your help. Constant reminders, moments of conflict and concrete examples all pitch in to keep our worry on the warpath, amplifying it and further frazzling us.
The feeling of experiencing failure in advance happens to many of us. But with active encouragement we can make itmuch worse.
Without our help, it’ll likely fade away. But if we work at it, we can keep it going for hours.
Not only do each of us experience worry, the feeling of imminent failure, but we often escalate it with our words and actions.
“Don’t you know that this is the biggest meeting of my career? How could you have forgotten to pick up the dry cleaning!”
or
“The inspector is coming, and if we fail, they shut down this franchise. I want you to redo this entire section, and work overtime doing it. In fact, call in Jim and Bob from their day off, right now.”
What’s happening here? We’re connecting the feeling of worry (it’s not really the biggest meeting of the year, it just feels that way, and the inspector has never failed us before, it just feels that way) with the real world. That gives us the ability to turn that worry into a concrete component of the actions that we’re taking. By doing so, we further reinforce the tactile and imminent nature of our feeling.
The thing that just happened is real, our action is real, therefore the anxiety must be real as well.
It takes this continuous narrative to keep the worry roaring along.
What happens if instead we say,
“Yikes. This big meeting that’s coming up has me stressed, and I was hoping my lucky jacket would be here from the cleaners. But it’s not, so I’ll need a minute to find an alternative. Either way, the meeting is going to go fine, it always does.”
or
“The inspector is coming and our perfect record is something we’re proud of. Would you spend a few minutes going over these three spots so we can know that we did our very best?”
You could make the choice to actually work to amplify your fear of the negative outcome instead of working on the real problem. But you can’t do both at the same time. Either you’re amplifying your worry or you’re working on a solution to the problem.
The alternative, a path worth seeking out, is to create apositivecycle, where each action we take creates a bit more confidence and calm, not less.
We can choose words and tones that are softer, that don’t raise our blood pressure (or the ire of the person who’s working to support us) and that more directly get us to where we’d actually like to go.
And it’s free.

Some problems are easier to sell,"In order to solve a problem, you need to sell it first. To get it on the radar, and to have people devote time, resources and behavior change to address it.
Human beings in our culture are wired to pay attention to problems that are:
Visible–right in front of our eyes, not microscopic or far away.
Non-chronic–rationalization is our specialty, and the reason we learn to rationalize is so that we don’t go insane when faced with long-term, persistent issues. We bargain them down the priority list.
Symptomatic–this is a version of ‘visible’. If the problem has symptoms, and the symptoms are painful and getting worse, you have our attention. Symptoms that are stable or getting better feel much less urgent.
Painful–some problems have symptoms that aren’t so bad. And so we ignore them.
In our control–because helplessness is a feeling most people seek to avoid. The more certain the potential solution, the more likely it is people will acknowledge that there’s a problem.
Keep us from feeling stupid–because we don’t like feeling stupid, so we’d rather ignore the problem.
Status-driven–this one might be surprising. It turns out we like to focus our attention on things that will move us up the social hierarchy.
Expensive–problems that cost us money right now are ideal for this culture, because expensive = urgent.
Solvable–see that earlier riff about rationalization and chronic problems. If a problem doesn’t seem solvable, we’re a lot less likely to stake our attention on it.
This explains why cigarette smoking among the youth took so long to (partly) extinguish. It was a high-status activity, with no real symptoms for decades. It’s not painful and the visible side effects (thanks to billions of dollars in culture-bending spending by the tobacco companies) were seen as positive by many who participated. While the anti-smoking cause was definitely helped by the weight of evidence and persistent efforts by the medical community, it was higher taxes and enforced smoking areas that turned the tide. They made the problem expensive and a little shameful. People who didn’t want to look stupid or feel poor didn’t smoke.
Other problems that have a similar set of problems: Selling pre-need funerals. Addressing climate change. Balancing the budget. Bringing your kids to be vaccinated. Getting out of personal debt. Learning science and math. River blindness somewhere else…
If you’re working to sell a problem to your public, it’s tempting indeed to point out how shockingly irrational all of the instincts above are in practice. More effective, though, is to remarket your problem with a story that resonates.","February 16, 2019","Problem-solving, visibility, urgency"
Mastering the medium,"We know what it sounds like when you’re great at AM radio, classical music or even reality TV. We can imagine the tone and content you’ll need to be really good at being on Broadway.
Jack Dorsey has made it clear that Elon Musk has mastered Twitter. He wrote, “I like how [he] uses Twitter. He’s focused on solving existential problems and sharing his thinking openly. I respect that a lot, and all the ups and downs that come with it.”
Before you decide to master a medium, it’s worth considering the ups and downs that come with it. It’s not free. It costs. Is it worth it?
Does being good at this medium help you achieve your objectives beyond simply being good at the medium?
Yes, you might attract a crowd on the Bachelor or at the local fight club. You could probably be a world-class javelin catcher as well. But to what end?
If you’re going to put so much effort into a form of media, it’s worth deciding if it helps you or only the people who run the platform.

Colors and numbers,"By the time you’re six years old, you can count to infinity. Whatever number someone says, you will know a higher one.
The same is not true for listing colors. Most of us can’t even do all 64 Crayolas, and it takes real effort to keep adding one more to the list.
That’s a form of poetry. Identifying ways to comment on beauty. Seeking creativity when there is no obvious right answer.
There’s always going to be someone who will pay you (a little) to add one more to a running total. But the non-linear act of invention and magic is far more valuable.","February 13, 2019","creativity, colors, invention"
The trap of early feedback,"We skew our thinking based on the first feedback we get. That’s the moment of maximum fragility, and so our radar is on high alert.
But the math doesn’t hold up, and this high alert can destroy our most important work.
All salt is the same. If you add a cup of salt to your soup recipe, it’s going to ruin it. Continuing to add salt in this quantity to soup is always going to ruin it in the same way, because all salt is alike.
But all people are not alike.
If you’ve created something that will delight and astound 10% of the marketplace, there’s a 90% chance that the first person who encounters your work will dislike it. He might even hate it. In fact, if you do the math, you’ll see that there’s more than a 70% chance that the first THREE people will hate it. And if you give up then, you’ve just walked away from serving the people you set out to serve.
[Consider how much more resilient you might be if the first three people loved it. You might then persist in the face of 100 critics after that, simply because the early reviews were so positive. The order of feedback doesn’t change the ratio, but it certainly feels that way.]
Listening to the right people is a gift, a chance to learn about how to do better. Listening to the wrong people, particularly the early critics, is a trap. If you’re not careful, it can become a place to hide.","February 12, 2019","early feedback, resilience, listening"

Hard work,"Consider two loading docks at small companies.
At the first, a tractor-trailer filled with heavy boxes shows up. The sole worker on the dock is tasked with unloading the trailer, asap.
He puts on his gloves and begins hauling the boxes, one at a time. He’s manhandling them off the truck and straining to stack them to the side. Eight hours later, he has a strained back, blisters and an empty truck. A day’s work, hard earned.
At the second dock, the sole worker looks at the truck and then heads next door, to the larger company and their foreman, a woman he met on the bus to work last week. “Can I borrow your hand truck and ramp for an hour?” It took guts to ask, he might have been rejected, but his calm manner and ability to connect worked.
An hour later, the truck is empty.
Who worked harder today?
For most of us, hard work is measured in insight, emotional effort, and connection. It’s been a long time since the economy fairly rewarded people based on brawn alone.
And now, consider the third company, where the person at the dock planned ahead and had everything ready as soon as the truck was scheduled to arrive…
Or consider the keyboard workers, one of whom does a repetitive task all day long, and the other who did the labor to find a plug-in or macro that would do it in a few minutes…",,"Hard work, efficiency, resourcefulness"

That’s not the question.
The question is: Is this thing you’re working on as close to perfect as it needs to be? As close to perfect as your customer demands? As close to perfect as the budget can allow?
It’s not settling to walk away from something that’s CNP. It’s simply a smart allocation of your resources.

Productive choices (which?),"When you’re doing scary creative work, or work that requires emotional labor, it’s natural to want to walk away a bit. To distract yourself. To go shave ayak, mindlessly eat or bother someone in the next cube.
This is the main activity online, actually. People avoiding the real work.
One useful practice is to have forced choices that break up the work but that are also productive. Not fun, that would be a mistake, but productive.
Example: For the next hour, we either need to be developing a brand new strategy for your widget rollout or re-filing forty 1099s. One or the other, switch when you want to. If it gets too scary on the brand side, let’s do some mindless filing.
Or perhaps it’s answering HelpScout requests. Or auditing a specific set of financials.
The key is that it be something bothimportantandunfun.

Digital peer pressure,"“You’re using it wrong.”
That’s how culture develops, of course. That’s why no one uses ALL CAPS IN THEIR EMAIL ANY MORE.
Culture develops online at the speed of light. Every interaction tool comes with peers to interact with, and quickly, those tools establish the norms of interaction.
As a result, there are a ton of rules and more arriving every day. Culture forms around us, then changes and then forms again.
Often, the peer pressure pushes people to fit in, to go along, to become a bystander.
But the digital peer pressure that pushes us to use social media a certain way can also have more positive effects. It can challenge us to understand the details in thatDolecture or to edit a Wikipedia article to make it better. Digital peer pressure can push us to level up.
Some corners of the internet are getting coarser, crueler and dumber. But others, where the social ratchet turns in the other direction, keep getting better.
The simple rule for these communities is:
If you can make things better, do so.
Independence brings freedom, but also responsibility.
Because good ideas spread faster than ever, there’s an imperative to listen and learn and then to level up. Because we can see further, there’s a responsibility to do something useful on behalf of those we are now aware of. And because we have more leverage than ever before, there’s the obligation to make big promises and then deliver on them.
It’s easy to see peer pressure as a bad thing, something that only delinquents are subject to. If we let it, though, we can use it to push us forward, to make things better.

ThealtMBAis built on the idea of positive digital peer pressure. By surrounding you with people intent on leveling up, we normalize the idea that it’s possible to create better outcomes.

Are you being manipulated?,"Pundits, politicians, hustlers, unethical marketers, hucksters and grifters seek to manipulate people every day.
Manipulation is pushing for a change that benefits the manipulator, not us. It’s often based on misinformation. Mostly, the test for manipulation is: “if you knew what they know, would you be happy to do what they’re asking?”
It might be something as simple as tricking you into clicking, or as expensive as signing away your house. It might be the daily news cycle or the relentless push to make people feel inadequate or unsafe.
Some simple questions worth asking:
1. How does this announcement/offer/news/pressure make you feel?
2. Is there something about this news that touches a hot button issue or fear? Is the story being told designed to trigger you?
3. Are you surrounded by people who are also engaged with this news? Is it becoming a mob?
4. Is the presenter of the news using external pressure to push you into acting in ways that contradict your self-interest or self-esteem?
5. How would you feel if you discovered that the story you just heard wasn’t actually true?

The business of food,"Everybody eats. Every day.
I’m thrilled to announce a new workshop, one that could change the way you work (and have an impact on the rest of us).
There are few products or services with as universal a demand, or where the side effects are so profound. Too often, there’s insufficient access to food, harmful health impacts, inefficient supply chains, and a reliance on petrochemicals–these are problems and these are opportunities as well.
This year, humans will spend more than seventrilliondollars on food. That food will do more than simply keep us alive, it will make us feel alive, change our culture and impact the planet.
The good news is that there’s more leverage than ever before. More power to more people. More chances to make a difference and to make a living doing it.
This is your chance to understand the ecosystem and to actually do something about it.
We’re inviting you to check out our new workshop.The Business of Foodis based on one of the most popular courses at the top-ranked Haas business school at UC Berkeley. And it’s taught by the bestselling author, entrepreneur and ruckus maker Will Rosenzweig.
He’s joined by colleagues from the food industry (including Danny Meyer and Alice Waters), as well as a cohort from his Berkeley course.
Here’s a conversation I had with Will a few weeks ago:

This new seminar sits alongside the others that we’re now callingThe Akimbo Workshops. More than 50,000 people have been through one of our online courses and seminars, and now we’re inviting experts to lead some new workshops we’re putting together.
The Business of Food Workshopis, like all of our workshops, a chance for you to develop your own point of view, to try out ideas surrounded by people on a similar journey. Our discussion boards are active 24 hours a day, with the typical participant posting more than 100 essays or projects over time.
Will is focused on the big picture, but he has the experience and passion to help you turn that into practical steps you can take as you seek to build something that matters.
Signups begin today, and the first session starts soon. Will’s work is game-changing and we’d like you to be a part of it.

When you’re over your head,"As you gain a reputation for doing projects that work, it’s not unusual for the stakes to go up. For projects to look and feel bigger, with more inputs, more decisions, more pitfalls.
It can be thrilling, but you can also begin to flounder.
Here are two analogies that might help you decode what’s actually going on…
It’s entirely possible that the water is quite deep. The thing is, if you’re used to swimming in water that’s six feet deep, then sixty feet of depth is actually no different. It’s not more dangerous or difficult, it simplyfeelsthat way. Giving a speech to 20,000 people isn’t twenty times more difficult than giving one to a thousand.
It’s worth reminding yourself, regularly, that the work hasn’t changed, merely your narrative about the stakes involved.
On the other hand, if you’re used to surfing 6 foot swells and you find yourself on an island in the Indonesian archipelago—where the swells are 25 feet—this is a good moment to sit on the beach for awhile.
Surfing bigger waves is not the same as surfing small waves but with more effort. It’s an entirely different interaction, and it’s not all in your head.
Take a lesson.Take five lessons.Give yourself the room to learn. Don’t jump from 6 to 25 in one day. And don’t assume that just because you’ve figured out how to survive at 25 that you’re ready for 50. Big waves are usually right next to big reefs.
Begin with the question: Is this a deep water problem or a big wave problem?
The internet is filled with deep water moments, and we can get our narrative straight and learn to thrive even when we think the water is too deep.

Getting the word out,"For some, this is the holy grail of marketing.
If only more people knew what you know.
If only they were aware of what you have to offer, of the work you can share.
Perhaps you can get more people to click on your video, read your tweet or see your Instagram.
Alas, awareness is not action.
Everyone reading this is aware that Peru is a country. But that doesn’t mean you’ve visited recently, or have plans to go soon.
Everyone reading this is aware that turnips are a root vegetable. But knowing they exist doesn’t mean you’re going to have them for dinner.
Awareness is important, but it is insufficient.
Action comes from tension, desire and fear. Action is the hard part.","February 3, 2019","awareness, action, marketing"
The honor code,"Does introducing an honor code presume that the people involved have honor, or is it designed to create a space where honor can develop?
An honor code: The simple expectation that we trust you, that you call your own fouls, that you act honorably even if you think no one is watching…
As we think about implementing this, we need to decide between, “people are so dishonorable, it makes no sense to trust them” and, “the only way to help people become more honorable is to trust them.”
A similar question: Is it foolish to build a school that relies on students to take responsibility, to learn for the sake of learning, to lead–even though we know that this isn’t what they’ve been trained to do since birth?
The chasm is, “kids only want to do the minimum, what’s on the test…” vs. “if we want students to develop a desire to actually learn, we’re going to have stop rewarding them for justwhat’s on the test.”
One more:
Should employers say, “the people who apply for jobs are distrustful and are so used to being overworked, manipulated and mistreated that we need to offer work that treats people like cogs, with tests, measurements and demerits,” or do we take a risk and trust them to lead? Perhaps the long-term approach of, “let’s treat people as we’d like to be treated, and trust them to use their best judgment” will actually change things…
And in all three cases, when it doesn’t work the first time, we have the same choice again. And again.
To trust people, to raise the bar, to insist on people finding their best selves.
Because that’s the best way to make things better.","February 2, 2019","Honor code, trust, responsibility"
Data is expensive,"The iHome alarm clock, common in hotels, shows a small PM when the time is after 12 noon.
I arrived at my hotel at 7 pm, carefully setting the alarm for 6 am the next morning.
Of course, I failed to note that the tiny ‘pm’ wasn’t showing when I set the alarm, which means when I was setting the alarm, the clock thought it was currently 7am, and the next morning, when 6 am rolled around, it thought the local time was 6 pm and didn’t bother to ring.
That’s as complicated to think through as it is to type, which is my point.
Rule 1: always set two alarms.
But the bigger takeaway is that AM/PM on a hotel clock is not only useless, it’s a problem waiting to happen. There are 2,000 clocks in this hotel. Who’s going to check them all?
The clock would do its job far better if there weren’t an AM/PM data bit.
Data isn’t free.
The microwave in my office also reports AM or PM. If you need the clock in the microwave to tell you whether it’s morning or night, you have bigger problems than a microwave can fix for you.
The metaphor is pretty clear: more data isn’t always better. In fact, in many cases, it’s a costly distraction or even a chance to get the important stuff wrong.
Here are the three principles:
First, don’t collect data unless it has a non-zero chance of changing your actions.
Second, before you seek to collect data, consider the costs of processing that data.
Third, acknowledge that data collected isn’t always accurate, and consider the costs of acting on data that’s incorrect.

Pretending to be stupid,"Intellectual horsepower is overrated.
“I’m too stupid to do that,” isn’t helpful and it’s probably not true.
We’re capable of learning Photoshop, We can figure out the arithmetic behind our analytics. We can follow a nuanced discussion of strategy. We can learn to read a balance sheet and we can get sophisticated about long-term decision making.
If we’re being honest, the real reason we don’t do this work isn’t that we’re stupid.
It’s probably that we haven’t made it a priority.
It might be that we’re afraid, that we’re lazy or that we’re underinformed.
All three are temporary conditions if we want them to be. Or we can live with them and assume that we’re stupid instead.

Bottlenecks,"Are you a bottleneck?
Sometimes it’s a good thing. It would be impossible to guzzle a Pepsi if it were served in a saucer–the bottleneck creates the path of maximum slam.
It would be difficult to water your lawn without a nozzle. The bottleneck creates pressure that allows you to reach further.
But in an organization, a bottleneck can be a real problem.
If the project is sitting on your desk, no value is being created. The opportunity, then, is to achieve your goals by getting every single thing off your desk so that it can move forward.
A team that is sitting still waiting for you to attend the approval meeting is suffering from your bottleneck. And so are the people you set out to serve.
The trick: Figure out which parts of the approval process truly benefit from your unique judgment and skills, and which parts are merely your fear at work.

It’s not your tribe,"I didn’t say this clearly enough in mybook.
While there are a few outlier organizations and individuals who ‘have’ a tribe, more often than not, we simply have the privilege to talk to a community, to connect a community and perhaps to lead them for a while.
But it’s a mistake to believe that they are ours to do with as we choose.
The tribe of people who readFast Companyin the first few years weren’tinventedby Alan and Bill. They were organized by them, introduced to each other (and new ideas) by them and challenged by them. But, as the world changed, the tribe found other places to meet those needs.
At the watercooler and at the conference, the conversations shifted. It’s impossible to stay at the center of an evolving community for very long. Even for Apple. More profit doesn’t always open the door for more connection.
The tribe of people who follow a politician are rarely aligned with her, personally. Instead, they’re aligned with each other, with the way it feels to be part of this movement. Over time, the tribe and the leader inevitably drift apart.
The tribe of people who listen to Dave and Nastassia are into food and drink. But ifCooking Issueswent away, the tribe wouldn’t disappear. When Booker and Dax produce adevicefor the tribe, that’s precisely what they’re doing. Doing itforthe tribe, nottothem. Most outsiders might wonder what it’s for, or hesitate at the price, but for those in the heart of the community, it’s a no-brainer, right here and right now.
Tribal leaders are in a hurry, a race to connect and inspire. Tribal leaders dig deep to be seen, sure, but mostly to see. To see what the group believes and fears, and to help them get to where they hope to go.
The realization that the tribe is already there, just waiting for you to contribute, is energizing. And the fact is that while we get the benefit of the doubt—that the tribe is open to hearing from you—they’re not yours.","March 26, 2019","tribe, community, leadership"

Clearing the table,"Centralized control is fabulous until it isn’t.
Centralized control gives us predictable, reliable, convenient results. Until it suffocates.
Google promises websites free attention at a time when attention is harder than ever to obtain.
It promises fast, convenient search at a time when people prize fast and convenient more than ever.
And it promises targeted clicks for a known price to anyone who is willing to pay for them at a time when marketers are figuring out how to measure in the digital domain.
But the three promises are undermined by the company’s need to keep growing in profitability.
Googlecontrolswhat gets built in many corners of the web. If your project isn’t Google-friendly, it probably won’t get built. If it used to be Google-friendly but it isn’t anymore, it will disappear.
If there are twentysearch enginesdelivering traffic to a wide variety of sites, diversity will come from that competition. But when there’s just one, then the human decisions about what gets traffic and what doesn’t (largely based on what makes Google a profit and what doesn’t) change the very nature of what we see and interact with.
This centralized control gives Google the power to absorb most of the profit of businesses that have no better option than to advertise on Google. The powerful model of their ad auction is simple: if it’s worth $100 to your organization to get a new customer, and it’s worth $100 to your competitor to get that same new customer, in an auction, you’ll eagerly bid up to $99 for that click.
Like a landlord who owns every building in town, Google can’t lose. A successful business in the online ecosystem is one that has a few dollars left over after giving the rest of it to Google or Facebook (orApple).
In the short run, the convenience and reliability of centralized control lull users into a happy compliance. It’s a miracle. It works. What’s the problem?
But in the long run, where the long tail has fewer chances to thrive and where the powerful magic of choice disappears, we stagnate.
If a centralized government authority decided what news and content we saw, filtered our incomingmailand regularly bankrupted competitors it didn’t like, there’d probably be more of an outcry.
The alternative remains the power of peer-to-peer connection. Not the centralized authority of an unknown algorithm, but the roots-based cultural shift that happens when people find the others.
When we build something that works better when it’s shared, it’s more likely to be shared.
While it’s tempting to seek to be picked by authorities and found by strangers, the more reliable path is to organize and connect those that seek to be part of a tribe, to establish better cultural norms and then persist in making promises and keeping them.
“Follow me” on this journey is more difficult, but it’s also more effective than pleading “pick me.”","March 23, 2019","Centralized control, Google, peer-to-peer connection"

Where are you headed?,"Traffic at work isn’t just a metaphor. It’s real. We get stuck. Surrounded by people who are just as stuck. It can seem like progress is at a crawl.
And then, we see a different way. Someone finds a lane we didn’t even know existed. Quickly, they’re joined by a few others, a cohort that’s making a difference and moving precisely where they want to go.
All around us, there are people who want to protect their status quo, while others are on a path to level up. Some careers are about checking boxes while others set people up to draw the boxes.
This blog, of course, is for people who want to do work that matters. It might be a more difficult route, but it’s worth it.
The work of leveling up involves pushing past perceived limitations, understanding that they’re not real.
And it involves surrounding yourself with people on a similar journey.
“What’s required here?” is the question we were taught to ask. This is the loyal employee and the reliable cog, meeting spec.
“What is the opportunity here?” is a totally different question. It’s about contribution and forward motion, not simply compliance.
For people in a hurry to learn and contribute, the range of learning options online is a boon. You can learn more, and more quickly, than ever before. The options range from straight video courses (some of which are really quite expensive, some of which are nearly free) to intensive interpersonal community interactions. Some involve fun topics and well-known celebrities, while others are dry video monologues offered in exchange for a continuing education credit.
Nearly three years ago, we started thealtMBA. Our goal was to find people who were already enrolled in the journey of leveling up and making a difference–and so we created an intensive thirty-day workshop that would help them do better work.
The altMBA is not like the other online courses you might see offered from various websites. We have a coach for every ten students, with group work, daily video calls and most of all, peer-to-peer projects. There are no gurus, no video lectures, nothing to memorize.
It’s easier to take (and make) a straight video course, but I’m not sure it can deliver the results worthy of your time.
One of the key choices we made is that we don’t have tests or a fancy accreditation. That’s because these enforcement tools separate the student from the process, turning it into something adversarial. The question, “will this be on the test?” is a question about howlittlecan I do, and about compliance.
On the other hand, if you’re enrolled, then no enforcement is necessary. If you’re enrolled in the journey, no one has to hassle you. Instead of seeking to do less,you seek to do more.
The altMBA was created to help people see more clearly, make better decisions and engage with their soft skills, the ones that truly matter. This is a cohort of people who have decided to leave their imagined limitations behind.
With thealtMBAcontinuing to thrive, we’ve taken some of what we’ve learned from the process and expanded it into a new learning paradigm, online seminars we’re calling workshops.
Unlike the altMBA, these new workshops don’t have a high coach ratio, organized learning groups or peer-to-peer projects. Instead, we’re building online communities with dozens of video lessons, lessons that each participant can turn into a chance to improve their own projects. In a typical workshop, there are hundreds of thousands of page views every few weeks, and a post is made every few minutes, 24 hours a day.
Real people, interacting with each other because the journey is worth it. Seeing in others what they know they have in themselves.
These workshops are far more tactical than the altMBA, but they still end up challenging people to ask themselves (and each other) the really hard questions.
We’re calling these theAkimbo workshops. They include The Marketing Seminar, The Podcasting Fellowship and several others. And we only offer them to people who are already headed in that direction. It’s voluntary education, it’s for people who have decided to get on the bus and get to where they’re going.
I hope you’ll check out both the altMBA and the Akimbo workshops. Because if you’re ready to level up, we’re ready for you.

The invisible limits,"Words like חמץ and kx’āhã don’t appear in English. These words, like thousands of others, include sounds that aren’t part of the normal spoken range of the language. We don’t have difficulty saying or hearing these sounds, they’re simply sounds we have rules against.
The question is: Is the alphabet we use missing those sounds because we don’t use them, or is it that we don’t use those sounds because we don’t have letters for them?

Resilience and tolerances,"Resilience is what happens when we’re able to move forward even when things don’t fit together the way we expect.
And tolerances are an engineer’s measurement of how well the parts meet spec. (The word ‘precision’ comes to mind). A 2018 Lexus is better than 1968 Camaro because every single part in the car fits together dramatically better. The tolerances are more narrow now.
One way to ensure that things work out the way you hope is to spend the time and money to ensure that every part, every form, every worker meets spec. Tighten your spec, increase precision and you’ll discover that systems become more reliable.
The other alternative is to embrace the fact that nothing is ever exactly on spec, and to build resilient systems.
You’ll probably find that while precision feels like the way forward, resilience, the ability to thrive when things go wrong, is a much safer bet.
The trap? Hoping for one, the other or both but not doing the work to make it likely. What will you do when it doesn’t work?

Embracing externalities,"The world is better because industrialism made it better.
The world is worse because industrialism made it worse.
When a factory makes something that people want, they buy it. When a competitor improves it, it gains in market share. When a third competitor becomes more efficient and lowers the price, even more is sold.
And so we have safe, clean, cheap food that can sustain us. We have antibiotics that can save a life. We have transportation systems that just a hundred years ago would have seemed like a fantasy.
The ratchet of industrialism is tied to the fast-moving cycle of the market, fulfilling needs and wants and making a profit.
That same system, though, is insulated from the damage it causes. When a factory makes a product but pollutes the river that flows by it, the factory doesn’t pay for the pollution unless required to. When a marketer seduces people with short-term delights that cause long-term health problems, the marketer doesn’t pay for it, the customer does. And when the weapons manufacturer produces ever more lethal weapons, it’s the person who stepped on the land mine who pays the price, not the person who made it or purchased it.
The opportunity is simple to describe but requires real effort to achieve: the community must enforce systems that build the external costs into the way that the industrialist does business. Faced with an incentive to decrease bycatch, waste or illness, the industrialist will do what industrialists always seek to do–make it work a little better, a little faster, a little more profitably.
Industrialism can’t solve every problem, but it can go a very long way in solving the problems that it created in the first place.
When facing a long-term, chronic challenge, we can look for a ratchet, a long-term positive cycle that helps us overcome that challenge.

Concept cars,"Every year, Audi, Ford, GM and the rest of the auto companies bring concept cars to the big shows. These swooping, modern, magical cars are in stark contrast to the cars that are actually for sale.
Why do they bother? It’s not a form of market research.
Begin with the fact that car companies need their product to be stylish. By making older cars seem ‘old’, they create social pressure to get rid of your existing car (even if it’s running fine) and keep up with the trends. And so, every year, cars are a bit different. Not in performance, really, but in the way they look and feel.
At the same time, though, consumers are really hesitant about buying a car that they’ll regret. It’s such a big purchase, it feels very different than buying a pair of purple uggs that might only be in style for a month or two.
Concept cars, then, are an assertion by the company: here’s where we think we’re going, thanks for paying attention, car nerds!Tellthe others.We’re here to entertain you, have fun. We know it’s outlandish today, but by exposing you to these features over and over for five or ten years, by the time the cars actually arrive, you’ll say “of course,” not, “what’s that?”
They’re normalizing design progress. Making it safe over time.
As you’ve probably guessed, this doesn’t only work for cars.

“We meet all Federal regulations”,"The excuse made by large corporations for the impact of what they produce is that they simply follow the rules.
Of course, at these companies, there’s often a different department in charge of lobbying to change the rules so that they can increase short-term profits while being less beneficial to customers and communities.
It would only cost the car companies a dollar per car to prevent accidental carbon monoxide poisoning, whichkillsdozens of people. When you can run the car without the key (most modern cars), it means it’s easier than ever to pull your car into the garage and accidentally leave it running, which can kill everyone in your home before morning.
When the government worked to put in a regulation requiring this fix, the car companies lobbied against it.
Why would they do that? (Now, due to outrage, they’re fixing this particularproblem. But in the past, the car companies fought seatbelts and other safety measures).
Why does any organization actively fight to lobby to lower its costs when it might benefit customers and their communities? The rules are not going to lead to lower industry sales. All the standards do is raise the bar for all the competitors. I don’t think many of us want to live in the world of Sinclair Lewis.
The restaurant industry fought a smoking ban, and the baseball bat industry fought one on aluminum bats for kids…
Sooner or later, humans are involved. And when someone says, “not on my watch,” they commit to making things better, not simply more profitable. The rules are one thing, but what if you’re better than the rules?

Perhaps you’re in a chat room, and after a few Eliza-quality backs and forths, you realize that this helpful voice isn’t actually a voice at all, it’s simply a bot, here to interface with a tech support database.
Or you’re talking to a next-generation bot on the phone, and it’s only a minute or two into the interaction that you realize you’re being fooled by an AI, not a caring human.
Wouldn’t it be more efficient (and reassuring) to know this in advance?
But we can take this further. If you’re on the phone with American Express and the person you’re talking with has no agency, no ability to change anything and no incentive to care, wouldn’t it be helpful to know thatbeforeyou had the conversation?
Or what about the publicist or direct marketer, sending you an email that purports to be personal but is in fact only personalized? Spam decorated as human interaction is still spam.
The problem with not labeling bots is that soon, we come to expect that every interaction is going to be with a bot, and we fail to invest emotional energy in the conversations we could have with actual people. I feel bad for all the actual customer service professionals (doctors, bureaucrats and others who help) who have to deal with impersonal interactions simply because their customers have been fooled one too many times.
The bots should announce, “I’m not a person, or if I am, I’m not allowed to act like one.”
Or, if there’s no room or time for that sentence, perhaps a simple *bot* at the top of the conversation. That way, we can save our human emotions for the humans who will appreciate them.","March 3, 2019","bots, AI, human interaction"
To vs reply vs bcc,"How much of your inbox activity is initiated by you? What percentage of your email threads started with an email you wrote?
And how much is spent replying to others?
And finally, how often are you bccing or being bcced?
I hope we can agree that the percentage for the third category should be close to zero.
But for the first two, the simplest way to change your day is to dramatically alter the percentage of the first two categories so that you’re adding way more value for others. In whatever way works best.",,"Email management, productivity, communication"
“I don’t like your work”,"That doesn’t mean I don’t likeyou.
The difference is critical. It’s impossible to be a productive professional if you insist on conjoining them.
Here are two useful things to consider:
If someone cares enough to dislike our work, the best response is, “thank you.”
Thank you for taking the time to consider it, thank you for caring enough to let me know…
You can choose to listen (or not) to the rest of the feedback, but all you’ll learn is how one person reacted to something you built.","March 2, 2019","feedback, professionalism, criticism"
On feeling incompetent,"At some point, grown ups get tired of the feeling that accompanies growth and learning.
We start calling that feeling, “incompetence.”
We’re not good at the new software, we resist a brainstorming session for a new way to solve a problem, we never did bother to learn to juggle…
Not because we don’t want the outcomes, but because the journey promises to be difficult. Difficult in the sense that we’ll feel incompetent.
Which accompanies all growth.
First we realize something can be done.
Then we realize we can’t do it.
And finally, we get better at it.
It’s the second step that messes with us.
If you care enough to make a difference, if you care enough to get better–you should care enough to experience incompetence again.","March 1, 2019","incompetence, growth, learning"
An anecdote and a statistical analysis walk into a bar,"The bar is dark and dingy, well-used, with a bit of danger in the air. The sort of bar that wouldn’t be out of place in a Clint Eastwood movie.
The anecdote has been through a lot. There’s the drama with his family, sure, but also the fight he had with his boss today. He needs this job, what with the payments coming due on the house, not to mention his gambling debts…
A guy walks up to the anecdote and taps him on the shoulder. A bad move at any time, but today, it’s particularly ill-advised. Putting down his beer, the anecdote turns, in a rage, about to punch the stranger in the face.
At the last moment, fist poised to strike out, the anecdote stops. This stranger–he seems somehow familiar. Could it be? Is it his long-lost brother?
The valid statistical analysis, the one that’s correct, useful but hard to believe if you haven’t been trained in statistics? He’s in the corner, being ignored.
The most effective statisticians are the ones who aren’t afraid to tell a story. Because anecdotes are the way we navigate the world.","April 30, 2019","anecdote, statistics, storytelling"
And your company will pay for it,"You might be surprised at your company’s reimbursement policy for education.
Not only can you expense that book that will change the way you do your job, but you can probably take a course on the company’s dime (and perhaps even get some time to work on it).
It’s a great deal for the company. You get paid the same, but now you’re smarter, more engaged and more skilled.
And it’s a great deal for you. Because one day, when you leave the company, you’re going to take the smarter with you.
It’s interesting to consider why so few people take advantage of this extraordinary perk.
One reason is that you might not be aware of it (but now you are).
A second reason is that learning might remind you of school, and alas, school has created bad associations for some people who were hurt by the command and control mindset of industrial education.
The biggest reason I encounter, though, is that people are afraid. Afraid to ask the boss, afraid to assert their desire to learn something and afraid that after they’ve learned it, they won’t be able to live up to the increased expectations.
Even as I type this, I hope you can see how silly this is.
Relentlessly lowering expectations can work in the short run (hello George Costanza) but it’s hardly a strategy worthy of you and your next 10,000 days at work.

The first database rule,"If you participate in a database about people or their work, the first rule is simple: it should be as simple to fix an error as it is to make one.
If you mischaracterize something, get a digit wrong, sort it wrong, include a typo, inadvertently leave something out, put someone on a list of privilege or denial… every one of these errors is expensive–to you and to the person you’ve misrepresented.
You make it worse, far worse, when you insist that the database can’t be changed.
It’s bad enough that we’ve reduced people and their work to digits. At least we can be agile in fixing our mistakes.
(And yes, I’m talking about the conceptual databases each of us carry around in our heads, not just the digital ones on our desks).","April 28, 2019","database, errors, representation"
Snooze is a trap,"There’s a button on my email program that allows me to postpone an incoming email to a future day.
Sort of like a snooze button.
The snooze button is a trap. It’s a trap because not only do you have to decide later, but you just expended time and energy to deciding to decide later.
Do it once, move on.
‘Decide once’ is a magical productivity commitment.
There is a certain class of decision that benefits from time. Decisions where more information is in fact useful.
But most of the time, we’re busy making decisions that should be made now or not at all. You end up with a ton of decision debt, a pile of unanswered, undecided, unexplored options. And you’re likely to simply walk away.
If you open an email, you’ve already made the commitment to respond and move on. Not to push it down the road.
In or out, yes or no, on to the next thing.
Snooze is not for you.","April 27, 2019","Productivity, Decision-making, Snooze"
A seat at the table,"Short-term profits are a lousy way to build a sustainable community.
There’s always a shortcut, a rule to be bent, a way to make some more money now at the expense of the people around us.
The counterbalance to selfish Ayn-Randian greed is cultural belonging.
“No,” the community says, “we’re not proud of what you did, and you’re not welcome here.”
People like us do things like this.
It’s the community’s role to establish what “things like this” are. If you want to hang out with people like us, that’s the price you have to pay. To avoid the short-term and to invest in us instead.
The community might be wrong. The path of the person making change happen is often lonely, because change is frightening. But too often, the act of taking a shortcut or finding a short-term profit is confused with the actual long-term hard work of making things better.
Fortunately, the community often knows better.

On finding something to say,"The throughline of the last twenty years of tech has been new ways to speak up and connect.
We’ve built platforms for email, video, writing, short fiction, daily updates, chat, discussion, classes…
But what if you don’t have anything to say?
It’s difficult to find a tech solution for this problem.
It might be that instead of spending more time looking for a louder platform, you could profit from digging in and doing the hard work of figuring out the change you seek to make. If you’re unable to influence one person in a face to face meeting, all the tech in the world isn’t going to help you change a million people.","April 25, 2019","communication, tech platforms, self-reflection"
The power (and risk) of charismatic ideas,"Charisma is a magical power. It enables humans to hotwire connection and build bridges long before the facts on the ground are clear.
Charisma creates rock stars, powerful scientists and con men, too.
Misused, charisma is often the road to tragedy, because it causes us to suspend disbelief and follow a leader we should have been wary of. On the other hand, charisma in the right hands is the engine that can move us toward better, toward outcomes we might have never achieved if we’d allowed ourselves to be paralyzed by the status quo.
Consider for a moment the charismatic idea. An idea, disconnected from the person who might have conceived it, that spreads from person to person. An idea that’s not only sticky, but viral as well.
I wrote aboutideavirusestwenty years ago, but didn’t talk enough there about the very nature of an idea itself. That some ideas, like some people, are more charismatic than others.
When those charismatic ideas contribute to the culture, they create a forward cycle that benefits all of us (I’ll nominate “don’t litter” as an example.) On the other hand, sticky negative ideas (like falsefearabout vaccination) persist longer than they should.
Our job as marketers is to do the hard work of finding and nurturing charismatic ideas we can be proud of.
One place to start is to look at the ideas you’re trying to spread. Consider whether they’re charismatic enough to earn the effort you’re putting into them–and if not, how to replace them with ideas that are.

Rationalizing your project,"“I followed the recipe exactly, and it failed.”
That’s how many reviews of online recipes begin. Then the poster explains that he replaced the sour cream with yogurt (it’s what he had in the fridge), that he replaced the wheat flour with rice flour (it’s gluten-free) and he used the toaster oven instead of a real oven…
Once you are deep into a project, it’s yours. It’s underway. You have heart and soul and pride invested in it.
In the face of helpful advice, it’s easy to say, “sure, that’s what I’m already doing,” and then torture your description of the current project to make it sort of, almost, sound like you’re following the suggested new approach.
But you’re not. You’re merely wasting time and effort pretending you’re embracing this new way of doing something.
What if, just for a week or even a day, you actedas if?
What if you re-did your plan, or your perceptions of the world or your approach in a totally new way, the way that respects and embraces the thing you just learned. What if you followed the recipe by following the recipe, simply to learn the technique…
After that, after you’ve seen what it can do, then go ahead and see what happens when you re-adopt the cruft that had you looking for a new recipe in the first place.
In the age of unlimited access to recipes, the hard part about getting good advice isn’t getting it. It’s following it. And then you might be able to turn the recipe into insight.

Anything you want,"Theparadox of choiceis real, and it gets worse when the choices aren’t even multiple choice.
Confronted with the unlimited selection offered by any music streaming service, people choke. They pick an old favorite, a current hit or something banal. The same is true with the nooks and crannies of Amazon or most pieces of software–when people can have anything they want, suddenly what they want isn’t much at all.
People are good at “a, b or c?”. Not as good at “pick a card, any card.” And terrible at, “think of a number between one and a trillion.”
That’s one reason why writer’s block is far more common than roll-the-dice block.
If you’re on the offering side, it’s on you to be smart about the multiple choice options that can unfold new horizons for us. Curation can do better than “Shuffle”.
And if you’re on the choosing side, you can multiply your impact simply by embracing a method that pushes you toward new (and thus uncomfortable) options.","April 22, 2019","choice, curation, creativity"
The compass and the map,"Wouldn’t it be great if we always had a map? A set of step-by-step instructions on how to get from here to there, wherever we were and wherever we wanted to go…
Steve Pressfieldrelates this magical story:
A Gurkha rifleman escaped from a Japanese prison in south Burma and walked six hundred miles alone through the jungles to freedom. The journey took him five months, but he never asked the way and he never lost the way. For one thing he could not speak Burmese and for another he regarded all Burmese as traitors. He used a map and when he reached India he showed it to the Intelligence officers, who wanted to know all about his odyssey. Marked in pencil were all the turns he had taken, all the roads and trail forks he has passed, all the rivers he had crossed. It had served him well, that map. The Intelligence officers did not find it so useful. It was a street map of London.
I love this story.
Happy endings come from an understanding of the compass, not the presence of a useful map.

“A good product at a fair price”,"Some people say that marketing doesn’t work on them. That all they want is a good product, a fair price, and they’ll be on their way.
But that’s a marketing story as well.
Who decided what ‘good’ was? And ‘fair’? Your preference for the straightforward is still a preference. Your expectations for what you need are simply yours.
It’s all a story.

The true cost of customer response,"“Your call is very important to us.”
If you hear that, it means someone is not just lying, but also isn’t good at arithmetic.
Your company spends $6 on digital ads to get a click, and one in a hundred clicks leads to an inquiry. Which means that every inquiry sitting in the queue cost you $600. Inquiries are a bit like cronuts, in that they go stale quickly. Waiting an extra day to get back to just one person probably costs you more than the entire day’s salary of a customer service salesperson.
Your company spends $2,000 a day on rent for its showroom. And you paid that rent (along with all of those ads) for a month before John walks into the store. The uninterested, undertrained, under-compensated salesperson is finishing up a personal call, John gets bored and leaves. That (non) interaction cost you $20,000.
Jon, the reservationist, is overwhelmed by incoming calls, and he’s snippy when a regular calls for a table this Saturday night. So the patron, rebuffed and feeling disrespected, goes to a different restaurant, loves it, and never returns. Let’s see–10 business dinners a year at $200 including tip and wine–you can do the math.

Dancing with infinity,"If your little bagel shop suddenly had everyone in the world waiting in line to buy a bagel, that would be stressful indeed. You’d need riot police to keep order and you’d run out of sesame seeds in no time.
On the other hand, it’s easy to hope that your YouTube video, your Facebook post or your professionally published book be seen by everyone in the entire world. Because digital scales. Because there’s apparently no useful limit. Because you believe in it and more is better.
But more isn’t always better.
Better is better.
And better might mean more specific. More respected. More exclusive. More trusted. More cherished.

Make things better,"I’ve come to realize that this is a controversial statement for some people.
Two issues, it seems:
I’ve seen that there are pockets of our culture where both of these ideas are difficult to embrace. That authority pushes us to fit in, not to seek improvement, and deniability encourages us to whine instead of doing something about it. Power enjoys passivity in others.
Power doesn’t want you to get uppity, doesn’t enjoy your dissatisfaction, doesn’t want to be on the hook to continually upgrade all of its systems. And so power has sold a cultural norm of acceptance, deniability and ennui.
And yet…
Everything in our built world–the water we drink, the food we eat, the place we live–if it’s good, it’s good because someone, a generation or two ago, decided to make it better. And if it’s not good, or not good enough, only our action is going to make it better.
We can see the world around us, and if we try, we can see it becoming better.
It might be a podcast or a political campaign, an engineering insight or a more inclusive policy. It probably involves finding and organizing others on a similar path. It definitely takes guts.
I’ll reiterate my belief that we each have a chance to assert. To announce our vision, to propose a change, to do the hard work to make things better.

Impermanence,"Beloved 1,000-year-old buildings disappear in the blink of an eye.
Celebrities we’ve never met die young. Babies are born. Music goes from cutting edge to current to oldies. Technology that was prized becomes obsolete. A medical breakthrough averts certain doom…
Our experience with time keeps changing. The concept of the time machine was only invented in the 1800s, and people who lived when they were building Notre Dame had little concept of what the world was like a thousand years before them, and no imagination at all of what the world might be like today.
We didn’t have time zones until we had clocks, and we didn’t have clocks until we invented cities…
As we’ve learned about history (not the details, simply the concept of it, that someone came before), we’ve also spent time thinking about the future. About our role in it and whether or not it will turn out the way we hope it will.
My hunch is that two things are true:
• We have much less direct control over the future than we hope, and that it will always surprise us.
• We have far more ability to make an impact than we expect. The only people who can change our culture (and thus our future) are us.
We can’t control the future, but we can bend it. And we can’t freeze the world as it is, but we can figure out how to be a part of it.

You can build a work life around deadlines. You can procrastinate, pay the late fines and push through the last minute emergencies because you need all of that in order to get to ‘have to’ mode.
Or, you can follow the path of the most productive and happy people you know. By redefining the work you’ve chosen to do as something you get to do.

“You can hire just about anyone…”,"“and you’re in luck, since I’m just about anyone.”
It’s time to start avoiding the Fiverr trap.
You can fill your day as a freelancer taking easily accessible work from clients who simply want you to meet spec.
Or you can build a career as a freelancer bygetting better clients.
Websites that offer lowest common denominator jobs for freelancers (like Fiverr, Uber, ZocDoc, Mechanical Turk etc.) are focused on the generic. They intentionally blur the identities of the people doing the work–a simple star rating, a measure of reliability, that’s all.
These are easy jobs to get. If you’re the cheapest, you’ll be busy all day.
But is being cheap and busy the point?
Because that’s a race to the bottom. And the problem is that you might win that race. You’re not generic, so why act that way?
The alternative is to be distinct. To be uniquely you. To bring a point of view to the work, one that is worth seeking out, paying for and remarking on.
It is the difference between, “what do you need me to do?” and “I can offer you this.” It is the difference between being handy and being indispensable.
Why is this so difficult? Two reasons:
The first problem is that the typical client doesn’t want that. The typical client wants cheap and reliable. And you’re not going to persuade the typical client to change his or her mind. Which means that if you’re going to do your best work, you’ll need to send the typical client to someone else.
The second problem is that it takes guts to be specific. To stand for something. To turn down mediocre work for clients that will settle for mediocre. It takes guts to have a point of view, a protocol, and a skill set. It takes guts to make a stand.
Your day is priceless. You only get it once. And then another chance tomorrow. Your career is what you invest in it, and if you spend your days building a career that consists of doing reliable work by being the lowest bidder, you’ve bought yourself a job that’s hardly rewarding or steady.
The alternative, the one you deserve, is to find better clients. Not to resent your ordinary clients, but to focus your energy and your passion earning better ones.
To become the sort of freelancer who can proudly say that you deserve it. Because your clients deserve your best work.
I hope you’ll consider joining our newworkshop. It takes guts and support to make these choices, and it helps to find the others on a similar journey.

The elegance of nothing,"What ever happened to details?
The redsoleof a Louboutin shoe, or the elegant tag on a pair of Tom’s? The sweeping fenders of a Porsche 911 or the needless complications of a fancy watch…
Today, a certain kind of customer is using a Muji notebook, or wearing a plain Everlane t-shirt. Is this what we’ve come to? One might come to the conclusion that consumers have rejected all the effort that designers and marketers have produced in a statement that rejects design. Not so fast.
Design is the new marketing. It is the product itself, not the ads or the slogan. Design is the supply chain of Patagonia, the ethics of Purple Carrot and the customer service at Union Square Cafe. It’s design, not advertising, that turned Apple into the most valuable luxury brand (and the most valuable company) in the world.
But design requires a point of view. The confidence to make an assertion. And the skill to turn that assertion into something that resonates with the person you seek to serve.
It’s probably easier to create heavily adorned mash-up than it is to produce a Field Notes notebook. Stripping away the artifice doesn’t always leave something pure. It often creates banality, the simple commodity that’s easy to buy cheaper one click away.
The elegantnothing brandsaren’t about nothing. Not all. They merely have a different, more difficult sort of artifice. The artifice of no artifice. The elegance of leading with utility as its own form of style.
And what is a brand? It’s not the logo, certainly. I have no idea what Everlane’s logo is. The brand is our shorthand for the feelings that an experience creates, the promises that a product or service brings with it.
If Nike announced that they were opening a hotel, you’d have a pretty good guess about what it would be like. But if Hyatt announced that they were going to start making shoes, you would have NO IDEA WHATSOEVER what those shoes would be like. That’s because Nike owns a brand and Hyatt simply owns real estate.
For a company that stands for few details to become a brand, then, there needs to be a promise associated with what they make and what you’ll get if you engage with it instead of buying the cheaper commodity.
In most cases where brands have been built, the brand has:
1. Served users who care about origin and elegance. They resist the idea of buying the cheaper commodity, because telling themselves they have the real one creates personal value. Beyond that, these users have the sensitivity (or taste) to be able to tell the difference between the real one and the knock off. Cayce Pollard (the fictional heroine of Gibson’sPattern Recognition) only wears an authentic MA-1 jacket (you can buy a real life version righthere). Her narrative about sensitivity, origin and authenticity makes the jacket worth the $675, even though she knows she could buy the knock off for 10% of that artificially high price.
2. Served users who care about status. The status of ‘people like us do things like this.’ These users know that their peers will recognize the invisible products they’re carrying, and this recognition is worth far more than the product itself costs. Seeing a designer with a genuineUni-ball Signo UM-151 Gel Penin her hand (from Japan) is to see someone who is better than you (perhaps). Better in the sense that she cares enough to go to the trouble. That she cares enough to know the difference. That she cared enough to pay a bit extra in time and money, because it matters–to her, and perhaps to you.
3. Found the intestinal fortitude to play a longer game. There are shortcuts everywhere, corners that can be cut, profits that can be taken. Once you get a small head start, you can license your name to others. You can cash out with a vodka or an affiliate deal of what sort or another.
The invisible brands that last, though, realize that the artifact is only an artifact. It’s not the point. It’s a souvenir of the point. The point is that people like us do things like this. Our tribe, our group. That when we see the others, we see ourselves.
Will the momentary mania among a small group who is busy measuring just how invisible they can be in their design fade away? Of course, it will. It always does. The cycle moves because the very people who drive the market, the neophiliacs, are in search of something new. Because something new gives them a new chance to tell a story, to earn status, to engage with that which is scarce.
But the brands that matter are voices that choose to matter. Voices that make assertions on behalf of their users. Who market with people, and for them, not to them or at them.
Work that matters for people who care.","April 13, 2019","Design, Branding, Elegance"
The second bowl,"I broke two bowls today.
I was emptying the dishwasher, holding both small clean bowls in one hand. One of them slipped, and I watched, aghast, as it started to fall in slow motion toward the hard kitchen floor.

Workshops are not courses,"Traditional courses, online or off, are linear. They’re based on a direct connection between the instructor’s content and the student’s attention. Write this down, memorize this, understand that.
Traditional courses scale in a particular way. They scale even better when the instructor appears on video.
Workshops are different. Workshops are about the cohort. The other students. The people you meet, the people you learn from and the people you teach. Workshops involvework, not the compliance inherent in testing and certification.
If you want to learn to build a boat, take a workshop.
It’s very difficult to run workshops at scale in the real world. The physics of interaction make it awkward. But it turns out that online, a workshop is a powerful way to learn.
A course can be quite effective. Students get a ton of actionable insights from the highly-rated video courses I offer atUdemy. But a course can’t possibly provide the magic of a workshop.
And workshops are the future of online learning.
That’s because in a workshop, you are able to connect, and connection is at the heart of the economy we live in now. Connection means finding the others. Embracing peer support, giving more than you get, engaging with ideas and with other people. Connection is part of the process of growth. Connecting with possibility, with change and with the generosity of new ideas and new approaches.
The Akimbo Workshopsaren’t courses.
In the most recent session of one of our seminars, a typical day saw students interacting with each other every three minutes, 7,000 times a day. In a typical course, that number would be zero.
We’re launching two workshops this week. One might be a good fit for you, if that’s the direction you’re headed:
The Freelancer’s Workshop(a short sprint toward finding better clients).
The Bootstrapper’s Workshop(a deeper dive into building an organization without outside funding).
Each of these is specific. They use Akimbo’s customized discussion platform to create large-scale communities built around solving a particular challenge. They are there to help you find the others.
Four times a year, we run thealtMBA, our elite flagship, a workshop that’s very different from the others. It has curated small groups, video conferencing, hands-on alumni coaches and focused cohorts that meet every day for a month.

The problem with unicorns…,"is that there aren’t any.
That’s precisely what makes them so interesting. The null set. The impossibility of it.
A unicorn is not a black swan, which is a rare bird that proves a point. A unicorn is by its very nature, impossible. That’s actually not a problem. That’s the entire point. That there’s something unavailable.
Instead of aspiring to unicorn status, a pipe dream which is simply a place to hide, we can instead decide to do something useful (and possible) instead.
It’s more challenging to set your sights on something that’s possible. More useful, too.

[HT to Michael, for a tangential unicorn riff. He points out that now that so many companies are called ‘unicorns’, the term is meaningless, a lazy trope used by some in business media who eagerly substitute lazy tropes for insightful analysis and interesting assertions.]",,"unicorns, possibility, aspiration"
Cognitive load is real,"Disneyworld is stressful.
The occasional visitor has far less fun than you might expect. That’s because without habits, every decision requires attention. And attention is exhausting.
And it’s stressful because the choices made appear to be expensive. There’s a significant opportunity cost to doingthisnotthat. You’re leaving tomorrow, what are you going to skip? What if it’s not worth the line? What are you missing?
It’s all fraught. We feel the failure of a bad choice in advance, long before we discover whether or not it was actually bad.
And it’s not just Disneyworld. It’s now the whole world.
Every minute on a website is a minute not spent doing something else. Every decision about what to write in social media is enervating. It’s not like the old days, with just three TV channels and a TV Guide to make that difficult decision even easier.
(The most popular magazine in America, for decades, was devoted to helping people figure out which one of three channels to watch).
Here’s my list, in order, of what drives behavior in the modern, privileged world:
The five are in an eternal dance, with capitalist agents regularly using behavioral economics to push us to trade one for the other. We’re never satisfied, of course, which is why our culture isn’t stable. We regularly build systems to create habits that lower the cognitive load, but then, curiosity amplified by greed and fear (plus our search for connection and desire to love) kick in and the whole cycle starts again.","April 10, 2019","Cognitive load, decision fatigue, behavioral economics"
A job without a boss,"Are you a freelancer or an entrepreneur?
It’s not simply semantics, your answer changes everything.
Freelancersget paid when they work. We’re not focused on scale… and we’re not tiny versions of real entrepreneurs. Freelancers do the work for clients who need them.
Hiring employees to scale when you’re a freelancer can be a bit of a trap, because you are likely to give up the very thing you set out to do in the first place.
Entrepreneurs, on the other hand, are organized for growth. The job of the entrepreneur isn’t to do the work, it’s to build a company that does the work. Mary Barra doesn’t make cars at GM. She organizes so that GM makes cars.
And, it turns out that there are two kinds of entrepreneurs:FundedandBootstrappers.
Funded entrepreneurs are the ones you hear about all the time. They use other people’s money to fuel their growth, and one day, they have to pay that money back, either by going public, selling, or distributing the profits.
And Bootstrappers? Bootstrappers build a business using their customers’ money. Bootstrapping is a special case, an intentional choice, the chance to serve your customers so well that they eagerly fund your growth.
I’ve been a funded entrepreneur, and I’m fortunate it worked out well.
And I’ve also been a bootstrapper, more often than not, and sometimes that’s worked as well.
Today, I’m often doing the work of a freelancer (no one writes these posts and thosebooksbut me).
Which means, if you work on your own, you’ve got three choices, and we’ve built twoAkimboworkshops that might help.
Today, we’re launching the first session of theFreelancers Workshop. It’s an intensive interactive workshop with about ten lessons… you can finish it in just a few weeks if you want to, but you don’t need to worry about falling behind. Mostly, you will meet and engage with freelancers from around the world who will help you accomplish your goals (and vice versa).
The Freelancers Workshop is focused on just one thing:Helping you get better clients.Because better clients are the only way for a freelancer to find the support and respect and income you seek.
And, also today (because I want you to make the choice!) we’re relaunching the famedBootstrapper’s Workshop.To date, thousands of people have experienced this deep dive into making deliberate choices about how to be an entrepreneur without scraping together money from investors and banks.
I’ve been talking about the freelancer/bootstrap/entrepreneur trichotomy for years. Here’s what I hear most often:
“Thank you for giving me permission to be a freelancer. It’s as though a weight was lifted, and I’m doing the best work of my career.”
and
“I’m so glad that I don’t have to obsess about valuations, bro fundraising culture and the rest of it. Our business continues to thrive, because we’re proud to be bootstrappers.”

Resources: More than 23,000 people have taken my Freelance course on Udemy. You can get itherefor 10% off.
And nearly a million people have read the Bootstrapper’s Bible. Here’s a freecopy.
The new workshops take these ideas and run with them. They connect you to others on the same path, using the proven Akimbo methods to help you go way beyond text or video and dive deep into how it works and why.

The high cost of a little bit sooner,"As the news cycle has trained us to find out results the moment they happen (or sometimes, as polling promises, before they happen), it’s easy to lose track of a simple truth:
There’s a sweet spot between knowing with certainty at a low price (yesterday’s weather report is free) and guessing with a bit of a head start at a huge price (insider trading information).
When we’re anxious, we spend too much time and thus too much money trying to hurry up what we’re about to find out anyway.

And when law firms started offering women partnerships…
And when seat belts were required in cars…
And when the building codes required fire exits and accessibility ramps…
And when work rules required more training and more rest for pilots and airline crews…
And when doctors were required to wash their hands before and after delivering a baby…

“I was wrong”,"That’s a hard sell.
It’s difficult to get someone (a client, a boss, a voter, a partner) to say those three words. Difficult to say on our own behalf, too.
Which is why we so easily get stuck.
We get stuck defending what we already decided. Because it feels easier to defend than it does to be wrong.
In 1993, in my role as founder of an internet company, I rejected the idea of the world wide web. I saw Mosaic (and then Netscape) and decided it was stupid, a dead end, a technology not worthy of our tiny company’s time.
That decision cost me a billion dollars.
Within nine months, I saw what others were seeing. I saw the power of widespread connectivity and how it was more powerful than a centralized host.
It still wasn’t easy to say, “I was wrong.”
The alternative is, “based on new information, I can make a new decision.”
We can make a new decision on what’s happening to our environment, based on new data and new science. We can make a new decision on corporate governance or on a recent political referendum.
“Why didn’t you tell me that it would lead to all these bad outcomes?”
Not wrong, simply underinformed.
The cost of a do-over is often less than the cost of sticking with a decision that was made in good faith, on insufficient information.

The avocado principles,"All of these truths lead to the real insight, the metaphor that’s just waiting to be lived in all ways: If you get ahead of the cycle, waiting until the first one is ripe and then always replenishing before you need one, you can live an entire life eating ripe avocados.

More right,"There are at least seven realistic ways to get from my home near New York to a meeting in Washington DC. None of them are wrong. Each offers its own advantage in terms of resilience, speed, cost or hassle.
And so, we can’t choose based on this is right and those are wrong. The only useful construct is to consider our priorities and find the route with the best combination of trade offs.

Next to the competition,"Books sell better in bookstores than they sell in butcher shops. In a bookstore, surrounded by all the competition, a book is in the right place to be seen, compared and ultimately purchased and read.
Trade show booths work when they’re in close proximity to the other options a buyer has. Building your trade show booth across town might insulate you from the other choices, but it does little to help establish where you belong and whether or not you’re a smart choice.
If I was one of the 25 people running for President of the US, I’d organize my own debate tour. I’d invite four or five other candidates to hit the road with me, and I’d do a debate every single night. All six of us would benefit from the competition, leaving the rest behind, ignored because they are alone. No one will stop you, simply begin.
And if I was a wedding photographer, I’d organize a dozen other photographers in town and do a joint brochure and marketing effort. Serving brides in a way that establishes status and increases their confidence.
It’s tempting indeed to shy away from organizing a panel, a conference or a trade show where you can see and be seen right next to those that seek to solve problems for those that are listening. But now that information flows more freely than ever, that’s your fear talking, not an actual strategy for somehow fooling people into believing they don’t have a choice.

This has gone too far,"The press release from Comcast, perhaps America’s most hated monopoly, begins as expected. “In order to serve all of our customers better, we’re delighted to announce several new features…”
But it goes quickly downhill from there. Under the guise of increasing net access during a time when Net Neutrality is sorely missed, spokesperson Kevin Marting says, “We’ll be offering a new basic plan, one that costs 15% less than our current offerings. The only difference in service is that due to the cost of moving text around, these users won’t get vowels in their emails or blog posts.”
He goes on to point out that reading without vowels is an ancient tradition, back to the Sumerians and ancient Hebrew. And that it’s more convenient, because, after all, convenience is what we all care about.
I was part of the team that developed theoriginal codecfor the internet, particularly the way aascii characters would be treated. Because there are 26 letters (more in various international alphabets) we had to divide the corpus of letters into two batches, reserving a high bit for some of the most used letters. Thishigh bitis necessary, but it also requires twice as much bandwidth to transfer.
Of course, the videos transmitted by Netflix and YouTube use far more space than any text file ever would, but Comcast, seeing the post-literate future, decided to take a short-term selfish route and eliminate the letters that are the most difficult to move around.
This is about the relentless munching around the edges that big companies engage in. They need to boost their earnings, and instead of focusing on better, they obsess aboutmore.
Once again, ordinary people are seeing choice stripped away by selfish functionaries and power-hungry bureaucrats.
In the case of this blog, because we’re connected to the net via Comcast’s DSL (the only service that’s available in my building) it means that after next week, all future posts on the blog will only contain consonants (and semicolons).
Enough already.
The internet works because it’s open. It creates generous connection across time and distance, and it works best when it’s accessible to all.
Just because a company can legally do something doesn’t mean that they should.

Cognitive load and the convenience problem,"Why do smart people trade away so much money and freedom for just a little convenience?
We do it all the time. We take the easy path, the simple shortcut or the long-term bad deal simply because it feels easier.
The reason? Thinking is not worth the hassle.
Cognitive load overwhelms us. Too many choices. The stakes feel too high. Every day, we make 1,000 times as many different decisions as our cavemen ancestors did. We’re exhausted from all the decisions, and more than that, from the narrative we have about making them poorly.
Over the years, marketers have offered us one wonder or another in exchange for just a little cognitive load. And those promises have often been empty. Not worth the hassle.
So now, we’ll press the re-order button like a pigeon in a lab. It’s easier.

On winning,"Most people try to win.
The real question is, “at what?”
If you focus your sights on winning the local bowling league, the effort can consume you, and you will be aware of your progress and your competition.
Or, if you turn the poetry you’re writing into your game, with the goal of winning that next stanza–not in the eyes of a publisher, an editor or a reader, but in your eyes–you can turn that into your thing.
If, instead, your goal is to raise more money at a higher valuation in the Valley, then that’s the game you’ve chosen.
Or, perhaps, your game is to bend others to your will, to prey on yet another human you see as weaker than you are…
Often, we choose games we can’t possibly win. That approach might be working for you, as it lets you off the hook because you won’t have to work out what to do if you win.
And sometimes, we choose games where we can’t win unless someone else loses. And these games can often have long-term, toxic after-effects.
As you can see, modifying a game you’re already playing because you don’t like how it’s turning out isn’t nearly as useful as picking the right game in the first place.","May 30, 2019","winning, games, goals"
Justifying mediocre work,"The list of reasons is nearly endless.
We need all of them to explain the shortcuts, phone-ins and half-work that we’re surrounded by.
All of them are pretty good reasons too. We’re in a hurry, the system is unfair, the market demands it, no one will notice, it’s not my job, I was handed a lousy spec, the materials are second-rate, the market won’t pay for quality, competition is cutthroat, my boss is a jerk, it’s actually pretty good, no one appreciates the good stuff anyway…
On the other hand, there’s only one way to justify work that’s better than it needs to be: Because you cared enough.","May 29, 2019","mediocre work, justification, dedication"
The timing of side effects,"Loosen the constraints on a system and the system will almost always do better in the short run.
That’s if we definebetteras the visible outputs of what the system does. Andshort runas, “the stuff that happens before we have to live with the side effects.”
So… if you remove environmental regulation from a factory, it will probably make more stuff faster. For awhile. But then the river is sludge and the workers are dead, so in the long run, not so much.
If you stop paying taxes, you’ll have more money today. But the civilization you depend on to enjoy that money will soon disappear.
If you stop taking medicine because you don’t like the stomach ache it gives you, you’ll definitely have a better day today. Until you stop having a better day, because of the illness that comes back because you stopped taking your medicine.
All side effects are more simply called “effects.” And getting clear about the time frame we live in is the first step to leaving things better than we found them.","May 28, 2019","side effects, short run, long run"
Accountability vs. responsibility,"Accountability is done to you. It’s done by the industrial system, by those that want to create blame.

The crime is simply a shortcut.
The same is true for people on Wall Street. The money is simply a means to keep score of theorganizedpart.
When people are willing to sacrifice their principles to take shortcuts, when they’re willing to bully or cheat or lie to get more status, we are understandably disdainful. Because the boundaries matter. Because we can see that once someone is willing to cheat a little to win, they’re probably willing to cheat a lot.","May 26, 2019","organized crime, power dynamics, moral shortcuts"
On finishing well,"If you start a book, you will do better if you have a plan for finishing your book.
If you take the time and spend the money to go to college, it’s worth considering graduating as well.
Aretha Franklin died without a clearly stated will. As a result, her heirs will waste time, money and frustration, because Franklin was both naive (a will doesn’t make it more likely that you will die) and selfish.
If you’re born, it pays to plan on dying.
Every year, millions of people needlessly suffer in old age because they didn’t spend twenty minutes on ahealth care proxy.
If you’re going to take a job, everyone will benefit if you think about how you’re going to leave that job.
And if you start a company, you should realize that you’re probably going to either sell it or fold it one day, and neither has to be a catastrophe or a failure.
Beginning is magical. So is finishing. We can embrace both.","May 25, 2019","planning, completion, legacy"
Defective apologies,"Civilization depends on the apology. When humans interact and something goes wrong, the apology builds a bridge that enables us to move forward.
But apologies are failing more often. Two reasons: First, organizations aren’t humans, and organizations often seek to avoid or industrialize the human work that civilization needs. And secondly, the apology is a complex organism, one with many structures and purposes, and our culture models (or fails to model) how it’s supposed to be done.
Consider that we can say, “I’m sorry” at a funeral even if we didn’t murder the deceased, but we also say, “I’m sorry” when we bump into someone in a crowded train station and “I’m sorry” when we get caught shoplifting. Three different situations, with fundamentally different amounts of complicity, blame or guilt.
When someone accidentally bumps into us, we don’t expect compensation or punishment, but we very much want to be acknowledged. On the other hand, acknowledgment is insufficient when someone sought to profit from our pain.
We can start by asking, “what is this apology for?” What does the person need from us?
The first category is the one that most demands humanity, and it’s also the most common. A form letter from a company does not make us feel seen. Neither does an automated text from an airline when a plane is late. One reason that malpractice victims sue is that surgeons sometimes have trouble with a genuine apology. This non-human behavior is getting worse and is being celebrated in parts of our culture (mistaking it for strength), which leads to a demand for the other three.
Compensationis the ancient tradition of seeking to make a victim whole. Unless the injury is solely financial, financial compensation is insufficient, but that doesn’t mean we haven’t tried to build systems that use money to atone for ills.
Punishmentis different from compensation. Punishment allows the victim to feel seen, because he or she is now aware that the transgressor feels some pain as well. (Punishment is unsatisfying to the victim if he or she is unaware of it). Punishment is economically suspect, though, because other than the second-order feeling of being seen, the punishment doesn’t directly help the person who was injured. It also can spiral forward, leading to ever more damage.
And finally,stopping the damage, which often co-exists with the other three needs. This is the affirmative act of making sure it doesn’t happen again. This is correcting the website so that the next person who reads it won’t see the same error. This is fixing the railing so the next visitor won’t trip and fall. This is the organization investing time and energy to actually improve its systems.
Compounding these totally different sorts of apologies is the very industrial idea of winning. Victims have been sold that it’s not enough that your compensation is merely helpful, but it has to be themost. That you won the biggest judgment in history. That the transgressor isn’t simply going to jail, but is going to jail forever, far away, in solitary confinement. We’ve all ended up in a place where one of the ways to feel seen is to also feel like you came in first place compared to others.
There’s an old cartoon–an irate customer is standing at the complaints desk of a store, clearly not mollified by the clerk. She then asks, exasperated, “well, what if we shut down the store, burn it to the ground and run the owner out of town… will that be enough?”
The challenge that organizations have is that they haven’t trained, rewarded or permitted their frontline employees to exert emotional labor to create human connection when it’s most needed.
The traveler goes straight from, “my flight is overbooked,” to “I want a million frequent flyer miles and a first class ticket on the next flight.”
The patient goes from, “the scar on my leg isn’t healing,” to “I’m going to sue you.”
And the most common unseen situation is the customer who walks away, forever, because you have a broken system and you’re not hearing from your people about how to fix it.
Organizations that refuse to see the pain they’re causing because they’re afraid of being held responsible have missed the point. You’realreadybeing held responsible. The question is what to do about it? You can stonewall, bureaucratize and delay, and hope that the system will suffice…
The alternative is to choose to contribute to connection by actually apologizing. Apologizing not to make the person go away, but because they have feelings, and you can do something for them. Apologizing with time and direct contact, and following it up by actually changing the defective systems that caused the problem.
“Yikes, I’m sorry you missed your flight–I really wish that hadn’t happened. The next flight is in an hour, but that’s probably going to ruin your entire trip. Are you headed on vacation?”
“You’re right, you booked a front-facing seat, but you got one that’s facing backward–and I hear you about getting motion sickness, my sister does too… I know that Amtrak has been having trouble with our systems, but I have the hotline number of the head of ops–I’m going to call and let them know.”
“Yeah, I shouldn’t have written that review. I was in a bad mood when I wrote it. I apologize. But, to set the record straight, I’m going to delete that review and write a new one, just as loud, but this time telling people about how much you care.”
Consider that an effective apology has a few elements to it:1. You know what sort of apology you’re offering.2. You share your story with the aggrieved as well as hearing their story, thus becoming human, and then taking the time to help them feel seen by you.3. You engage with the person who was harmed and find out, beyond being seen, what would help them move forward, noting that it’s impossible to make complete amends.
[It’s worth noting that these are not the same steps you’d take if you’re simply hoping the person will shut up and go away, without you seeing them. That’s not going to happen, and acting as if it will, will only make your problem worse.]

For 500 years, this hasn’t been true for books.And now it’s not true for anything.

Three kinds of ‘forever’,"There’s the forever of discomfort.Sasha Dichtertaughtus about this. The feeling we get during a temporary situation that feels like it’s going to last forever.
It’s one thing to tolerate a bumpy landing on an airplane, because you know it’ll be over in ten seconds.
But, a car-sick toddler doesn’t have that perspective. He’s wailing and sad because he thinks that this is the new normal, a permanent situation.
Too often, we quit in the dip. Not because we can’t tolerate discomfort for an hour, a week or a month, but because we mistakenly believe that it might last forever.
There’s the forever of plenty.This is when we erroneously assume that the stuff that’s good is going to stay good. That this moment, this leverage, these resources–we can squander them because they’ll be here tomorrow.
This sort of forever leads to heartbreak, because, inevitably, it doesn’t last. It can’t.
And there’s the forever of never.The dominant narrative of society is that you’re stuck with what you’ve got. Stuck in your status role, stuck in your skill set, stuck in your situation.
If you believe it, it’s probably true.
If you believe it, you just let yourself off the hook, which is comforting indeed.
And if you believe it, you’ve made life easier for the systems that would like to pigeonhole you.
But, even though it’s certainly harder than it ought to be, it doesn’t have to be forever.

Kinds of truth,"“Gravity’s not just a good idea, it’s the law.”
A truth is a useful, reliable statement of how the world is. You can ignore it, but it will cost you, because the world won’t work the way you hope it will. You can dislike the truth, but pretending it isn’t true isn’t an effective way to accomplish your goals or to further our culture.
Most of the kinds of truth we experience are about the past and the present, and these are the easiest to see and confirm, but there are also truths about cause and effect.
Identityis the truth of description. A circle is round because we define a circle as round. You can say, “a circle is rectangular in shape,” and all you’ve done is confused us. Words only work because we agree on what they mean.
Demagogues often play with the identity of words, as it distracts us.
Axiomatictruth is truth about the system. The Peano axioms, for example, define the rules of arithmetic. They are demonstrably true and the system is based on these truths. Einstein derived his theories of special and general relativity with a pad of paper, not with an experiment (though the experiments that followed have demonstrated that his assertions were in fact true.)
There were loud voices in mid-century Germany who said that Einstein’s work couldn’t be true because of his heritage, and many others who mis-described his work and then decried that version of it, but neither approach changed the ultimate truth of his argument.
Axiomatic truth, like most other truths, doesn’t care whether you understand it or believe it or not. It’s still true.
Historictruth is an event that actually happened. We know it happened because it left behind evidence, witnesses and other proof.
Experimentaltruth may not have the clear conceptual underpinnings of axiomatic truth, but it holds up to scrutiny. The world is millions of years old. Every experiment consistently demonstrates this. Experimental truth can also give us a road map to the future. Vaccines do not cause autism. The world is not flat. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is rising.
If you want to challenge an experimental truth, the only response is to do a better experiment, make it replicable and show your work.
Personalexperiencetruth is the truth that’s up to you. How you reacted to what happened can only be seen and reported by you.
And finally, considerculturaltruth, and this is the truth thatcanchange. This is the truth of, “people like us do things like this.” Which is true, until it’s not. And then people like us do something else.","May 16, 2019","truth, identity, experimental"
Reach is overrated,"It might be the biggest misconception in all of advertising.
The Super Bowl has reach.
Google has reach.
Radio has reach.
So?
Why do you care if you can, for more money, reach more people?
Why wouldn’t it make more sense to reach the right people instead?
To pick an absurd example, you can use a giant radio telescope to beam messages to the billions or trillions of aliens that live in other solar systems. Worth it?
I read an overview that pointed out that one of the cons of Amazon advertising was that they didn’t have the reach of Google.
This is wrong in so many ways.
Reach doesn’t matter, because your job isn’t to interrupt people on other planets, with other interests. Your job is to interact with people who care.
Running an ad on the most popular podcast isn’t smart if the most popular podcast reaches people who don’t care about you.
Perhaps it makes sense to pay extra to reach precisely the right people. It never makes sense to pay extra to reach more people.","May 15, 2019","Advertising, Reach, Target Audience"
Lifelong connection,"It lives right next to lifelong learning.
Lifelong learning is the mindset of possibility. It is built on the idea that we can grow if we simply show up, ready to learn.
Lifelong learning is never finished, and achieving the mindset isn’t easy, because the existing bias toward competence makes it socially unattractive. It requires us to acknowledge that we don’t know enough on our way to learning more.
And lifelong connection? That’s our commitment to engaging with people who will help us see what’s possible–and that in return, we’ll support them on their journey.
This is not the easily monetized connection of digital social networks. Those networks seek to maximize a simple metric (likes, friends and followers, all three of which should be in air quotes because the words don’t mean what they appear to mean). It’s more difficult than that.
We founded thealtMBA(and the otherAkimboworkshops) with a focused commitment on lifelong learning. I believe that it’s our urgent obligation (and precious opportunity) to learn more and make things better for those around us.
What we’ve found, though, is that it’s the lifelong journey of connection that powers that learning. That surrounding ourselves with others on the same path is at least as useful as learning something new. To that end, we’ve spent the last year building an online community called Forward Link where the more than 10,000 alumni from our workshops are connecting with and challenging each other on the way forward.
At the end of each seminar, we invite our students to join with the others who are already part of our growing circle.
Drip by drip, day by day. It’s not dramatic, but that’s how we get there.","May 14, 2019","Lifelong Learning, Connection, Community"
Toward abundant systems,"Industrialism is based on scarcity. So is traditional college admissions. In fact, much of the world as we know it is based on hierarchies, limited shelf space, and resources that are difficult to share.
This leads to a common mindset: if it’s yours, it’s not mine. Sharing is something we teach to little kids, but in real life, we’re much busier keeping track of who’s up and who’s down in an endless status game.
But some systems are based on abundance. A language, for example, is more valuable when more people know it. The network effect helps us understand that for connection-based systems, more is actually better, not worse. Interoperability is a benefit. Cultural connection is an asset.
Wikipedia is more valuable than a traditional encyclopedia. That’s because there are unlimited pages and room for ever more editors. The system works better when more people use it.
The cultural turning point of our moment in time, the one that’s just beginning to be realized, is that education is an abundant system, not a scarce one.
Space on the Harvard campus is highly valued and also scarce.
But if we can break education out of the campus/scarcity mindset and instead focus on learning, learning at scale, learning that happens despite status not because of it–then we can begin to shift many of the other power structures in our society.
The more people who know something, the more it can be worth, because knowledge permits interoperability and forward motion. Knowledge creates more productivity, more connection and then, more knowledge.
It’s not enough, but it’s a start.","May 13, 2019","abundance, education, sharing"
Trapped by the incoming,"The incoming is coming to you because a while ago, you did something brave and generous and risky.
Incoming is great. It’s a reward for your impact. It’s a chance to serve and to make a difference. And it enables you to go to work every day.
If you spend all your time dealing with the incoming, though, you’ll have no time and no energy to create the next thing.

Role models as a tool for decision making,"Innovation is essential, but it’s rarely true that we do something that’s truly never been done before.
And that means that our work istowardsomething. We’re making decisions, taking risks and expending effort to get from here closer to there, where there is a place that’s been visited before.
Are you spending time in the gym trying to be more like Jackie Joyner-Kersee or Dwayne Johnson? Do your policies push our country to be more like China or Denmark? Will this policy create a place that looks like Bakersfield or Portland? Are you investing in the style of Warren Buffet or Mary Meeker?
The role model’s image brings with it all of the nuance that’s missing from a dry discussion of tactics. It forces us to get real and to look further into the future.

Time travel is exhausting,"If you’re imagining your future and then looking back at today through a rear-view mirror, it can wear you out.
Writing a book (all caps, WRITING A BOOK) or preparing for a TED talk (already in all caps) can paralyze an ordinarily productive person.
At the same time, tweeting is easy for a lot of people.
That’s because Twitter makes the false promise that it’s all about now. Whatever. Write what you’re doing, or feeling, or angry about. It’ll be obsolete in ten minutes. No future, no rear view mirror.
On the other hand, a book feels permanent. It’s not for now, it’s for later. It’s your testament, something for strangers to read.
And so, when you sit to write your book (or your blog, for that matter), you imagine who’s going to read it, one day in the future. And then you reflect from that distant, amorphous place back to now.
Time travel.
Without a doubt, we need to do this now and then. We need the discipline to think hard about the implications of our actions. We need to plan, to envision, to make trade-offs. It keeps us on track, doing work we’re proud of.
But when you find that it’s paralyzing you, it might be better to get back to now. Sit around the campfire and simply tell your story. Your story as of now, for the people who are with you, now.","May 10, 2019","time travel, writing, presence"
Embracing your incompetence,"You can’t be great at everything. None of us are.
The question is: What will you do about it? What will you do about the areas where you don’t have the commitment, time or skill to be exceptional?
One approach is to never talk about it. It’s off limits. Do the work poorly, but pretend you don’t.
Another approach is to talk about it with zeal. Work to find resources you can use to avoid the things you do poorly. Find a cohort that will challenge you to get better. Find new and better ways to improve…

Selling insurance to your sister,"There are people in your inner circle who trust you. Family members, close work colleagues, college alumni, dear friends–they will give you the benefit of the doubt.
Think twice before turning this circle into prospects by selling them products and services.
First, it doesn’t scale. You don’t have enough relatives to cash in on.
But far more important, these relationships are precious. These are the people who will help you level up, who see you, who care about your future. They are the ones who will tell you the truth and will challenge you to become a better version of yourself. Don’t burn this down on the lazy road to your next paycheck.
If your product or service isn’t good enough to sell to strangers now, it’s not going to be good enough after you sell it to your inner circle.

Do things get better?,"Maybe.
Improvability is a choice.
You can build a society, an organization or a family with improvement in mind. Either things are static or we’re putting effort into making them better. Here are some of the elements:
Assertions are welcome
Information flows in all directions
Falsifiable assertions are tested, and the successful ones are embraced
There’s forward economic motion
Authority is used to get things done, not to simply end discussion
Proven assertions from the past are accepted until more effective new assertions replace them
The new is shipped on a regular basis
Individuals are encouraged to engage with strange ideas and the strangers who create them
Alternative methods are not seen as disloyal
There are common goals
No graft, no bribery, no external hidden agendas
People show their work and don’t fear insight on their methods
Mistakes are embraced when they lead to forward progress or simply encourage assertion making
It’s not okay to blame the ref for results you don’t like
Most of all, there’s a consistent process in place. A process that doesn’t change even as the work does. That process doesn’t get pushed aside every time a leader feels threatened.
There are one or two of these elements that need expanding:
Assertions are educated guesses about what might work better. They are coherent theories of how a problem can be solved or explanations of how a system works. It’s impossible to be sure of your assertion, but that doesn’t mean you should never make one.
A falsifiable assertion is one that can be proven to be wrong. If it’s not falsifiable, it’s not a useful assertion. Saying that a giant green leprechaun determines the winning lottery numbers isn’t helpful, since we can’t prove that it’s not true.
And forward economic motion: It’s easier to turn a boat that’s already moving. Forward motion means more incoming, more decisions, more deal flow. All of which lead to more ways to learn and more ways to improve.","May 7, 2019","Improvability, Assertions, Economic Motion"
College confusion,"While a high-status college admission confers a measure of status, it doesn’t automatically grant a great education.
Sometimes, a student gets both, but not always. Because learning is taken as much as given.
Along the way, many of us have conflated the status with the learning.
We’re also confused about the correlation between big college sports and the expected outputs of a university.
One symptom: We often say “good college” when we mean “famous college.”
And so, the college one goes to doesn’t tell us very much at all about what someone learned, or even about who they are. It merely demonstrates that when they were 18 years old, a combination of luck and signaling led to them being chosen (or not).
It’s not personal. And it’s not predictive. Unless we allow it to be.

When your project isn’t making money,"It might be that you’re losing money on every sale
(Which means that each and every item you sell, every service you perform, costs you money. Bigger won’t make you better…)
(Low price is the last refuge of leadership that doesn’t have the guts to make a great product and tell a true story to the right people)
(Some customers want to pay more than others, and some customers want to get more—of something—than others)
(Your factory processes may be unsophisticated)
Are you aware of work in process, cash flow and cycle times? Are you doing custom work in a batch business, or vice versa?
What are you outsourcing? Is the time and money you spend on every step rewarded by the customer you serve?
(Because people do what they want, and they respond to training and respect and opportunity)
(And that’s a hard one to fix)
(Systems thinking matters)
It might be that your costs of acquiring a new customer are more than that customer is worth
(Because your marketing message is incorrect)
Because there’s a mismatch between your story and the worldview of those you seek to serve.
Because the people you seek to serve don’t think they need you.
Because it costs too much to tell these people you exist.
Because the people you seek to serve don’t trust you.
Because you’re lying when you make promises.
Because you’re overspending or underspending on marketing.
(often, it’s the underspenders that are in real trouble)
Because you’re focusing on the wrong channels to tell your story.
(just because social media is fun to talk about doesn’t mean it works)
Because you don’t have a connection ratchet, a business that leads to a network effect, where success begets more success because the more people use you, the more they want their friends and colleagues to use you as well.
Because your product isn’t sufficiently developed.
Because the people you seek to serve don’t talk about you, thus, you’re not remarkable.
Or the people you seek to serve don’t like to talk about anyone, and your efforts to be remarkable are wasted.
Because your product doesn’t earn traction with your customers, they wouldn’t miss you if you were gone–the substitutes are easy.
Because even though you’re trying hard, you’re being selfish, focusing on your needs instead of having empathy for those you seek to serve.
It might be that your scale is wrong
You may have created an organization that’s profitable at a much bigger (or smaller size) but the mismatch between your overhead (all that rent, all those people, all of those services you pay for) and your total sales is way off.
It’s smarter than ever to be very small–but occasionally, there are significant rewards for being the efficient giant.
It’s rare that being in the middle is the Goldilocks happy medium you were hoping for.
That’s it, that might be all of it.
Either your marginal costs are too high compared to your price, or the fixed price of marketing is too high, or your overhead is too high (meaning your sales are too low for the size of your organization).
Within those three areas, there are many sub-riffs:
It might be that you’re too early to the market.
There are early adopters, certainly, but maybe not enough, or not willing to pay your price…
Being too early also means that your costs are higher and your forward motion is slower.
And it might be that you’re too late.
Which means that the people who were interested, interesting and willing to pay extra already have their needs met, and all you’re left with is bottom-fishing, bargain-hunting late adopters.
It might be that you’re slow moving when those you seek to serve want speedWhat you make isn’t usually as important as how it makes your customers feel.
You might not be focused enough on a specific segment of the marketplace, a place where you can cross the chasm and reach the customers who are waiting for a tested and proven option.
It’s possible you say ‘yes’ when you should frequently be saying ‘no’.
You may have a staffing problem, with senior people doing their job instead of working on the mission of solving interesting problems and scaling up their tactics.
It’s likely that you’re being reactive, doing what the market tells you instead of bending the market in the direction you want it to go
(But, it’s almost as likely that you’re spending too much time and energy bending the market in a way it’s not eager to bend, and if you spent more time fitting into the slot that’s being offered, you could generate the traction you’re looking for.)
A lot of this is called “marketing” but too often, when faced with problems like these, we end up spending time shouting, hyping and cutting promotional corners instead of doing the hard work of understanding what we make, how we make it and who we make it for.
I know this is a long list. But the good news is that once you find what’s broken, you can fix it.","May 3, 2019","business profitability, customer acquisition, marketing strategy"
The minimizing coin,"If your habit is to clear your throat, apologize a few times, minimize the quality of the work you’re about to share and in general, apologize for the assertions you’re about to make…
you probably realize that this is not an effective way to give a talk, lead a class or have a strategic discussion.
Consider carrying a coin in your pocket, one that’s large, or in a foreign currency.
Every time you feel like you need to minimize your contribution, simply stop and turn the coin over. You can count that as your obligation fulfilled.
And then you can get back to work.

Constraints and measurement,"These are the two axes of professional design and engineering.
Did you produce within the constraints?
Did you deliver measurable results?
That’s it.
Good design doesn’t exceed the available resources and produces measurable change against the agreed upon objectives.
Great design is better than good design because it uses fewer resources and/or creates even better results.
If you need to build a bridge, yes, of course you could build one out of unobtainium and even an amateur could build one that can’t carry truck traffic, but a professional engineer eagerly accepts the constraints she signed up for and insists on measuring just how much wear and tear the bridge can actually handle.
Direct marketing, curriculum design, product testing, movie-making–they all live within the axes of constraints and performance.
They just opened the long-awaited Terminal B at LaGuardia Airport, previously one of the worst major airports in the world. And while it’s shiny, the failures of engineering and design are everywhere. At 6 am, the line for the ladies room is 20 people long. The space constraints can’t be eased (constraints enable architecture) but the throughput would have been easy to measure at the blueprint stage. This part of the billion-dollar facility had just one job, and it failed.
The same is true for the design of the simple coffee stand. It doesn’t require a breakthrough in retail engineering to create an espresso bar that can serve grumpy pre-caffeinated travelers with speed and grace. But despite the hard work of the tradespeople who followed the plans, the plans themselves were defective. The outcome of their poor design decisions is obvious to anyone looking at the line of 30 people.
Forward motion happens when we see the best practices of our craft and exceed them. The privilege of design and engineering comes with the responsibility to be measured, and to redo our work when it doesn’t measure up.
“Give me constraints” and “Measure my performance” are rarely heard, except when talented and passionate designers go to work.","June 26, 2019","Constraints, Measurement, Design"
"The tyranny of small debts, compounded","The simple but hard to follow rule is this:Only borrow money to buy things that go up in value.
In the old days, that meant a house and a college education, because you’d probably earn enough from either to pay back the debt, with interest. Today, housing is unpredictable and many forms of student debt are crushing (and the yield on the most expensive forms of education isn’t as high as it might be).
You can justify borrowing money to buy a car if the car enables you to make enough money to pay the debt back… But medallion cab owners in New York have recently learned that there are few sure things.
The deal with credit card debt, though is simply terrible. The credit card companies pay 2% on their interest-bearing accounts, but charge around NINE times that on the debt that some people carry–that’s a huge gap. It’s a lousy deal you should avoid if you possibly can, regardless of how unfair the economy is.
Lately, there’s been a lot of handwringing about the long-term impact of a daily treat like a cup of coffee. TheTimesgot this completely wrong yesterday, pushing people deeper into a trap that they should run away from. And the WashingtonPostpoints out that the number of people getting a loan for their wedding is skyrocketing. This is a problem. Here’s a simple way to see why:

You can make a copy of thespreadsheetI built (hit MAKE A COPY or download) and then play with the numbers yourself.
The sad news is that the best you can do within an industrial system that makes it harder and harder to catch up through effort is to begin by avoiding debt. It turns out that paying interest on interest is a long-term trap.
The real win is to borrow money to embrace high-yield education, and then borrow money if you need it to build an asset, a business that creates value for you and the people you serve.

The economic cost is tiny. Make a mistake with a kohlrabi and you’re out about a dollar–less than it cost you to drive to work.
But the emotional cost, depending on how you’ve trained yourself, could be high indeed.

The mythical “Head of Marketing”,"Most organizations have someone that they call thehead of marketing, but unlike the other departments, this person’s job is usually more tactical and less strategic than it could be.
That’s because the boss isn’t willing to let go of the decisions that are actually at the heart of marketing.
The boss is holding on tight to the answers to questions like, “who’s it for” and “what’s it for?” The boss certainly isn’t ceding responsibility for the company’s posture and the change it seeks to make.
So, it’s a bit disingenuous to call this marketing person the ‘head’ of anything.
I’m seeing the same thing with project managers who seek to extend their span of control to things that growth hackers get all excited about.
Head of marketing operationsis probably more accurate, right?
In fact, the head of marketing is often more of a consigliere, charged with making a case to the CEO. If the boss is any good, she’ll listen carefully, ask hard questions and then make a smart decision. The rest of the time, the head of marketing is mostly following the lead of the boss. That’s because marketing is everything that the organization does that interacts with a member of the public. Marketing is personal, it’s vivid and it has its fingers in everything.
To be the head of marketing, you need the freedom and responsibility to change the way things work, not simply how they’re talked about.
At brand-oriented companies like Unilever, the brand manager has far more influence than she might at a place like Facebook, Basecamp or Slack, where it seems like the degrees of freedom are much narrower.If you want a marketing head, you need to give them the freedom to actually do marketing.
The reason that the tenure of a CMO at a big company averages about 18 months is that it takes a year and a half for the boss to realize that pain-free, risk-free, easy miracles aren’t arriving on schedule.","June 20, 2019","Marketing Leadership, Organizational Structure, CMO Tenure"
Of course it could be better,"That’s not the question, not really.
The question is, “what are you going to do about it?”

Awkward memorization,"The spread of TED talks means that more and more people are being put on stage and told to memorize their talk.

Investing in slack,"If your delivery drivers have to do six deliveries a day, they’ll rush from the first moment. They’ll be super efficient at easily measurable metrics. They’ll cut a few corners.
If they only have to makefivedeliveries, you can ask them to spend that ‘down’ time doing things your customers will actually remember. They can invest in less easily measurable metrics. Instead of cutting corners, they’ll embrace them.
Systems with slack are more resilient. The few extra minutes of time aren’t wasted, the same way that a bike helmet isn’t wasted if you don’t have a crash today. That buffer will save the day, sooner or later.
One thunderstorm can cripple the air traffic system for six major cities, because each plane is stacked so efficiently that the ripple cascades, leading to failure and cancellations. In the old days, when efficiency was measured over a longer term, there was enough buffer to absorb a bump like that.
The mistake happens when we over-index on the easily measured short-term wins and forget to account for the costs of system failure.
Competitive environments push profit seekers to reduce slack and to play a short-term game. If your organization hits the wall, the market will survive, because we have other options. But that doesn’t meanyouwill survive.

The Learning/Doing Gap,"Our society separates them. Somewhere along the way, we decided that one interfered with the other.
Go to school for 8 years to become a doctor–most of that time, you’re learning about doctoring, not actually doing doctoring.
Go to work as a copywriter. Most of the time, you’re doing writing, not learning about new ways to write.
The thing we usually seek to label as ‘learning’ is actually more about ‘education’. It revolves around compliance, rankings and “will this be on the test?”
Being good at school is not the same as learning something.
One reason that we don’t incorporate doing into education is that it takes the authority away from those that would seek to lecture and instruct.
There are 56 million people in K-12 (compulsory education) in the US right now. Most of them do nothing all day but school, failing to bring real-life activity, experimentation and interaction into the things that they are being taught.
And there are more than a hundred million people going to their jobs every day in the US, but few of them read books or take lessons regularly about how to do their work better. That’s considered a distraction or, at best, inconvenient or simply wasted time.
The gap is real. It often takes a decade or more for a profession to accept and learn a new approach. It took gastroenterologists a generation before they fully accepted that most ulcers were caused by bacteria and changed their approach. It has taken our justice system more than thirty years to take a hard look at sentencing and corrections.
It could be because we’re confusing learning with education. That education (someone else is in charge and I might fail) is a power shift from doing, so I’d rather be doing, thank you very much.
What happens if the learning we do is accomplished by always engaging in it in conjunction with our doing?
And what happens if we take a hard look at our doing and spend the time to actually learn something from it?
When police departments invest time in studying their numbers and investigating new approaches, they discover that efficacy and productivity goes up, safety improves and so does job satisfaction.
When science students devise and operate their own lab tests, their understanding of the work dramatically improves.
Education (the compliance-based system that all of us went through) is undergoing a massive shift, as big as the ones that have hit the other industries that have been rebuilt by the connection and leverage the internet brings. And yet, too much of the new work is simply coming up with a slightly more efficient way to deliver lectures plus tests.
I see this every day. People show up atAkimboexpecting lifetime access to secret videos, instead of the hard but useful work of engagement.
The alternative?Learning. Learning that embraces doing. The doing of speaking up, reviewing and be reviewed. The learning of relevant projects and peer engagement. Learning and doing together, at the same time, each producing the other.
If you want to learn marketing, do marketing. If you want to do marketing, it helps to learn marketing.
That same symmetric property applies to just about everything we care about.
To quote the ancient rockers, “We don’t need no… education.”
But we could probably benefit from some learning.
In the middle of all this doing, this constant doing, we might benefit from learning to do it better.","June 11, 2019","Learning, Doing, Education"

(Did you see what I just did there? I could have said, “You can show your friends that you have money to burn,” but I didn’t.)
Overwriting has a long tradition, particularly among academics. Make it a bit more complex and wordy than it needs to be. Write run-on sentences. Apparently, complicated writing must be more true.
One reason for this commitment to overwriting is that it keeps the hordes away. It’s difficult to read and hard to imagine writing. And so scarcity is created.
And yet, the articles and books that stand the test of time are straightforward. They’re memorable. They can be understood by the reader you seek to serve.

But what is this question for?,"If you are asked a question in a job interview, on stage or even on a date, there’s probably a reason, and the reason might not be because the person asking wants to know your answer.
Teenagers are terrible at understanding this.
“How was your day at school,” is not a question asked to determine how a day at school was. It’s a (lousy) attempt at starting a conversation about feelings.
It requires empathy to answer a question that isn’t obviously about the answer.
The empathy to see that the person asking you has something else in mind.
Back when I was hiring dozens of people at Yoyodyne, I asked one of the hackneyed programmer interview questions (back then, it wasn’t nearly as well known.) “How many gas stations are there in the US?”
It should have been obvious that I didn’t actually want to know how many gas stations there were. That was easy to look up, and why would I ask someone I didn’t know a question like that?
Over time, I had to get more and more clear in my messaging. “Because I want to see how you figure out amorphous problems, help me understand how you would answer a question like…” Even then, it was a very powerful tell. Two people said, “I don’t have a car,” and left the interview. (That’s true, not hyperbole).
Other than name and phone number, when someone asks you a question, it’s worth considering why. Intentionally answering the real question is a great place to start.

Junction City,"A dozen states in the US have a Junction City.
A place with the claim to fame that it’s on the way to somewhere else.
You can do well being a stepping stone, a pathway, a place people go to get somewhere else.
Or you can be a place where people seek to be.
Yahoo grew as a place to stay. They built one service after another, hoping for time on site.
Google, on the other hand, began as a place to visit when you wanted to go somewhere else. That’s their entire business model. Time on site wasn’t as important to them as the accuracy of their direction. Come to leave.
Facebook, on the other hand, is organized to be a one-way street, with people staying on the site as long as possible.
Of course, it’s not simply web sites that work this way. Either we organize for junctions and trajectory, or we build our place as a destination, physically or as metaphor.

Roads or buildings?,"If you want to make a long-term impact, build the roads.
Stewart Brand points out that if you compare two maps of downtown Boston–from 1860 and 1960, for example–virtually every single building has been replaced. Gone.
But the roads? They haven’t changed a bit. The curbs and boundaries and connections are largely as they were. With the exception of a Big Dig, a Robert Moses or an earthquake, the roads last forever.
That’s because systems built around communication, transportation and connection need near-unanimous approval to change. Buildings, on the other hand, begin to morph as soon as the owner or tenant decides they need to.
When creating an organization, a technology or any kind of culture, the roads are worth far more than the buildings.

Surrounded by yes,"It’s good news and bad news.
The web knows what you like and it’s working hard to surround you with reminders that you’re right.
This is good news because it can help an outsider feel more normal. If you have something you’re interested in, you’ll see more of it, news about it, affirmations… all of which will help you find the confidence to speak up and lead. Everywhere you look, you’ll see reminders that the world is actually just the way you hoped.
And this is bad news because it amplifies bad behavior. It normalizes behavior that successful cultures work hard to diminish. This reinforcement makes your bubble ever thicker and makes it easy to believe that in fact, the world does revolve around you.

Of course they’re wrong,"It seems like our take on culture is that we’reright.
We shake hands properly, use a napkin properly, speak up at events properly and even greet one another on the street properly.
When I’m in a foreign city, I’m always amazed at how (friendly/offputting/aloof/intimate) everyone else is.
But of course, everyone else is right as well. They’re the home team, so they’re even more right than I am.
The conflict seems pretty obvious:
We can’t all be wrong, which means we can’t all be right, either.
Culture, by its very definition, isn’t the work of being right. It’s the work of being in sync.
Culture ispeople like us do things like this.
So sure, the way WE do this is ‘right’ if right means, ‘the way we do this.’ But there’s little room for absolutes. Culture abhors the absolute, it is based in the specific instead.
The next time you bump into a culture that you disagree with, perhaps it might be more useful to wonder about how it got that way, and would happen ifwedid it that way?

The key part of new media,"It’s thenewpart.
“How am I supposed to use this?” is the common question. You’re supposed to have a certain tone in your tweets, a certain format to your Facebook posts. You’re supposed to have comments on your blog and your YouTube videos should have a certain look, feel and length.
When MTV was the hitmaker of the music industry, it quickly became clear what a music video was supposed to look like.
Nonsense.
Matching the vernacular is a fine starting point if you don’t want to spend time or energy questioning the form. But in fact, questioning the form, embracing the new part of the medium is precisely where forward motion happens.
Our newinstagram accountis pioneering minibooks and other non-traditional ways to use the medium. This blog hasn’t had comments in a long time. Trailblazers have run telethons, talk shows and other surprising formats on Facebook. I don’t useTwitter‘properly’ but that’s okay. Apodcastdoesn’t have to have guests.

On the other hand, if you’re trying to express disappointment or displeasure, you could write, “I’m disappointed that you weren’t able to contribute more here. We were really looking forward to your input.”
The problem with sarcasm is that the level of displeasure is hidden. You might come across as snarky when you don’t mean to, or, the snarkiness you were sending might not land.

The perfect mustard,"If you ask for mustard at a French bistro, you’ll get a strong Dijon, handmade in a little village three hundred kilometres away.
If you ask for mustard at a game atFenway, apparently you’ll get Gulden’s.
Within a rounding error, all mustard costs the same. It’s not about the price. It’s about coherence with the story. When a Marriott brings you the little sealed bottle of fake dijon from Heinz, they’re not offering you mustard, they’re sending a signal about what they think is fancy.
And at the ball game, the yellow mustard in a giant pump tells a story as well.
Is onebetterthan the other? It’s a matter of taste and context. Of course, I have a favorite mustard and a narrative about what’s appropriate in a given setting, and so does just about everyone else I know. But favorite is different than ‘right’. There’s no absolute scale. How can a mustard be yuppie? Pretentious? Down to earth? It’s simply a condiment.
And yes, there’s a mustard analogy in everything you do. In how you shake hands, in the typeface you use in your presentation (and whether you call it a ‘font’), in the volume you choose for your voice when in conversation.

Pivoting the education matrix,"For the longest time, school has been organized around subjects. Fifth graders go to math class and then English class and then geography.
Mostly, those classes don’t teach what they say they teach. Sure, there are some facts, but mostly it’s the methods of instruction that are on offer.Schoolusually has a different flavor thanlearning.
It turns out, the skills we need to use in life (and in school) aren’t subject specific. But we use those subjects to teach the skills we actually end up using. Everyone knows that the typical person doesn’t need binomials, but the argument is that problem-solving, etc, are totally worth learning and so we pretend to teach the subject when apparently, we’re teaching the skill.
Perhaps, instead of organizing school around data acquisition and regurgitation, we could identify what the skills are and separate them out, teaching domain knowledge inconjunctionwith the skill, not the other way around.
It turns out that the typical school spends most of its time on justoneof those skills (obediencethrough comportment and regurgitation).
What would happen if we taught each skill separately?
ObedienceManagementLeadership/cooperationProblem-solvingMindfulnessCreativityAnalysis
Indeed, you are required to do all seven of these things in math class, but in what proportion? Is a kid who has trouble with obedience “bad at math,” or is it that the obedience part of a class got in the way of the analysis or problem-solving part of the class instead?
It’s entirely possible for a kid to make it through 16 years of organized schooling with a solid B average and never do much more than do well on just one thing–remembering what’s on the test. We’ve failed when we’ve turned out someone with just one of the 7 skills.
What happens if we are clear what we’re doing and why? Because obedience isn’t the point of math or science, but sometimes it’s taught that way.
And then, when obedience session is over, we can find other ways to approach the work at hand, developing the other essential skills. A 45 minute Creativity class that uses algebra is going to feel very different from a Leadership class covering the same material.
Some kids spend a decade in the school sports system and learn leadership and management and creativity and analysis. And some learn nothing but how to follow the coach’s instructions and sit on the bench. This has nothing to do with sports (or geography or biology) and everything to do with what we decide we’re teaching in any given moment.
Is there a cognitive difference between solving a chemistry problem and solving a crossword puzzle? Not really. Getting good at solving–putting on your solving hat and finding the guts to use it–is a skill that gets buried under the avalanche that we call obedience.
“How’d you do in Creativity today, son?” or perhaps, “Wow, you got an A in Analysis–that’s going to open a lot of doors for you…”
Bureaucracies over-index for obedience. They do that out of self-preservation, and because it’s the easiest thing to sell to clients, funders and parents (and to measure). But since we’re currently overdoing that one (they do it far more in other countries, though), we end up getting confused about what it means to learn a subject area in a useful way and we definitely under-develop people on the other six skills.

Sneaky surveys (and push polls),"Firstthing: All open access online surveys are essentially inaccurate, because the group that takes the time to answer the survey is usually different from the general public.
Secondthing: Don’t confuse a survey with a census. A survey asks a randomized but representative group some questions and then seeks to extend the answers to the entire group as a whole. A census seeks to askeveryonein the group, so that no generalization is required.
In general, you don’t need a census. What you need is a correctly representational group, which can be dramatically smaller than the entire population. The huge mistake is believing that you need to survey more and more people. You don’t. And your work to reach more people actually makes your survey less accurate not more (see the first thing). And yes, this is true even if you’re a solo creator wondering if your novel is any good.
In the age of good stats, the best use of a census is to establish a 1:1 relationship between what someone feels and who that person is. Asking every single person at a restaurant what they want for dinner is a census, a useful one, because you can then serve each person exactly what they want for dinner.
Third: You might believe the survey someone just emailed you to fill out is anonymous. It probably isn’t. Check out thisexplanationfrom Survey Monkey. It turns out that tracking by IP and even email address/name is a built-infeature. If you get a survey link by email or even as you browse a site, it’s a safe guess to imagine that your answers are tied in some way to your other interactions with the organization that posted the survey. Respondent beware.
Andfourth: Asking someone a question can change the way they feel. Done crudely, this is called a push poll (“Did you know that Bob was indicted last year?”) but even asking someone a thoughtful question about their satisfaction can increase it.
Okay, two more things:
At the conclusion of the endless surveys when they ask you if you have anything else to add, don’t bother. It’s not like the CEO is busy reading your comments.
The single best way to figure out how people feel isn’t to ask them with some focus-group survey. It’s to watch what they do when given the choice. “This or that?” is a great way to get to the truth of our preferences.","July 27, 2019","surveys, data accuracy, respondent behavior"
Too big to care,"The marketing math is compelling. It’s obvious that the most highly-leveraged moment in every brand’s relationship with a customer is the moment when something goes wrong.
In that moment, when a promise was broken, the customer sees the true nature of the brand. We make up stories about the brands in our lives, but we believe that when the promise is broken we’re about to see the truth of that story.
As brands get bigger (and bigger might be as small as an organization with just two people in it), policies kick in. Policies and budgets and bureaucracy.
The brand has become too big to care. I mean, it might be big enough topretendto care. To have policies that appear to set things right. But they don’t really care.
The only way to really care is to have human beings who care (and to give them the authority and resources to demonstrate that.)

In 1995, Oprah got to put just one person as the lead in an episode of her show. That choice was a commitment and a signal. It said to her viewers, “there were many people who could have been on the show today, but I chose this person.”
In 2000, Random House got to pick one book to be their big business title for November. Just one. Their curation sent a message to bookstores, who stocked more copies as a result.
They were curators and their curation led to promotion and attention. There was a cost to picking junk, and a benefit to earning trust.
The tech giants have surrendered that ability, with the costs and benefits that come with it. They end up disrespecting creations and their creators.
It doesn’t matter if you know someone at Google or if Amazon promises that they’re going to heavily promote your new Kindle book. The people who work at these companies don’t have a dial to turn. Amazon is good at selling everything, but they’re terrible at sellingathing.
Apple gets some zing for a recommended podcast now and then, or for a heavily promoted record, but the same rule is generally true with them–98% of all their content is driven by the algorithm, not a human with something at stake. They don’t care which record you pay for, as long as you pay for something.
The platforms are built on the idea that the audience plus the algorithm do all the deciding. No curation, no real promotion, simply the system, grinding away.
This inevitably leads to pandering, a race to the bottom.
Netflix is an exception because they have so much at stake in the investment of their own products that they insist on curating and promoting, bending the algorithm in the direction they wish it to go.
When a site tries to do both (like Buzzfeed), it’s a perilous journey. The metrics and the algorithm will swallow up the best intent of taste and culture making.","July 25, 2019","curation, promotion, algorithm"
Comparing % and mass,"Direct marketers don’t care how many people they reach.
They care what percentage take action.
Brand marketers have trouble measuring action, so all they have to work with is reach.
If you can measure, stop worrying about big numbers when it comes to reach. Run away from the Super Bowl or a billboard on the main highway.
Small audiences are your friend, because small audiences are specific, and specific increases your percentage.","July 24, 2019","direct marketing, audience targeting, measurement"
Three wishes,"When you’re feeling stuck with your project, grab three index cards.
On each card, write down an element of the project that, if you invested time and money, would change for the better.
If those three things happened, if those three elements improved, what would happen to your project?
Okay, now that you’ve got all three… what are you going to do about it?","July 23, 2019","project improvement, problem-solving, goal-setting"
Where will the media take us next?,"Since the first story was carved on a rock, media pundits have explained that they have simply given people what they want, reporting the best they can on what’s happening.
Cause(the culture, human activity, people’s desires) leads toeffect(front page news).
In fact, it’s becoming ever more clear that the attention-seeking, profit-driven media industrial complex drives our culture even more than it reports on it.
Thoughtful people regularly bemoan our loss of civility, the rise of trolling and bullying and most of all, divisive behavior designed to rip people apart instead of moving us productively forward.
And at the very same time, reality TV gets ever better ratings. So much so that the news has become the longest-running, cheapest to produce and most corrosive TV show in history. Increase that exponentially by adding in the peer-to-peer reality show that is social media, and you can see what’s happening.
Imagine two classrooms, each filled with second graders.
In the first classroom, the teacher shines a spotlight on the bullies, the troublemakers and the fighters, going so far as to arrange all the chairs so that the students are watching them and cheering them on all day.
In the second classroom, the teacher establishes standards, acts as a damper on selfish outliers and celebrates the generous and productive kids in the classroom…
How will the classrooms diverge? Which one would you rather have your child enrolled in?
We’re not in elementary school anymore, and the media isn’t our teacher or our nanny. But the attention we pay to the electronic channels we click on consumes more of our day than we ever spent with Miss Binder in second grade. And that attention is corrosive. To us and to those around us.
Theproducersof reality TV know this. And they seek out more of it. When they can’t find it easily, they search harder. Because that’s their job.
It’s their job to amp up the reality show that is our culture.
But it’s not our job to buy into it. More than anything, profit-driven media needs our active participation in order to pay their bills.
It’s an asymmetrical game, with tons of behavioral research working against each of us–the uncoordinated but disaffected masses. Perhaps we can find the resolve to seek out the others, to connect and to organize in a direction that actually works.
The first step is to stop taking the bait. The second step is to say, “follow me.”","July 22, 2019","media influence, reality TV, cultural degradation"
Two kinds of system risk,"When you set up a system, it helps to keep in mind what will happen if it doesn’t work. Depending on the costs of ‘not working’, you can build more resilience into the system.
In most cases, ‘not working’ isn’t catastrophic. If your toaster doesn’t work, it’s not that big a deal. You can make toast in a few days and live with limp bread in the meantime. On the other hand, if you’re on a mission to Mars, you’ll probably be glad you packed a few extra oxygen tanks, even if the cost of bringing them is quite high.
We make two mistakes when we organize a system:
A useful skill in executive decision making is the ability to describe resiliency and the cost of failure in non-emotional ways. Especially when it’s difficult do precisely that.

Tailgating,"It doesn’t make you go any faster.

Say what you want,"Euphemism is easier than ever. Broad strokes, majestic language, big ideas… Mission statements and humanitarian motives.
It’s interesting to note that organized sports, one of the first places that hyperbloviation caught on, is still honest about the point of today’s game. “Our goal is to score more points than they do.”
It’s really clear what the team is trying to do.
Often, we’re so busy talking about our ideals and motivations that we forget to let our colleagues know precisely what we’re trying to do.
“Our goal is to make sure the State Senate votes no on this bill.”
“We want to sell 10,000 more packages this month.”
“Actually, all our shareholders care about is making a bigger quarterly sales number.”
The problem with focusing on only the short-term is that it leads people to cut corners, to create negative outcomes and to crumble in the face of change. Our overarching mission matters.
But being honest to yourself matters too.
If your team regularly suspends your stated overarching mission with thinly disguised emergencies in search of an outcome you’re not that proud of, it’s time to admit that the emergenciesarewhat you actually do.
Here’s a simple test: If a competitor came along who could achieve your stated mission faster and more effectively than you could, would you cheer them on?
If you’re not proud of what youactuallydo, perhaps you can explore doing something else instead.","July 19, 2019","Euphemism, honesty, mission"
Toward or away?,"Today, will you stand outside your boss’s office hoping that she’ll meet with you about your new project, or will you hunker down in your cube hoping she doesn’t notice you?

Will you track down a recalcitrant customer and see if you can make things better, or will you duck voice mail in case they’re trying to track you down?

Which sort of presentation is this?,"If you’re going to do a presentation (instead of sending a memo)…
If you’re going to do a sales call (instead of staying home)…
it’s because you want to make a change happen. What action are you seeking?
There are two kinds of changes you could work with:
1. There’s already a goal and a set of commitments, and here’s an update as to how to take appropriate action to reach that goal.
Example: The GPS in your car. It knows you want to go to Cleveland. It’s giving you an update about where to turn to get there, or an alert about traffic up ahead that will be relevant to your journey. Note the GPS isn’t asking you about why you want to go to Cleveland nor is it trying to get you to go somewhere else.
2. The presenter wants a change in priorities, to want something different.
Example: I know that you’ve never given to a charity like this one before, but once you see the urgency of what’s happening, it will change your mind.
If you’re doing a GPS update, then your presentation ought to be focused on communicating the facts and changes we know we need to take action on.
On the other hand, if you’re doing a presentation about changing people’s minds, please spare us the irrelevant coordinates and turn by turn announcements. You came for a change, please ask for it.","July 16, 2019","presentation, change, communication"
Paid to learn,"The rationale for traditional education is that more learning gets you a better job, and a job gets you paid, which makes the learning a worthwhile investment.
But what happensafteryou get that job?
In some organizations, that’s the end of that. You might pick up experience and wisdom on the job, but the short-sighted organization may view ongoing learning as too expensive.
The insight is to realize that stuck employees are far more expensive than educated ones.
More and more organizations have come to understand that paying their employees to learn, to really dig and learn something, is a bargain. An inspired and insightful employee is going to produce far more value than one who’s simply being ignored.
And employees are beginning to understand that the time and effort they put into continuing education comes back to them for the rest of their careers, because once you learn it, it’s something you can use again and again.
We put together the kernel ofa list of companies that actively reimburse their people for education. And a page with aninvitation for L&D leadersto consider thealtMBAas a tool for developing real skills among their key employees.

Judging a day by the weather,"It seems more productive to judge tomorrow by something more relevant, useful and in our control than whether or not it’s raining, doesn’t it?
We can judge a day by how many tools we get to use, how many people are open to hearing from us, how many problems are available to be solved.
Weather, or anything else that’s not in our short-term control, can become an excuse and a distraction. If you can’t do anything about it, it might not be worth your focus and energy.
We can begin by embracing the fact that we get a whole day to make an impact. We can open doors, find new resources and create value. In spite of or because of the prevailing conditions…",,"Productivity, Control, Impact"
What are you drawn to?,"All moths are the same.
For the right species, if you light a candle, the moths will show up. They’re drawn to it for little-understood reasons related to how they’re wired.
Just as moths seem to be the same, humans manage to be different.
How do you spend your unscheduled time? What distracts you or moves up your priority list?
Perhaps you’re drawn to danger.
To conflict.
To hedonistic pleasure.
Perhaps you’re drawn to take actions that avoid criticism.
To shiny objects or new opportunities.
To crossing things off the endless to-do list.
It could be that you can’t resist fixing a typo in someone else’s work, or that you’d rather win at a team sport than just about anything.
Maybe you want to do things that feel safe. Some people want to do things that actuallyaresafe.
For many, it’s either the avoidance of trouble or the desire for praise, but rarely both at the same time.
It could be that the highest priority is to fix what appears to be broken. Or it might be to avoid what appears broken and to run to the new, unsullied opportunity instead.
You might need to turn off all the lights and make all the beds before you leave the house. And you might be willing to trade everything just to be sure that the world at large doesn’t think for a moment that you’ve faltered in your work.

Principles and being let off the hook,"Principles that we suspend during difficult times aren’t really principles. Principles really count when they’re difficult to maintain.
That’s not the same thing, though, as refusing to consider the edge cases.
“Free speech,” is a fine principle, one to live by. But shouting “fire” in a crowded movie theater isn’t allowed, for good reason.
The edge cases are always subject to endless debate. There are no easy bright lines. It’s tempting, then, to never consider the edge cases. A rule’s a rule.
But principles without judgment aren’t the easy path they seem to be. Because without our judgment on the edge cases, we’ve given up responsibility. It’s no longer our decision if we’re not making a decision.
The hard work involves willingly being on the hook for making a tough call.","July 13, 2019","Principles, Judgment, Responsibility"
Next to the competition,"On Fisherman’s Wharf, there’s one restaurant after another. Is that a smart place to open a business, right next to all the others?

The thing is, books are impossible to sell when there aren’t a lot of books around. They don’t sell many books at Macy’s.

Open parentheses,"Technology shows up and changes the culture. The culture then enables new industries and movements, which further change the culture. And then technology shows up and puts an end to the system we were all used to.
The parentheses open, and then, perhaps, they close.
The pop-rock parentheses opened with the transistor radio (kids could listen to music without their parents) and closed with streaming (no scarcity meant long tail meant no mass market).
The publishing parentheses opened with Gutenberg and ended with the death of the bookstore. Digital books mean no scarce shelf space, no scarce paper, no power to the publisher, no mass market.
A door opens, and then, one day, it closes.
It’s easy to mourn the end of these eras, but in my lifetime, so many parentheses have opened…
Computers connect us–to resources, to truth and to each other (which can mean folk-truth instead of actual truth)
Medicine is truly a science, not a series of half-understood superstitions

"The $50,000 an hour gate agent","Conventional CEO wisdom is that top management is worth a fortune because of the high-leverage decisions they make.
But consider the work of Wade, an unheralded Air Canada gate agent. Yesterday, I watched him earn his employer at least $50,000 while getting paid perhaps .1% of that.
The microphone was out of order, but instead of screaming at the passengers, he walked over and spoke directly to the people who needed to hear him.
On his own, he started inquiring about the connection status of a family of four. He could have cleared the standby list, closed the flight and told the four that they’d have to find another way home. Or, he could have saved them their four seats, which would have flown empty if they hadn’t been filled. Instead of either path, he picked up the phone, organized other staff to find and expedite the family and get them on board.
And then, in an unrelated bit of valor, he tracked down a lost wallet and sent his #2 to fetch it from where it had been left–getting it to the plane before it left.
Most of all, in an era when loyalty is scarce, he probably increased the lifetime value of a dozen wavering customers by at least a few thousand dollars each.
Krulak’s Lawstates that the future of an organization is in the hands of the privates in the field, not the generals back home.
Unfortunately, management and a lack of trust get in the way of the work environment you’ll need to build to earn the human, dedicated work of the next Wade. Hopefully, the airline will put him in charge of their horrible website next. But I’m not optimistic.

More data is usually available. It takes time or money, but you can get more data.
But you’re probably not using all the data you’ve already got.
I’m guessing what you meant was, “I wish I had more certainty.”
And that, unfortunately, isn’t available.

And it’s true that you shouldn’t ship work that’s hurried, sloppy or ungenerous.
But what’s actually on offer is something scrappy.

The irony of close competition,"The easiest way to get someone’s attention is to compare them to someone else.
When people compete on the same metrics (how many followers, how much income, how many points scored) the focus gets very tight. With a simple metric, there’s no confusion at all about how to earn more status.
The irony is that the simpler the metric, the less useful the effort is.
Big ideas, generous work, important breakthroughs–to pursue these goals is to abandon the metric of the moment in favor of a more useful sort of contribution.

Portion control,"That’s the two-part secret of smart eating–you don’t have to eat everything on your plate, and if you’ve got trouble with that, put less on the plate to begin with.
But the same rules apply in our daily lives. If a meeting is scheduled for an hour, you’re allowed to leave after ten minutes if you’re done.
The hard part isn’t ‘portion’, it’s ‘control’. Self-control is underrated.

Connection day,"Independence sometimes seems easier than the long-term, disciplined, generous work of connection.
But it’s connection that enables us to add value.
The math is simple: when people with different assets, needs and views come together, they’re able to produce more than they ever could on their own. Trading goods, skills and knowledge without friction creates a leap in productivity.

They don’t sign up.
They don’t engage.
They don’t spread the word.

Horizontal leadership,"The first week of business school was pretty miserable for me. I had no idea if the others were feeling as underwater as I was, because I was focused on my own challenges.
And then, a few days into the semester,Chip Conley, a fellow student, put a note in my campus mailbox. To paraphrase, “I’m organizing a five-person brainstorming group, and I’m hoping you can join us.”
Chip wasn’t in charge of anything. Like me, he was one of the youngest students in the class. But he realized that the best way forward was together, so he reached out and changed the lives of four fellow travelers. By assembling a few others, he created magic, possibility and connection.

Politics vs. governance,"“It’s just politics.”
No one ever says, “it’s just governance.”
Politics is organized sparring about power, without much regard for efficacy or right or wrong.
Governance is the serious business of taking responsibility for leadership.
Over the last twenty years, the mass media has shifted, from “here’s the news,” to, “hey, it’s just media.” As a result, a system has been built in which situations, emergencies and bad news have been packaged and promoted twenty-four hours a day.
In the face of that maelstrom of noise, it’s easy to come to the conclusion that the world is more dangerous and unstable than it has ever been.
When we have a chance to speak up for governance, we can strike a blow against politics.
Because even though it doesn’t make compelling TV, the long-term challenges ahead of us aren’t going to respond to politics.
Dedication, resilience and concerted effort have saved us before and they can save us again. Except once again, it’s on us to speak up and do something about it.","August 29, 2019","Politics, Governance, Media"
Lottery logic,"Someone has to win the lottery, it might as well be you.
Buying a lottery ticket is economically irrational and emotionally rewarding for some. Because while someone has to win, it’s probably not going to be you.
There are examples of lottery logic in our daily work as well. It’s clear that someone is going to be the next Taylor Swift, the next George Clooney or the next Will Smith. But it’s probably not going to be you. Someone is going to raise a $40 million seed round, or get picked to be the next big thing. But it’s probably not going to be you.
It’s tempting to decide to follow the path that leads to mass-market stardom, the top of the charts, the fame and fortune that comes to the person who wins a media lottery. It’s tempting to build a mass-market podcast or a general-audience news site. It’s tempting to be the sort of vanilla-but-attractive actor who can play just about any role…
But it’s far more productive to focus on stepwise progress for thesmallest viable audienceinstead. It might not make headlines, but it’s far more likely to work and more rewarding in the long run.","August 28, 2019","Lottery logic, mass-market, niche audience"
Arithmetic true,"Arithmetic is true. It’s true because
1. we accept the terms for what they mean
2. it’s timeless, past and present and future are the same
3. it’s testable
In every fourth-grade classroom, the statement, “9 is bigger than 7” is clearly true. We can count out nine marbles. We have a mutual understanding of what “bigger” means in this context. From this shared understanding of the axioms and vocabulary, we can build useful and complex outcomes.
On the other hand, “Cheryl is a better candidate than Tracy” might be true for some people, but it presents all sorts of trouble if we look at it through the same lens of “truth” as a term we learned in arithmetic. We know who Cheryl is and we know who Tracy is, but it’s not clear what “better” means in this case. Are we describing who will win an election in two weeks? That’s awfully hard to test in advance.
And ‘words as building blocks of truth’ gets even more complicated when the ideas intersect with both science and culture. The statement, “The theory of evolution is our best explanation for how we all got here,” is demonstrably true in the realm of science, but for people with a certain worldview who value cultural alignment more than verifiable and testable evidence, this statement isn’t true at all.
The words matter. It matters whether we’re talking about ‘arithmetic true’ or simply an accurate description of what works for part of our culture.","August 27, 2019","truth, arithmetic, cultural perspective"

Actually, that’s selling your potential short.
Even if the chip shot went in the hole, it doesn’t mean you hit the ball properly.
It might simply have been a positive variance. Next time, it could easily bounce the other way.
In order to improve our performance, we need to model our preparation, our effort and our form against a standard, not base it on the outcome. Because outcomes aren’t always guaranteed by our work.

What does it feel like when you say “later”?,"What does it sound like when you put something off?
All of us have a catalog of voices in our head. We’ve got the one for feeling behind, the one for not feeling good enough, the one we use when we’re trying to avoid a sore spot.
There are good reasons to decide to wait until later.
Waiting for later keeps our options open.
Waiting for later helps us avoid the short-term hustle.
Waiting for later feels safer.
Too often, waiting for later also keeps us from leaping, from leading and from making a difference. It keeps us from moving on, moving forward.
The feeling of “later” doesn’t go away. it actually gets harder and harder to leap as the time goes by.
It’s easy to turn waiting for later into a habit. It’s a great way to hide from the work we truly care about, especially if it’s uncomfortable.
Today’s the last day of 2019 to apply for thealtMBA.
It’s possible that you’ve heard about it, read thecase studies, seen the impact it’s made on the thousands of people who have completed it, but perhaps you decided to wait until later.

Rand Fishkin shares a thoughtfulanalysisabout a trend that now affects just about everyone: Google is hoarding more and more traffic.
When I worked at Yahoo, there were 183 links on our home page. The stated strategy of the company was to build more and more internal content and services (Yahoo mail, Yahooligans, Yahoo Finance) to keep as many surfers on their site for as long as they could. The math was simple: if you’re getting paid by the impression, having someone stay for twenty or thirty clicks is way more profitable than encouraging them to leave and go to another site.
Google blew this status quo wide open. Their model was very different: “come here on your way to somewhere else.”  There were only two links on their home page, because the only place they wanted to encourage you to go was wherever a good search led you.
If you were a company or an individual with something to say, this hub and spoke model was essential to your ability to make a difference online. The web is a very big haystack, but if your needle was sharp enough, the promise was that you could get found.
And if you were someone looking for information, commerce or connection, you could rely on Google to take you there.
This, as much as anything, enabled Google to draw huge amounts of traffic away from Yahoo. It didn’t take very long for surfers to realize that they wanted to see what else was out there, not be shunted around a walled garden.
Year after year, driven by the short-term (shortsighted) demands of the public markets, Google has been losing its way on this effective (and community-based) strategy. In the most recent data Rand quoted, we see that more than half the time, a search on Google leads to someone either clicking on nothing (because they found what they needed without leaving the search results) or visiting a property Google already owns.
On a regular basis, Google makes changes to their UI and algorithm that destroy companies or industries in order to keep more time and clicks from the person who was expecting to find themselves somewhere else after visiting Google.
If you’re a fan of the open web, this is bad news.
If you’re an individual or business that’s hoping to be ‘found’ via a search, this is bad news.
And if you’re a Google employee or shareholder this is bad news as well, because monopoly is a tempting place to extract cash and drive the stock up, but it’s not stable.
The resilience of the connected open web is one of the shining lights of our modern culture, and my hope is that we can avert lock-in before we calcify around the current status quo.

Ask a busy person,"You might know one.
The busy person has a bias for action, the ability to ship, and a willingness to contribute more than is required. The busy person is wrong more than most people (if you get up to bat more often, you’re going to have more hits and more strike outs, right?). Those errors are dwarfed by the impact they create.

Often, we make the mistake of focusing on too broad an audience. Obsessing about the minimum viable audience forces us to make something that’s truly better. But once we identify those we seek to serve, broadening access is a powerful way to add impact.

Make a habit/break a habit,"If you’re trying to help yourself (or those you serve), the most effective thing you can do is create long-term habits. They become unseen foundations of who we will become.
The goal of running a marathon in six weeks is audacious, but it’s not a habit. You might succeed, but with all that pressure, it’s more likely you’ll simply abandon the project.
On the other hand, the goal of running to the mailbox (at least) and back for 50 days in a row is the sort of habit that might stick.
The same goes for education (“we do flashcards every day” is very different from “I need to cram to learn quantum mechanics for the test.”)
And it goes double for our lifestyles. If you can replace a bad habit with a good one, you’ll live with the benefits for decades.
The challenge is to set up systems that are likely to create habits, not sprints that lead to failure.",,"habits, long-term, lifestyle"
The anatomy of annoying,"Pema Chodron’s story has stuck with me for a decade: At a meditation retreat, the guy sitting near her kept making an annoying clicking sound. Again and again, she was jolted from her practice because he kept clicking his tongue.
During the break, as she gathered up her courage to tell him that he was ruining the day for her and for everyone else, she realized that in fact, it was a nearby radiator that was causing the clicking.
Suddenly, the fact that it was an inanimate object changed everything for her.
It wasn’t about her any longer.
It wasn’t intentional or selfish.
It was simply a radiator.
The rest of the day was fine, because it was simply a radiator.
My biggest takeaway is that the key leap wasn’t in discovering that the sounds came from a radiator. The lesson is that acting like it comes from a radiator completely solves the problem.

Responsibility and the power of ‘could have’,"The us/them mindset of most corporate customer service is simple:
Which means that when things go wrong, you’ll likely encounter a legalistic mentality that begins and ends with, “it’s out of our control.”
There’s an alternative.
It begins with understanding the economics of loyalty. Saving a customer is ten times more efficient than finding a new one. If it costs an airline $1,000 of marketing and route development to acquire a first class business traveler, it’s worth at least $10,000 in customer service to keep one. And that means that an extra ten minutes on the phone clocks in at a high value indeed.
And it continues with a simple tactic: Instead of defining the minimal legal requirement, outline the maximum possible action you could have taken.
“You’re right ma’am, that was a terrible situation. And we could have alerted you in advance that the plane was late, and we could have trained the flight attendants to be more aware of situations like this and we could have been significantly more responsive when we saw that the whole thing was going sideways. That’s incredibly frustrating–you’re right.”
Because it’s all true. You could have done all of these things. And it’s true, it was frustrating. If it wasn’t, she wouldn’t have called.
And then, after learning all the things you could have done, send the ideas upstream. It’s free advice, but it’s good advice.
Because the race doesn’t go to organizations that do the minimal legal requirement. The race goes to those that figure out what they could do. And do it.","August 17, 2019","Responsibility, Customer Service, Loyalty"

The never-ending ratchet of conspicuous consumption,"It used to be that a well-tended lawn of 50 by 100 feet was wasteful indeed. Today, it’s in the by-laws of the local housing association. You could impress the neighbors with a new Cadillac, now you not only need a Tesla, but you need a new Tesla. And you could show off by flying first class, but then you needed to charter a plane, then charter a jet, then charter a bigger jet, then buy a fractional share, then own the whole thing, then get a bigger one and on and on.
Conspicuous consumption is not absolute, it’s relative.
It’s sort of a selfish potlatch, in which each person seeks to demonstrate status, at whatever the personal or societal cost, by out-consuming the others.
Social networks have amplified this desire, at the same time they simplified the execution. Now you can waste time and dignity instead of money. Who can you tear down? How much time can you waste? What’s it worth to you to have more followers than the others?
It’s a lousy game, because if you lose, you lose, and if you win, you also lose.

Earning trust outperforms earning envy.","August 14, 2019","Conspicuous consumption, status, social networks"
Innovation is guts plus generosity,"Guts, because it might not work.
And generosity, because guts without seeking to make things better is merely hustle.
The innovator shows up with something she knows might not work (pause for a second, and contrast that with everyone else, who has been trained to show up with a proven, verified, approved, deniable answer that will get them an A on the test).
If failure is not an option, then, most of the time, neither is success.
It’s pretty common for someone to claim that they’re innovative when actually, all they are is popular, profitable or successful. Nothing wrong with that. But it’s not innovative.
Allow generosity to take the lead and you’ll probably discover that it’s easier to find the guts.","August 13, 2019","Innovation, Guts, Generosity"
The downside of possibility,"Optimists are always a little disappointed.
If you live with possibility, the idea that things can get better, that with consistent generous effort you can make a contribution, then you also end up feeling just a bit let down that it didn’t happen this time.
The alternative is to insist on limits, to be a pessimist, to simply play it as written and only do your job, expecting the worst.
Sure, you could probably avoid a little disappointment that way, but how could it be worth the journey? What’s the point of all this risk, effort and connection if we’re not going to use it in search of better?","August 12, 2019","optimism, disappointment, possibility"

The old media/new media chasm,"In every era, traditional media channels will diminish, dismiss and ignore the new ones. They do this at the very same time that they are supplanted by the new ones.
While they will occasionally spend some time or money testing a new medium, they rarely leap.
This is the posture of the business people/publishers, but it also has an impact on their editorial approach.
Radio shows rarely became TV shows. TV networks didn’t embrace cable as they could have. The book industry generally ignores every innovation in tech.
As late as 1994, Bryant Gumbel was spending time on network TV beingbefuddledby the ‘internet’. And in 1999, Conde Nast bought the print half ofWiredbut intentionally left the web version behind.
Twenty years ago, newspapers were in a perfect position to establish blog networks—they had their reader’s attention and advertiser’s trust. But they blinked.
New media tends to be adopted by amateurs first. And it rarely has a mass audience in the early days (because it’s new). But professional content for the masses is precisely what old media stands for. As new media gains traction, the old media doubles down on what they believe to be their value, because they no longer have a monopoly on attention.
The editors at Encyclopedia Brittanica were proud of the control they had over every page, so they ignored Wikipedia. The producers and directors of movies love the gloss of film, so they ignored video games. And the editors of newspapers like their local hegemony so they fight against distributed content.
So theTimespublishesa snarky, poorly written takedown of podcasts. Not because it’s based on the economic or cultural reality of today, but because their self-esteem requires there to be a chasm between all of these amateur podcasts and the few professional ones that they deign to create and publish.
Businesses make their own choices and suffer the consequences. The Mutual Broadcasting Network was a powerhouse in radio, but no longer. The problem is that these media businesses also narrate our cultural conversation, and that narration is historically wrong and prevents people from seeing what’s possible until it’s already well underway.
There were thousands of newspapers before there were only a few profitable ones. There are millions of YouTube creators, but only hundreds make a great living at it. And the same will be true of podcasts.
But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t start a podcast. You should. Because a podcast is a generous way to share your ideas. Because it gives you a way to clarify your thinking. Because you can assemble a group of people who want to go where you’re going.

Streaks,"Today’s the 11th year in a row of daily posts on this blog. Nearly 5,000,000 words since my first post twenty years ago, and I haven’t missed a day (given some time-zone wiggle room) since 2008.
Streaks are their own reward.
Streaks create internal pressure that keeps streaks going.
Streaks require commitment at first, but then the commitment turns into a practice, and the practice into a habit.
Habits are much easier to maintain than commitments.
I’m pretty sure that the blog would still have an impact if I missed a day here or there, but once a commitment is made to a streak, the question shifts from, “should I blog tomorrow,” to, “what will tomorrow’s blog say?”
And once you’ve made that shift, it’s 100x easier to find the voice that you’re looking for.
I didn’t set out to have this particular streak (I don’t remember the day the blog went from ‘most days’ to ‘every day’) but I’m glad to have gone on this journey. Thanks for being part of it.

Impossible,"Our days are filled with the path to future skills, tasks and commitments that we believe we can’t possibly take on. We’ve seduced ourselves into believing that we’re not born with the talent, or that the obstacles to doing the work are just too great.
In fact, it’s more likely that we’ve simply decided that the work isn’t worth the effort.

Rules and responsibility,"“Use your best judgment.”
Bureaucracies have a very hard time saying this to their staff.
They create an endless series of scripts and rules, procedures that force people to not care. “I’m just doing my job,” which is the precise opposite of, “I see the problem and I’m going to fix it.”
As any organization hits a sufficient size, it will increase rules in order to decrease responsibility. Because they’ve gotten big enough that they no longer trust the people who work for them.

Fooled by reputation,"The second law of motion isn’t true because it was discovered by Isaac Newton, it’s simply true. Newton merely described it.
The fact that he spent most of his time doing alchemy and looking for magic doesn’t impact the truth of what he discovered.
There’s a chasm between science, where the identity of the discoverer doesn’t matter, and culture, where, “because he said so,” is a factor in our beliefs.
The reputation of a jazz musician, or a comedian or a political leader can influence whether or not we think the work is any good. And it can even cause us to change our mind once we discover something about its originator.","August 2, 2019","reputation, science, perception"
Living in surplus,"In our culture, it’s easy to choose to live in deficit.
To spend just a bit more than you make, so that you’re in debt.
To need to drive just a bit faster than the prevailing traffic, so you can push every interaction.
To measure yourself against someone (there’s always someone) who has more (there’s always more) than you do.
If this habit of becoming ‘behind’ is the fuel you need to do your best work, it’s difficult for an outsider to argue against.
But consider that it’s also possible to choose to live in surplus.
To spend a bit less than you make, so you’re never worried about paying the rent.
To drive with the flow of (metaphorical) traffic, because not only is it safer, it frees you up to dream.
And to measure yourself against no one but yourself. Raise your standards as often as you can, but not because someone else you chose out of the lineup of success is somehow ahead of you.
When you live in surplus, you can choose to produce because of generosity and wonder, not because you’re drowning.

Don’t buy cheap chocolate,"Halloween is a month away. And over the next few weeks, a lot of cheap chocolate is going to get bought in preparation for the ringing doorbell.
Cheap chocolate is made from beans picked by poor kids in dangerous conditions.
And cheap chocolate is made from beans that don’t even taste that good, but come from more hardy trees, so it’s more reliable to grow.
Some of thepoorest people in the worldraise cacao beans, and the market is driven by the low bidders. The low bidders are the folks who have no room for flexibility in their supply chain because the end product they sell is so price sensitive. For forty years, it’s been a race to the bottom, one that has led to plenty of ignored pain.
On the other hand, expensive chocolate turns the ratchet in the other direction. The folks who make the bars, particularly those who dodirect trade, keep paying higher and higher wages. They keep children out of the system. And they encourage their growers to use the tastier artisanal Criollo and Trinitario varieties, keeping them from extinction.

The race to the bottom,"Whenanyonehas the ability to announce breaking news, urgent updates, RIGHT NOW, steal attention and emergencies, then sooner or later, many will do just that.
Attention is scarce, scarcer than ever, and we’ve given everyone a machine that can steal attention, and a keyboard that can be used to steal even more.
The race for cheap, unearned attention is a race that can’t be won.As soon as someone gains the lead, someone else will lower their standards and take a shortcut to get even more. The players have already surrendered their self-esteem, so it’s simply an escalating hijack of trust. And so we have dark patterns, once-respected media outlets with shameless headlines and an entire industry based on clickbait, come-ons and trickery.
It’s pretty clear that there’s an alternative. A chance to work toward the top instead. To deliver anticipated, personal and relevant messages to people who want to get them.

A ratchet with leverage,"That’s something worth building.
Electricity is a ratchet with leverage. Once communities have access to a little electricity, a solar lantern, say, they quickly discover that they want/need more electricity. The productivity increases create more income which gives them more money to buy more electricity. The leverage that this productivity and income give them (combined with the actual power at their disposal) creates a one-way route toward the future.
The same thinking applies to a personal career.
The first speech you’ll give will be difficult. The tenth one will be easier. Each speech, well-delivered, creates more demand for more speeches. Each speech given gives you more leverage to give better speeches. Better speeches create more demand…
This is the opposite of shoplifting. Shoplifting isn’t a ratchet. The system actually pushes back harder and harder the more you do it. And it has no leverage.
Some businesses work at scale because they’re ratchets (they cause motion in one direction) and they’re able to reinvest from that ratchet to create more leverage. Amazon is certainly the most shining example of this simple process.
But it can also work for the local university. A little learning creates demand for more learning. Useful degrees as a label for effort offer leverage to those that receive them, and the demand for more learning and more leverage gives the university resources to expand and do it even more.
When in doubt, look for the ratchet and look for leverage.

Health is a marketing problem.
Climate change is a marketing problem.
Growing your organization, spreading the word, doing work you’re proud of–these aren’t engineering problems or economics problems.They’re marketing problems.
That’s because humans make choices. If we live in a culture where people are free to choose, we’ve offered control over our future to others.
When humans make choices–that’s marketing. Marketing is the difficult work of telling a story that resonates, of bringing a consistent set of promises to people who want to hear them.
If you want to change things, it helps to understand how humans make choices. And if you’ve got a change in mind, I hope you’ll spend the time and effort it takes to get better at bringing your story to the people who need to hear it.

The rip saw,"Supposedly, going against the grain is really difficult.
It turns out, though, that it’s far more dangerous to cut with a rip saw, a blade that goes along the grain. It often leads to a botched project. When you’re cutting across the grain, you know exactly what to expect and won’t get surprised by a patch of resistance you didn’t expect.

There are high power lines.

It turns out, apparently, that a swinging chainsaw is far safer than having men and women climbing through trees with ropes and saws. We don’t notice someone falling out of a tree and breaking an arm (or worse) because it doesn’t make good TV. And if you assign 100 people to go out into the dense forest and expose themselves to this risk, it doesn’t feel nearly as fraught as the crazy helicopteroption, even if it turns out to be safer.
Often, that’s our instinct. To pay the persistent, consistent, significant price of deniable small dangers and avoid even the feeling of the big loss, even if it’s actually less dangerous.

“I know it’s bad – but everyone’s doing it”,"The optimists who got excited about the ‘everyone has a microphone’ promise of the Net 20 years ago overlooked two flaws in human nature:
First, given sufficient reward (money, attention, fame, notoriety) some people will show up and say and do things that they know are wrong.
Second, if enough people are in the first group of bottom fishers, many other people may decide that those behaviors aren’t as wrong as they thought they were. The internet ends up normalizing bad behavior, because bad behavior captures our attention and gets noticed. We multiply the outliers in our imagination and come to the erroneous conclusion that their behavior is common, when it actually isn’t.
There are two ways forward, and both are up to us: First, we can start paying more attention (rewarding) good behavior. And second, we can start modeling precisely the sort of discourse and contributions we hope to see from others.
The best antidote to a culture shifting to bad behavior is to re-normalize good behavior.","September 20, 2019","bad behavior, normalization, good behavior"

Artists and freedom,"It’s tempting to claim the role of artist. Once you’re an artist, you’re free.
Free to work your own hours, free to make what you want to make, free to express yourself.
Except not really.
Because it comes with a hook. The hook of, “here, I made this.”
Responsibility for the work.
It’s a privilege, and we trade our freedom for it. The responsibility to own what we make.","September 18, 2019","Artists, Freedom, Responsibility"
"If you’re lost, go faster","Going faster increases the chances that you’ll find a landmark and become unlost.
This rule has a corollary though:If you’re going the wrong direction, turn around.
[And one clarification: sometimes going faster looks a lot like going slower in the short run. Because taking the time to read a map, get your bearings and understand the system you’re in ultimately gets you there more quickly.]

The relationship with the customer,"If you’ve ever bought a mattress online, or a private label product from Amazon, you’ve experienced the value created by the last step.
That mattress company didn’t make the mattress.
And Amazon doesn’t make light bulbs.
There are countless factories vying to sell generic products to the companies that own the customer relationship. Perhaps 90% (sometimes 100%) of the profit goes to companies that make the sale, not the ones who actually made the product.
That’s because while they make the thing, they don’t do the work. The hard part is earning attention and trust. The hard part is helping someone make the choice. (There’s a difference between the hard part and the important part. Without the factory, there’s nothing to sell. Making it is important. But increasingly, it’s not the hard part.)
The Broadway producer makes a profit, the chorus member ekes out a living. Fair pay is related to the scarce work of engaging with the customer.
Either you’re doing the hard part or you’re left out of the transaction.","September 16, 2019","customer relationship, profit distribution, engagement"
Placebo blindness,"You can go to work offended by the idea that you might traffic in placebos. You can be certain that your aromatherapy, jewelry store, engineering consulting, stereo gear or home improvement practice is 100% performance-based, completely driven by specs, immune to a double-blind study.
Or, you can embrace the fact that human beings are 94% irrational, making decisions based on feelings, expectations and culture. That none of us are double-blind in real life. That theplacebois the most highly leveraged and efficient way you’ve got to help people get to where they’re going.
Ignoring the placebo effect won’t make it go away. Embracing it will help you do much better work, work that quite possibly is based on those skills and practices you’ve worked so hard to be good at. If it’s worth doing your work, it’s worth doing it in a way where placebos will help you do it better.","September 15, 2019","Placebo effect, irrational decision-making, performance-based practices"
More (or less),"The linchpin faces a fork in the road:
You can try to make your job have more. More impact, more responsibility, more leverage.

A useful definition of art,"Art is a human activity. It is the creation of something new, something that might not work, something that causes a viewer to be influenced.
Art uses context and culture to send a message. Instead of only a contribution of beauty or craft, art addsintent. The artist works to create something generous, something that will change us.

Approaching the limits,"Not the limit of our skills.
Not the limit of our knowledge.
Not the limit of our physical capacity…
It’s almost always the limits of our internal narrative. Our guts. Our willingness to be kind, to believe, to care enough to leap.
We can’t do anything about the limitations of physics, and we can never do enough to change the limitations of our culture. But we can begin today on changing the internal limits we place on ourselves.

Memories of memories,"That’s most of what we’ve got.
We don’t actually remember much of what happens. Instead, we get what we’ve rehearsed.
If we fail to rehearse, the memory will fade.

The wind at your back,"Tactics are great. Execution is essential.
But a smart strategy is like having the wind at your back. It makes everything easier.
Once we dig in on our tactics and invest in execution, it gets emotionally difficult to walk away even (especially) if our strategy is working against us.
Nearly every time I’ve changed my strategy, I’ve regretted how long it took me to realize that it was time to do so. So much time and energy wasted. You can get a lot more done when you’re working with the environment instead of against it.
Today’s the launch day forThe Bootstrapper’s Workshop.It’s a strategic check-up for anyone who wants to build a business without raising a bucketful of money. Get the strategy right and you’ll have an easier time with the tactics.

Being stuck is reasonable,"That’s precisely why you’re stuck. Every decision you’ve made, all the status quo you’re holding on to, the fears you have–they’re all reasonable. This is a mature, apparently safe series of choices. Congratulation on being wise and careful.
The only way to get out of the spot you’re in is to do something that feelsunreasonable, that’s unreasonable in the short term, that a similar person in a similar situation would say is unreasonable.
Because if that wasn’t the case, then you wouldn’t be stuck, would you?
If you truly want to get unstuck, if you want to move to higher ground or do something more worthwhile, the first question to ask is, “Am I willing to be unreasonable, at least for a while?”","September 9, 2019","stuck, unreasonable, change"
On becoming an acquired taste,"People say that as if there’s something wrong with it.
In fact, once you become an acquired taste, then those that have done the hard work to like what you make are likely to talk about it, likely to come back for more, likely to insist on paying more for something that’s not simply a pedestrian pleasure, available on every corner, merely pandering for a bit more attention.
It takes guts to create a contribution to culture that’s more than simply a checklist item. And then you have an asset, one that people with voices that are fungible never do.","September 8, 2019","acquired taste, culture, authenticity"
One of the above,"The easiest way to win a poll,riga plebiscite or generally end up as number one is to have the competing votes split among many similar competitors.
Bob Marley was a magical artist, but one reason he’s such a seminal figure is that most of the other musicians of his time (in the North American market) were lumped together in one or two other categories, whereas he was pioneering a new one. You might not want to play reggae at your party, but if you did, you were going to play Marley.
In order to be “one of the above” you have to begin by being willing to be “none of the above.” To zig with intent, when the market is insisting that you zag.
There’s a caveat, though: In order to be one of the above, you need to be in the jukebox or on the ballot. And that means your innovation, while different, still has to qualify for consideration.","September 7, 2019","innovation, competition, uniqueness"
Two kinds of 9 to 5 job,"The eight-hour workday is precious and humane, and difficult to find in an era of always-on communication.
But there are two kinds of 9 to 5 jobs.
The first one is the industrialized cog. Protect yourself, do as little as you can, because the boss will always take more. This is the standard, and the source of the expression about watching the clock.
The other one is thelinchpin. This is the contributor who brings so much emotional energy, thoughtfulness, risk-taking and passion to the job that they leave nothing in reserve. Eight hours of this sort of work is a choice, and it’s a privilege if you care about the work you’re doing. It’s also plenty. It’s plenty because of instead of ‘more’, you went for ‘deeper.’
When we see passionate people at work (at a chess tournament, a brainstorming session, writing a play or counseling), we have trouble imagining doing it for six hours in a row, never mind eight.
It’s no wonder hours have been expanding. If we’re coasting through our day, it’s the only way for the imagination-challenged boss to create more productivity. More low-value hours for no more pay. More hours is the only option if you’re not willing to put your heart into it.
The alternative is to figure out how to go all in, to make a ruckus and then to stand back and catch your breath.
If you’re lucky enough to have the choice, it’s worth seeing that you have the choice.","September 6, 2019","9 to 5 jobs, work culture, passion"

The end of reputation,"AI can now easily (8 seconds) change theidentityof someone in a film or video.
Multiple services can now scan a few hours of someone’s voice and thenfakeany sentence in that person’s voice.
Open publishing on platforms like the Kindle means that there’s no gatekeeper to verify the source of what you read. Perhaps there’s already a fake Kindle book by “Malcolm Godin” and “Seth Gladwell”. I wonder if it’s any good or if someone simply wanted to fool a search engine?
Don’t buy anything from anyone who calls you on the phone. Careful with yourprescriptions. Don’t believe a video or a photo and especially areview. Luxury goodsprobablyaren’t. Thatfishmight not even be what it says it is.
But we need reputation. The people who are sowing the seeds of distrust almost certainly don’t have your best interests in mind–we’ve all been hacked. Which means that a reshuffling is imminent, one that restores confidence so we can be sure we’re seeing what we think we’re seeing. But it’s not going to happen tomorrow, so now, more than ever, it seems like we have to assume we’re being conned.

What do you own?,"Small business is a resilient backbone of the modern world. Choosing to not simply be the day laborer or the gig worker, but someone who actually owns something.
You might own a permission asset–the right people, offering you their attention and trust. You might own a lease or a patent or some other form of property. And you might own a reputation, one that earns you better projects and a bigger say in what happens next.
As we begin a new season, it’s worth considering what you own, and far more usefully, what you can build on your way to owning even more leverage. If we are all shopkeepers, what do you have in inventory? If you own nothing but the next eight hours of your time, for sale to the highest bidder, you may be disappointed in the bids you get.
I just got a note from an Akimbo workshop participant. She said, “Today I got my first project where I will be getting not an hourly rate but an equity stake in the product. I’m doing the happy dance and thanking Freelancer’s Workshop.”

And then we stop seeing the world,"It’s possible (not easy, but possible) to be a dispassionate observer. To have a sense of what the market wants, of what’s likely to work, of what quality looks and feels like.
But not when it’sourwork.
When it’s your work, the moment you commit to it and own the outcome, you can’t help it. None of us can. We start to shave/bend/ignore the truth.
Some make a mistake by downgrading the work, lowering expectations and trash-talking the output of all that hard work. Probably to protect ourselves from the doom that we fear is right around the corner. This makes every criticism nothing but confirmation of what we say we already knew.
And some make the mistake of persuading themselves that their taste is universal, their talent is off the charts and that their effort is greater than anyone else’s. And so every criticism is seen as a personal attack.
The reality is nothing like this.
The reality is somewhere in between.
And it’s worth developing the skill and guts to see it.","September 2, 2019","self-awareness, criticism, perspective"
This one simple trick makes everything faster and easier,"Here it is, tested, effective and worthwhile:
Stop chasing shortcuts.
Personal finance, weight loss, marketing, careers, beating traffic, relationships, education–everything that matters to someone often comes with heavily promoted shortcuts as an alternative.
Fast, risk-free, effortless secrets that magically work, often at someone else’s expense.
But if the shortcuts worked as promised, they wouldn’t be shortcuts, would they? They’d be the standard.
A shortcut is not an innovation. It’s not a direct path, either. Those work, but they require effort, risk and insight.
If you can’t afford the time and effort to do it right, you probably can’t afford to do it over after you realize that the shortcut was merely a trap.","September 1, 2019","shortcuts, personal finance, effort"
Which change?,"You can change the way people get the things they want.
Or you can changewhatthey want.
Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates are two of the wealthiest people in history. They got that way by changing how people used tools to find new ways to get what they already wanted.
Nelson Mandela and Jacqueline Novogratz picked a different mission. Trying to change what people want in the first place.
Both paths are available, but they’re different.

Bread and books,"Twenty years ago, I met the most famous baker in the world.
I was in Paris for a speech, and visited Poilane, a bakery much smaller than its reputation would lead you to believe. I was hoping to take home an unbaked kilo of dough, a sourdough, one that I could use to spawn hundreds of new loaves over the years.
Proud of my sneakiness, I began by ordering $30 worth of loaves and tarts. And then, offhandedly said, “and an unbaked loaf please.”
The clerks would have none of this. It was impossible, it wasn’t done, it wasn’t permitted.
Bluffing, I said, “I’m confident that M. Poilane would be okay with it.”
On cue, a door behind the counter opened and a handsome man, dressed in a smock, came out to introduce himself. Even before he spoke, I could see the sparkle in his smile, and I figured we would hit it off.
Instead of shooing me away, he invited me into his office. We spent two or three hours together that day, talking about his work. He showed me his huge library on the history of bread and we hung out in the basement, where it was over 100 degrees because of the wood-burning ovens. He sent me home with 2 kilos of unbaked dough. I kept that starter alive for years.
Lionel understood that bread shared wasn’t bread lost. That no one was going to be able to steal his sourdough, even if they grew their own version at home. Over several years, he and I got together for long lunches in Paris when I was in town for a speech. I taught him about the internet, and he taught me about the magical intersection between generosity and idiosyncracy.
Ideas, bread and books are all the same–they’re better when they’re shared. The posture of generosity and connection replaces a mindset of scarcity, and Lionel modeled this philosophy every day.
When he and his wife werekilledin a tragic helicopter crash, he left behind friends all over the world as well as two teenaged daughters. I honored his memory in the best way I could think of–by dedicating a book to him. My challenge was that I didn’t have a book in the works, nor was I planning to write one.
The book I wrote, so that I could have a book to dedicate to Lionel, wasPurple Cow. It captured his energy and his care and his impact on so many. And it changed the arc of my career as a writer as well.
Lionel’s eldest daughter, Apollonia, immediately stepped up and took over the bakery, a task that few outsiders felt she could handle. After all, she was only a kid. And the patriarchal mindset in her industry and city didn’t help.
Not only has the quality of the bakery been maintained, but its impact has only grown. Apollonia has modeled the clarity and contribution of her dad, and has shown us what it means to share ideas and to lead. From the first moment, she showed up in a way that honored the memory of her parents.
Generosity, abundance and idiosyncrasy in service of craft and community.

“Get what you want without compromise”,"That’s the call of our times.
Run a marathon without getting tired.
Lose weight without dieting.
Get ahead without working hard.
Earn big money without risk…
When you expose it this clearly, it’s obviously nonsense. Compromise is precisely what’s called for.
You can’t have everything you want. But, if you care enough and trade enough and work hard enough, you might be able to get some things that matter.
The real question might not be, “what do you want,” it might be, “what do you care enough to compromise for?”

On quitting a freelance gig,"A powerful thing a freelancer can do for her career is to figure out when to fire the bad clients. Firing bad clients is an essential step on the way to finding better ones.
Identifying a client mismatch:
Quitting in a huff rarely changes the approach a client takes. Instead, it’s the erosion of esteem and resources that eventually help them wake up. They don’t have to be fired with drama. In fact, everyone wins when you hand off a mismatched client to someone who can do a better job than you can in dealing with their needs and approaches.
Freelancers need to worry about doing the right thing as well as maintaining their reputation. Leaving a project in midstream hurts your reputation, and your promise needs to mean something. But sometimes we express our fear of change by sticking around longer than we need to and longer than we promised to.
The magic of freelancing is that projects end but careers persist. If you can walk away from a project at an end point, it probably moves your career forward more smoothly than if you develop the habit of quitting in the middle.
A few questions to consider as you think this through:
One last thought: The best time to think through questions about ending a gig is before you take the gig. Having a set of principles makes it far easier to handle the pressures and grind of the hardest days of your work, because you’re making strategic choices, not decisions under duress.
We talk more about thishere.","October 28, 2019","freelancing, client management, career growth"
“Where does this bus go?”,"One approach, which is tempting in the short run, is to wait until people are on the bus and then ask each person where they want to go. Seek to build consensus. Try not to leave anyone out.
The other approach, which works far better if you have a fleet of available buses, is to announce in advance where the bus is going. That way, anyone who wants to go where you’re headed can get onboard.
Enrollment is critical. Enrollment allows leaders to lead. Not by endlessly querying those that they seek to serve, but by announcing their destination and then heading there, with all deliberate speed.","October 27, 2019","bus, enrollment, leadership"
Short and funny,"If we only forward the easy, short and funny things we read online, why are we surprised that our inbox is filled with nothing we’ll remember tomorrow?
What would happened if instead, we shared the most complex, useful and thoughtful things we discovered instead?","October 26, 2019","Inbox, Sharing, Complexity"
“What’s the hard part?”,"A simple question, often overlooked, as if ignoring it will make the problem go away.
Everything worth doing has a hard part. If it didn’t, it would have been done already.
The hard part, we can hope, will become easier if you allocate resources and focus and effort. That’s the point of the work, to whittle away at the hard part.
But, if we refuse to ask and answer, then how can we possibly focus on what matters?
It’s often a lot more fun and relaxing to focus on the parts that aren’t hard. Or to pretend that the hard part is easy.
Better, I think, if we’ve decided that the work is worth doing, to get serious about the parts that are worth our effort.","October 25, 2019","hard part, focus, effort"
All or nothing,"Projects often require tools. The right tool gets the job done (all of it) and an inferior one leaves it undone (none of it).
There’s a spectrum of cost, though. Tools require different levels of expense to purchase and use. If you use a cheap tool, you might end up with nothing. Use the right tool, and you get the desired result.
Because the cost of tools usually fills out a linear scale from cheap to expensive, we can be lulled into believing that the results are also on a linear scale. But that’s not true.
You’ll need to spend enough to get anything at all. Less than that is a total waste of time and money.
Better to use a tool that cost more than you expected than to use a cheap tool and get nothing in return.

Two buttons on offer,"Every person in your organization needs to wear a button.
And they can choose one of two. The choice is up to them, but they have to own it.
One button says, “I don’t care.”
The other button says, “I’d like to help.”
It’s entirely possible that you’ve managed your way into a bureaucracy that acts like it’s wearing the first button. If that’s true, admit it and have you and your team put on the buttons. You’ll save a lot of heartache by telling us and your co-workers the truth.
On the other hand, if you want the satisfaction that comes from wearing the second button, you’ve got to keep the promise.","October 23, 2019","buttons, choice, engagement"
Up and to the right,"The typical performance chart has two axes. And one is time. We can’t do anything at all about time, so there’s really one axis.
How fast did your profits grow?
How many followers did you add to your account?
How much muscle did you add to your calves?
The problem with a graph that only has one axis is that it’s dumb. No room for nuance. It’s a blunt instrument, easy to game.
If you want your profits to go up faster, simply cut corners. If you want more followers, buy them, or lower your standards, or pick a fight. And if you want to add muscle faster, sacrifice your health…
Adults are better off realizing that we have the patience and intelligence to measure our lives on two or more axes. Which means that instead of just one quadrant, there are four. That maybe it makes sense to choose to pursue something longer term, more resilient, more important.
That maybe the metric that was chosen for everyone isn’t really the metric you care about it.

The simple dynamics of failing retail,"The local retailer says, “I’m sitting here all day, with a limited selection and a paid staff, waiting for you to come and buy something I have in inventory. I’m paying rent, just waiting for you to come in, try things on and pay for them.”
The online retailer says, “I can use the same size staff to serve a town of a million, not a few thousand. I have a much bigger inventory, of course, but my rent and my staffing costs are tiny. And so what I sell you costs a lot less.”
The local retailer depended on two groups of people: Folks who needed or wanted the hands-on service, the ability to try things on and the chance to chat. And, people who didn’t demand those things but had no choice because there were no other options.
When online showed up, the second group defected. And with just the first group remaining, most local retailers are doomed.
The answer isn’t to figure out how to be as cheap as Amazon… you can’t. The answer is to figure out how to find the people (and the products and services they demand) so you can eagerly and comfortably charge a fair price.","October 20, 2019","retail dynamics, online vs local retailers, customer preferences"
‘Not good enough’ is an easy place to hide,"Sniffing at the others who care is a form of virtue signalling. It’s also an ineffective way to create real change.
“My Prius Hybrid gets 140 miles per gallon.”
“My Tesla is solar powered.”
“Really, well I take an electric scooter.”
“We carpool by sharing a horse.”
“A horse? You should walk!”
This misses the real problem: The 1998 Chevy Suburban, with just one person on board, doing a forty-mile commute at 12 miles per gallon.
The same goes for ranking elected officials on who is the most perfect on the issue we care about.
The people who are paying attention are the ones who are trying. And shaming people who are trying because they’re not perfect is a terrific way to discourage them from trying. On the other hand, the core of every system is filled with the status quo, a status quo that isn’t even paying attention.
Focusing the group’s energy on shutting down strip-mined coal is going to make far more impact than scolding the few who are trying.","October 19, 2019","virtue signalling, real change, discouragement"

Hope for the best,"Better, I think, to spec for the best instead.

Freelancing is a brave act,"When I quit my job in 1986 and went out on my own, it was shortly after my picture had appeared in a small feature in a national magazine. My grandmother proudly kept a copy of the magazine (not the article, the entire magazine) on her coffee table, proudly telling anyone who stopped by that her grandson was now a “FREE lancer.” Not sure what that meant, she had a hunch that it wasn’t nearly as stable, easy or prestigious as having an actual job.
Freelancers show up in the world without a safety net, offering to do their best. Freelancers rarely get the credit they deserve for the work they do.
Freelancers aren’t always sure of what’s next, and freelancers often get the wrong end of the stick.
But it’s about a pure a craft as most of us can find. You’re your own boss, most of the time, and figuring out a way to become better at being the boss of you is a worthwhile investment of effort.
I’m so pleased with the results we’ve achieved withThe Freelancer’s Workshop.It’s a straightforward approach to the biggest problem most freelancers have:Finding better clients.
Ournew sessionbegins signups today, and I hope you’ll check it out (click to find the disappearing purple circle discount). It’s the last session of 2019.
Better clientsdemand more, pay more and talk about your work.Better clientsmake it easier for you to level up, andbetter clientschallenge you to dig deeper and do what you’re capable of.
You don’t do better by working more hours. You can’t work more hours. You do better by finding better clients.
I’m delighted that so many freelancers read this blog, and proud to be, on my best days, a freelancer.
Join me at 1 pm ET today, Tuesday to talk about freelancing and how to level up. I’ll be taking your questions on myFBandInstapages.

“This is mediocre”,"Large organizations seek to decrease variability.
Starbucks wants the very best latte you buy from them to be exactly the same as the worst one.
If you define a spec and work hard to meet it, you can make it so that most things are within a reasonable distance of that spec. Which means that most of what you make is average.
If an entire industry is busy seeking to meet that average, we can define that work as mediocre. Not horrible, but certainly not exceptional (because ‘exception’ -al is self-explanatory).
When you go out to buy aluminum siding, copywriting or consulting services, you have a choice: You can demand that the work meets the industry spec, a fair product at a fair price. Or, you can seek something better than average, something worth paying extra for.
Most TV ads, most car services, most airplane flights–they’re mediocre. That’s a choice.
If you want to buy creative work that’s exceptional, you’ll need to pay for it (and accept the risk that it might not work out as planned).","October 14, 2019","mediocrity, exceptionalism, industry standards"
Open the cookies,"Put a bag of cookies in the break room and it might sit for days.
Open the bag and leave it out, and within an hour, all the cookies will be gone.
We are happy to take a tiny slice off the thing that’s being shared, but we hesitate to open the bag.
The same is true with all of the initiatives in our culture. Design, movements and ideas are all trapped, waiting to be opened, and then the rest of us will happily pile on.

“I’m sorry” takes guts,"I recently saw two men arguing about who got to use the urinal next.
As a result, neither got what he wanted, and neither could honestly say that his day got better.
The need to win every interaction, the inability to apologize, the short-term over the long-term–this isn’t a sign of strength, it’s a symptom of immaturity and weakness that almost always leads to suboptimal results.
If apologizing engages the network and makes it more likely that we can stay in sync, it pays for itself many times over.","October 12, 2019","apology, maturity, relationships"
Better than it needs to be,"Every element of the organization has a spec, a minimum required performance. Accounting has standards, so does the department that measures the air quality.
Everything beyond spec is marketing.
That’s an interesting definition, but I think it’s true: All the money, effort and time that an organization puts into making anything better than it has to be is a marketing expense.
Because the extra is there to help change minds, to spread the word, to earn trust and loyalty.
The head of marketing is the person in charge of what’s extra. Because if you want to grow, nothing is actually extra. It’s simply an investment.","October 11, 2019","marketing, investment, organization"
Initiative,"The only way to get initiative is to take it. It’s never given.
And some people hesitate to take it, perhaps because they’re worried that we’ll somehow run out.
We’re not going to run out. It’s a self-renewing resource.
From an early age, most of us were taught to avoid it. Do your homework. Take out the trash. Wait to get picked. Wait to get called on. Become popular. Fit in. Maybe stand out, but just a little bit. Failure is far worse than not trying.
The alternative is to take some initiative. On behalf of those you seek to serve.
Go ahead, there’s plenty to go around.","October 10, 2019","initiative, self-renewing, empowerment"
Projects vs tasks,"Your job might be a series of tasks. Tasks are work where money is traded for time and effort. You put in a fixed amount of time, expending effort along the way, and you get paid. In the end, tasks are completed and it’s up to the boss to weave those tasks together into something useful.
The person at the front desk of a hotel is probably doing a task. So is the lineman working on a high power line. The easier a job is to get, the more likely it involves doing tasks.
The alternative is projects.
The way a project gets done is up to you. Your goal is to create an extraordinary outcome, not to perform the tasks. The work done is simply a means to an end. If you can figure out how to do less work or different work and still create project magic, that’s exactly what you should do.
The challenge is inowningthe project. To say, “I’m going to engage with this customer in a way that changes them from frustrated to loyal,” as opposed to saying, “I’m going to move this paper from here to there.”
Claim the project before you start the work.","October 9, 2019","Projects, Tasks, Ownership"
Use your best judgment,"I called the front desk early in the morning. “Where’s the gym located?”
It’s a big hotel. They have a thousand rooms, and they’re part of a chain. Still, I was surprised to hear typing. The person who answered was typing the question into their database and then proceeded to read me the answer.
It’s reasonable to assume that the hotel decided to save some money by consolidating all of their front desk work into one central location. And reasonable again to assume that instead of training people to give clear and helpful answers, simply instructed them in what to read.
Still…
I can’t imagine that’s a job you’d want to do. A job that would use any of your skills or care. A job you would look forward to doing.
The next step is to have voice recognition replace this pesky worker. After all, the best cog is no cog at all.
Our choice is profound, and more urgent every day: either do a job where your best judgment is required, or do a job where management will work hard to replace you with someone cheaper.
Race to the top, race to the bottom.
Either way, you might win. Up to you.

The Big Fish theory,"In all markets, the market leader gets an unfair advantage. That’s because casual and unsophisticated customers choose the leader because it feels easier and safer.
The strategy, then, is not to wish and dream of becoming a big fish.
The strategy is to pick a small enough pond.
By engaging with the smallest viable audience, you gain the reputation and trust you need to move to ever bigger audiences.","October 7, 2019","Market leader, Small audience, Trust building"
Narratives about modernity,"If we give an isolated community access to the internet, very quickly, the quality of life will improve. Time will be saved, research into proven solutions will produce value, and people will become connected to a larger population. Those connections will lead to productivity and learning.
And, then, soon thereafter, they will becomelesshappy.
Not because they’re worse off, but because the dominant media narratives that arrive exist to make them feel insufficient, inadequate or simply jealous at how green the grass is over there.

Security superstition/Security theater,"Security theateris a rule requiring you to take off your shoes when you get to the airport. It doesn’t actually catch anyone, it simply makes peoplefeelmore secure, and it allows those in charge to feel like they’re doing something. Mostly, it’s a demonstration of power and authority, not a practical measure.
Andsecurity superstitioninvolves putting security measures in place on a hunch, or because others are doing it.
This alert from a website run by Thomson Reuters manages to do both:

This is malpractice. No, it’s not a doctor giving you the wrong medicine, but it’s definitely someone who should know better making an error that will cost countless users a lot of time and money.
Long passwords work better than short ones. But impossible-to-remember passwords get written on post-its by people who haven’t yet realized that they need a password manager. Having people change their passwords often simply creates more post-its. Insisting on arcane rules is nothing but theater plus superstition.
The theater and the superstition compounds, creating mountains of cruft, layers and layers of misunderstood but accepted practices that waste our time and make our systems less secure, precisely the opposite of what’s intended.
Software runs our world. Building insecure, difficult to use and frustrating software and then forcing people to use it is easily avoided. But it requires leadership and insight, not mindless superstition.","October 5, 2019","Security theater, Superstition, Password management"
How much is that piece of paper in the window?,"Four years at MIT cost about $250,000 all in. Or, you could engage in more than 2,000 of their courses on theirsite, for free.
What’s the difference?
When you do education, you pay tuition, plus you pay with a focus on compliance. Traditional education requires that students trade in freedom of choice, coerced by tests and exams. And what do you get? You get an ‘A’ and you get a certificate.
The power of that certificate is extraordinary. Students (and their families) will go a lifetime in debt to get that paper. They’ll make choices about time and focus and geography for that paper, ignoring what’s ostensibly possible in exchange for the certainty of acquiring it.
Learning, on the other hand, is self-directed. Learning isn’t about changing our grade, it’s about changing the way we see the world. Learning is voluntary. Learning is always available, and it compounds, because once we’ve acquired it, we can use it again and again.
Many adults in the US read no more than a book a year. That’s because books aren’t assigned after you’ve got your paperwork done.
We’re surrounded by chances to learn, and yet, unless it’s sugarcoated or sold in the guise of earning a scarce credential, most of us would rather click on another link and swipe on another video instead.
The exception: People who have chosen to be high performers. Doctors, athletes, programmers and leaders who choose to make a ruckus understand that continuous learning is at the heart of what they’ll need to do.
“Will this be on the test?”is a question we learn from a young age. If you need to ask that before you encounter useful ideas, you’ve been trapped. It’s never been easier to level up, but the paper isn’t as important as we’ve been led to believe.","October 4, 2019","education, learning, certificates"
Getting to the truth,"Your anecdote isn’t true.
I know it happened. I know that your experience, your feelings, your outcomes are real. And they’re yours.
Statistics suffer when compared to anecdotes. Because your mileage may vary. Your interaction with the randomness of the world will never match up to what the statisticians tell us to expect. Because averages and correlations are never what we actually experience. We experience a tiny slice of it.
But, at the same time that the larger truth can’t be experienced, your anecdote can never represent the larger truth, because it’s yours. What happened to you will never happen to anyone else, not in quite the same way.
By relying on well-told stories, we ignore the real truth, the universal truth of how the world actually is.

Facing our fears,"That’s unlikely.
If I’m lucky, I can glance at them.
But just for a second or two.
Our fears burn so bright that if we truly face them, we think we might be blinded.
Of course, we may think we’re looking at our fears, dead on, but it’s more likely we’re just seeing a distraction, a shadow of what’s actually holding us back.

There’s no reason to think that this should be true.
Doing well on tests, paying attention to what’s being asked, being diligent in short-term error correction–these are three hallmarks of someone who is good at school.
None of these are important once you’re charged with charting a new path, with figuring out what to do next. In fact, they get in the way.

Better/worse,"When things get difficult, is your instinct to invest the effort to make it better, or to set a trap so it all gets worse?
Because if things get worse, well, then you won’t have to deal with them much longer.
And if things get worse, then you’re off the hook.
No longer your problem.
If we don’t trust ourselves with making it better, if it’s too fraught with risk or emotionally painful, it might feel easier and simpler to simply make it worse and walk away.
Investing in a system, a place, a relationship, a project–that’s a commitment. It puts you even more on the hook. That person who is right in front of you becomes more real and the problem becomes even more urgent.
And it might even be worth it.

Discontinuous thought,"The gap between mobile and desktop is:
[shift] ENTER
When one is typing on a laptop, the assumption is that you’ll keep going with your thought until you push ‘send’ or ‘publish’.
But on a smart phone, the enter keyisyour publish button. So your text, your Slack message, or your tweet happens as soon as you type a single sentence.
That’s good for platforms that want to deliver the endorphin hit of a mic drop, but not particularly helpful in sharing complex ideas. And the ideas that are worth sharing are the complex ones.

A chance for better,"Perfect is the enemy of good.
Of course it is.
But that simple sentence becomes more urgent when we realize that nothing (and no one) is perfect. How could it be?
And so, if your hero, your cause, your holiday, your background, your relationship… if it’s not perfect, does that mean you should hide it? Be ashamed of it? Be afraid of it?
We’re surrounded by injustice, and yesterday was even worse. It’s so easy to find things that are imperfect and criticize them or worse, shame them.
Better, I think, to find glimmers of good and seek to amplify them. Mistakes can be seen, errors can be improved upon, progress can be made. But only if we embrace the chance for good.

Knowing the answer before you ask the question,"The first rule of cross-examination at trial is that you never ask a question that you don’t already know the answer to.
Inquiry has a place. Inquiry in the pursuit of science, of discovery and of learning is essential. But inquiry almost never belongs in a presentation. That’s because the presentation exists to communicate what you already know, not to discover something new.
That’s why comedians try out their new material in small clubs.
That’s why you should try out your job interview answers long before you go on a job interview.
And that’s why you shouldn’t throw a steel ball at the window of the new truck you’re launching unless you’re really, really sure it’s not going to break.

Golf is an endless asymptotic journey toward elusive perfection.
Surfing, on the other hand, is about wayfinding. A surf park with a repeated wave might be useful for training, but it’s not surfing.

The uses of Kickstarter,"A friend reached out because she’s thinking of using Kickstarter to fund her new book. That conversation led to a discussion about what Kickstarter is actually good at and how to use it. It turns out that there are many options (and some misunderstanding as well).
The uses of Kickstarter:
To raise money you don’t have for a project that you’ll be able to build and then ship to your supporters and people who already know you and trust you.
To create a community for an art project that isn’t designed to be a profitable business.
To have a temporary online store (instead of something more permanent, like Shopify), where you can run a pop-up and then be done (and move on to the next thing). It’s an effective way to highlight the tension of go/no go.
To capture the energy and attention of large numbers of people who don’t know your work (this almost never ever works and is theworstof these reasons).*
To give your existing fans and followers an organized way to support you and to see it unfold in real-time.
To have a simple, structured place to put your idea. By limiting your options and giving you deniability, it makes it easier for some to move forward.
To give you a safe place to succeed as well as to not-succeed. There’s a limit on the time and money you can invest because of the structure of the platform.
Most of the time, for most projects, Kickstarter isn’t the answer to the question you’re asking. That’s because it could more accurately be calledKickfinisher–you build a following first, over time, and then Kickstarter is the moment in time that those followers show up for your work.

*Kickstarter is powerful when used as intended. But it’s not very good at creating ‘hits’. It turns out that while 17,000,000 users have, in total, funded 173,000 projects, that’s only about a third of the total. 290,000 projects haven’t succeeded in being funded at all. And only 400 projects raised more than a million dollars each.

Which signal?,"We have far more than five senses, and people communicate with us using many of them.
You can receive a message via visual inputs, sound, text, smell, taste, touch, temperature, pheromones, sub-sonic rumbling and/or subtle facial gestures. You can feel comforted or jostled, part of a trusted circle or all alone. You can absorb the confidence radiated by a professional or feel the insecurity in someone who is overwhelmed.

Words on paper were a magical interregnum, a low-cost, editable, permanent way to tell a story as completely as we could while limiting ourselves to nothing but a keyboard.

The Google tax,"Actually, there are two.
The first is the tax we each pay so that companies can bid against each other to buy traffic from Google. Because their revenue model is (cleverly) built on both direct marketing and an auction, they are able to keep a significant portion of the margin from many industries. They’ve become the internet’s landlord.
The difference between a successful business in New York and an unsuccessful one is just a few percentage points–the successful ones pay 95% of their profit to landlords, while the unsuccessful ones pay 105%.
It doesn’t matter if there are competitors to Google in search: the model of bidding for attention is so economically compelling (because attention is so scarce), that companies are going to be paying ever more to reach people in this way–or allow their competitors to do so.
The second is harder to see: Because Google has made it ever moredifficultfor sites to be found, previously successful businesses like Groupon, Travelocity and Hipmunk suffer. As a result, new web companies are significantly harder to fund and build. If you’re dependent on being found in a Google search, it’s probably worth rethinking your plan.
The open web (and search… particularly Google) has created huge benefits in access, competitiveness and selection for so many markets. At the same time, there are structural challenges that are making the future less commercially interesting in many ways.
Capitalism is an efficient system for surfacing and addressing the needs of consumers. But once it veers toward control over markets by a single entity, those benefits disappear.

Miles Davis knew that Kind of Blue was done. Any more takes and tweaks would have made it less, not more.

Far better to say, “this might work.”

Break the lecture,"In 1805, if you listened to music, you heard it live. Every time. Today, perhaps 1% of all the music we hear is live, if that.
In 1805, if you listened to a lecture for school or work, you heard it live. Every time. Today, that’s still true.
That’s crazy.
Ten years ago, Sal Khan pointed out that thanks to the internet, we should have students watching best-in-class lectures at home, after school… and doing their homework together, with teachers, during the day. (HT toAlison Kingwho wrote about this 26 years ago). That hasn’t happened yet, but it should.
If we’re going to persist in creating hyper-expensive live lectures for millions of people every day, perhaps it’s time to change the dynamic. Imagine that there’s an app (I’ll call it Backchannel) and that the lecturer or her assistant has a dashboard.
Every student already has a phone. Let’s put them to use.
The Backchannel app begins by blocking all other apps–by reporting student participation. If we’re going to do this expensive lecture process in real-time, at the very least you can stop checking Facebook.
Second, the lecturer can at any time ask for students to answer a simple question about what’s being discussed. If a lot of students can’t answer the question, time to slow down. On the other hand, the Backchannel app can also act as a tool for students to anonymously let the lecturer (and the system) know that they’re bored. It’s hard to embrace how obvious this is, and yet it doesn’t get done.
The app can show via the dashboard how active each student is, by percentage or even by name.
Questions can stream in from the app, so the lecturer can get a quick view of what needs to be covered.
Students can have a discussion with one another (no private chats, though) about the last few minutes of what was covered. It’s asynchronous and can lead to far more airtime for people who might not be brave enough to raise a hand.
And of course, just as the school is rating the students (that’s a core tenet of the education-industrial complex) the students can rate every lecture, every time. What a dramatic shift in power, in attention and in reporting.
If we ended up with a classroom where the lecturers were on their toes, where students were actively engaged at all times and where the interactions were far more in sync, wouldn’t that be worth the hassle of putting our devices to better use? We can build this and start using it right now, not someday.
If we insist on lectures being the way they’ve always been, which is a one-way recitation, then let’s simply have students watch best-in-class recordings instead of the wasteful act of recreating them live, every time. But if we’re going to do it live, then let’s actually do it live.","November 16, 2019","lecture, engagement, Backchannel"
Compared to what?,"Are today’s 50 richest billionaires happier than the 50 richest people who lived twenty years ago?
It’s unlikely.
And yet they control many times as much wealth.
If you take a date to the fanciest, most exclusive restaurant in Portland, you may find the satisfaction that comes from having done something exclusive. On the other hand, if you were at that very same restaurant in Los Angeles, it might feel like a disappointing compromise. Same food, different status.
A 440-foot yacht isn’t better than a 200-foot yacht, unless we’re measuring ‘better’ in terms of status. And of course, once someone has a 445-foot yacht, then the 440-foot model is a lot less attractive, isn’t it?
And that’s why status-seekers need limits.
The Citation X can fly at 711 miles an hour. And no matter how much you spend, you can’t buy a jet that will go 800 miles an hour. Because the laws of physics (combined with the laws on sonic booms) make it impossible with our current technology. As a result, the owner of a Citation X can find the satisfaction that he has reached the limit.
There are two dangers of measuring happiness along just one axis. The first is that you will be easily disappointed, because the unbalanced approach to maximizing a single variable increases the chance that you will end up behind.
And the second is that you might actually succeed in hitting a limit. And then where will you find your happiness?
We (everyone around us) come out ahead when we create positive externalities for people who are competing to win. When folks are seeking to compete on who can build the most libraries, endow the most scholarships, and yes, pay the most taxes, it leads to a positive cycle of better. And we challenge our sports heroes to beat each other senseless as a form of entertainment. But only within the rules.
Life without limits rarely leads to satisfaction. And billionaires who pay taxes aren’t less driven or less happy than billionaires who don’t.
For them, for all single-axis competitors, it’s the game, the hierarchy, the rankings that matter. In fact, that’s true for just about everyone who cares about status. Boundaries are what allow games of status to exist.","November 15, 2019","happiness, status, limits"
Allies and accomplices,"To be an ally means that you won’t get in the way, and, if you are able to, you’ll try to help.
To become an accomplice, though, means that you’ve risked something, sacrificed something and put yourself on the hook as well.

Tell a better story,"Tell a story that is about the listener, not about you.
Tell a story that is worth sharing.
Tell a story that’s unforgettable.
And tell a story that makes things better.
Storytelling is a skill. It’s not something you’re born with, it’s not based on charisma or authority. It’s more simple than you think, but it takes practice.
Today, Akimbo is launchinga new workshop on storytelling skillsfrom bestselling author Bernadette Jiwa (with a little help from me).

"Busy is a choice, productive is a skill","Anyone can be busy. All you need to do to feel busy is to try to get two things done at once–or seek to beat a deadline that is stressing you out.
Productivity, on the other hand, has little to do with busy. Productivity requires bringing soft skills (real skills) to the table in service of the generous work you seek to do. Productivity is learned. And productivity takes guts.
We just wrapped up the most recent session of thealtMBA, and I was thrilled to see the energy and insight each contributor brought to the workshop. The feedback from our thousands of graduates doesn’t vary by country, by profession, by age or by the scale of their project. People are discovering that once they get out of their own way, they can get a huge amount done.
Once you see what’s possible, it’s amazing how much you can contribute.
Learningis not the same as education, and busy is not the same as productive.

Off stage,"I wonder what Carole King is up to? Did that kid who was in your third-grade class ten years ago get into his first choice of college? How did that couple that had a squabble in your store last week settle their argument?
We don’t notice people when they’re not in front of us. Of the tens of thousands of people, familiar and famous, that we know, we spend precious little time concerned about the ins and outs of their day. And more poignantly, the same is true for the way the world ignoresourday to day as well.
Humans’ selfish survival instinct is to be aware of whoever is on stage in front of us, and then to move on to the next urgency. It’s a trap to believe that anyone in the world is as concerned about the noise in your head as you are.
Copernicus was right–the world doesn’t revolve around us. Most of the time, the world doesn’t even notice.

Maintainers,"School trains people to work as maintainers. “The sculptures are all here in the gallery, make sure they are still here at the end of the shift… The floor is clean when you start, make sure it’s clean when you finish… The policy manual has seven rules in it, please don’t break them… The next ten patients are going to need allergy tests…” There are customers to be served, standards to be maintained, work to be done. Important work, no doubt, but not thrilling.
A few people somehow avoid these lessons and become instigators, impresarios and disruptors instead. They’re not only dancing with infinity but completely unsure what’s going to work, and yet they are hooked on leaping forward.
I think it’s possible to switch from one posture to the other. I know that it’s incredibly difficult, though. And it’s hard to do both at the same time.

The difference between memorization and learning,"In order to learn something, you must understand it. You might become so insightful and facile with the ideas that it appears you’ve memorized them, but that’s just a side effect.
Rote memorization can be done in some fields, and you can even recite what you’ve memorized to someone else who can memorize it.
For example:You can’t learn alphabetical order, you can only memorize it.
On the other hand, memorizing anything that you’ll need to build upon, improvise on or improve is foolish. You’ll need to do the work of understanding it instead.","November 9, 2019","memorization, learning, understanding"
“As a technologist…”,"If two people are having a discussion about the resilience of the food chain, and one says, “as a farmer…” it’s likely that this statement carries some weight.

The question is: Why isn’t everyone already a technologist?
Given that technology has been the defining cultural and economic driver of the last fifty years, why sign up to be a victim of what’s next?

741741 — To be seen,"A few years ago, Nancy Lublin discovered something obvious.
Nancy was the CEO ofDosomething.org, the largest teenage charity in the world.
In order to keep up with its members, Dosomething shifted their communications from email to texting (yes, that’s obvious, but that’s not what she discovered).
Monitoring the effectiveness of the texts, she realized that even though the millions of texts they were sending were clearly announcements, not personal notes, kids were texting back.
Texting is such a personal medium that it’s easy to see how the natural thing to do with an incoming text sent with permission is to write back.
Within days, Nancy was seeing that many of the return texts were from kids in trouble. Kids who were being abused, or suffering with mental issues. People who needed to be seen.
And so,Crisis Text Linewas born. Thousands of trained volunteers in the US (741741), Canada (686868) and the UK (85258) fielding millions of text messages from people who need to be seen and heard. Not just teens.
It’s not an exaggeration to say that they’ve saved thousands of lives.
CTL is running afundraiser, but that’s not why I’m posting this today. I’m posting it because someone you know might need the number.
Humans need to be seen and heard. And when we’re in crisis, the privacy and speed of a text is magical.

What are the margins for?,"A publisher recently sent me a 1,000 page book. The paper was perfect in its balance between opacity and thinness, but the margins were too small.
The production designer made a choice–push the text all the way to the edges, allowing the book to shave 20 or 30 pages in length. Sensible.
Except now, every single page seems cramped. The book is tense and can’t relax, and feels faintly amateurish. Why would a missing half-inch strip of white paper matter?
All of our media has margins. Even as computer and phone companies have made bezels ever smaller, we still want there to be a margin, a space between the thing we’re engaging with and the rest of the world. Movies have coming attractions and credits. Record albums have a few seconds between songs. Paintings have a frame, or a wall separating them from the next…
The edges do more than delineate. They give the person encountering the work confidence that a professional made it, someone who has an eye for what seems right and can respect the edges. It takes discipline to only go near the margin when you’re doing it on purpose, to make a point, not all the time.
Jackson Pollock not only abandoned the frame, he violated our understanding of the margin as well. But because he did it with intent, not out of commercial necessity or ignorance, his point was made.
The self-discipline to see the margin and use it as a tool is a gift we offer the consumer of culture.",,"margins, design, aesthetics"

All or some?,"When we’re wrestling with outsourcing project work, a key question is:
Do we give someone the entire project, or do we break it into pieces?
Should you have the architect also handle the budgets, the materials, the labor, the permits–all of it? Or should you project manage the thing and hire people for each discrete action?
Should you have your favorite freelance programmer build every element of the website, or should you have her only focus on her core skills and then you farm out the rest?
The axes are:
Coordinationvs
Span.
Coordination costs you. You need to manage it. Make sure the details match up. Get the information flow right. Coordination benefits you, because you can work in parallel, with experts.
Span of work benefits you, because one person or a tiny team sees it all. On the other hand, span of control costs you, because it means that much of the time, the work is being done by a non-expert.
If you give one person the entire project, then coordination costs go way down. It’s all in her head, and shortcuts present themselves.
On the other hand, if you break a project into tiny parts, you can find exactly the right person or process for that part, and often, they can be done simultaneously.
This is obvious, of course, but we forget to ask the question. That’s the hard part.","November 4, 2019","outsourcing, project management, coordination"
Annoyed,"Does being annoyed serve any useful purpose?
If it does, are there classes you can take or experiences you can pay for that help you become annoyed? We have gyms to get fit and mindfulness exercises to get calm, but I’m not sure I’m seeing a widespread movement toward seeking annoyance.
So, if being annoyed is simply a side effect of something else we do, and it’s not actually useful, why do we work so hard to amplify the annoyance we feel? Why create a narrative, push hard against the powerless bureaucrat or the stuck pickle jar simply to make ourselves even more annoyed?

The process vs. the outcome,"A sports fan, a zealot and a hack all look at the outcome before they decide if they’re happy with the process that led to it.
On the other hand, a scientist, an engineer or anyone searching for fairness and utility insist on a reliable process and learn to live with the outcomes (or even better, learn to work hard to change the inputs so that the next time, the useful process delivers a desired outcome.)
Instead of asking, “how did my team do?” we can begin with, “did the system do what it’s supposed to do?”
You can game the process for a little while, but that approach will always catch up with you. On the other hand, when you learn to understand first principles, you can work with them forever.
The process that gets you answers you want most of the time is probably a process worth trusting even when the answers don’t match your belief system in the moment.

Two sides of the internet,"The architecture of the internet is about choice. That’s where the resilience comes from.
Email can take one of a trillion paths to get from me to you. You have millions of pages to choose from when you want to read a blog post or learn a programming concept.
On the other hand, the business of the internet is often about no choice. Investors seek organizations that create natural monopolies, businesses with such significant network effects that they can clear the board and create infinite returns.
These network-effect businesses succeed at first because the benefits to each user are significant. We voluntarily choose to engage because it’s better (cheaper, faster, more fun) than doing it somewhere else.
But then, the implacable desire for ‘more’ kicks in and suddenly, this monopoly isn’t about serving us, it’s about enriching the owners.
And so the tension. The tension between the open resilient world of choice and the rigid and inflexible dominant monopoly.","December 30, 2019","internet, choice, monopoly"
Top speed is overrated,"The Amtrak Acela is capable of going well over a hundred miles an hour.
And yet, it’s not unusual for a 90-mile ride on the Acela to be only three or four minutes shorter than it would be on a more traditional train.
I can drive my Prius from NY to Syracuse faster than I can fly there. Even though a plane has been engineered to have a much higher top speed, the door to door costs of travel (security theatre, parking, checking in, the rest of the last mile once I land) aren’t impacted at all by the top speed of the chosen form of transport.
Top speed is easy to measure and fun to work on. But for most of the people you work with, there are dozens of factors that matter more than the easily measured versions of top speed that are talked about.
Fix the systems first. Look at the overhead of context switching. Bravery, empathy and other real skills matter far more than horsepower.","December 29, 2019","Top speed, transportation efficiency, context switching"
Slow is relative,"In between the holidays, it all seems to slow down. Most days, there is little traffic on the road (or on websites). Fewer products launched, fewer inbound emails, fewer things to check off a todo list.
And yet, if someone in 1820 had lived at the pace we live in December 2019, she would probably have dropped dead from exhaustion.
A store in New York that feels slow this time of year might be recording record traffic if it had the same turnout in Scottsdale or Tempe.
Two things are true: The world is faster and crazier than it has ever been before. And the world is as slow and predictable as it will ever be again.
Bustle and crises are local conditions.

On seeking a category,"A new ice-cream shop opened up downtown. Do you want to go?
Every word in that sentence is easy to understand. We know that a ‘newice cream shop‘ is a bit like the other ice cream shops in our experience, except a little different and probably better.
And we know where downtown is.
That’s a different question than:
Have you subscribed to Prodigy? (1989)
Want to see my iPhone? (2008)
Did you hear that podcast? (2004)
Do you know how to program an Arduino? (2016)
When you ask a question about a new entry that’s also in a new category, you’re now trying to do two things:
I’ve been living in this state of mystery for three decades. I’ve been asked by generous and interested folks, “what’s email?” as well as, “what’s a cd-rom?” and now, “what’s the altMBA?”
First you need to explain the category (which is never glib or easy) and then you can help people figure out whether they want to leap or not.

The travel agent’s problem,"Not just travel agents, but all agents.
Information scarcity is disappearing.
Forty years ago, passengers didn’t know which airline flew where and when. And forty years ago, airlines had no easy way to find out who wanted to fly somewhere. Today, of course, there’s no shortage of information or ability to connect. So paying 10% of their revenue to a human who will use a terminal instead of the passenger using a computer hardly makes sense for the airline.
Movie studios used to have to wrestle with information scarcity, and so did talented creators. Actors weren’t sure who was making what, and studios had imperfect information about who to cast. Today, IMDB (and proprietary tools) surface enormous amounts of information for the studios. They know who is working on what, who is a pain in the neck, who can add to the effectiveness of the project. And the creators are part of networks, formal and informal, that get them information faster and more efficiently than a single human often could.
The same thing is happening to car dealers. In fact, just about any job where you used to hoard information and charge a fee is now in danger.
When your clients know more than you do, it’s difficult to be an old-fashioned agent who is making money based on information scarcity.
The alternative is to become a network hub who creates value through information abundance.","December 23, 2019","information scarcity, travel agents, network hub"
The real scam of ‘influencer’,"Is popular the same as good?
Is popular possible?
Is popular your goal?
There are tens of thousands of humans spending their days trying to be popular on Instagram, buying outfits, wearing hats and seeking their version of cute. People from all backgrounds and genders, hoping to be the next Kardashian.
Facebook is filled with anonymous bots seeking to be popular.
The highest-paid YouTuber this year was an 8-year old kid.
And Twitter is the center of the politi-sphere, with each self-made pundit seeking to outdo the others.
Billions of hours spent by millions, mostly for free, to enrich a few social media platforms.
The lessons of the high school lunch table run deep.
Part of the scam is that the pyramid scheme of attention will somehow pay off for a lot of people. It won’t. It can’t. The math doesn’t hold up. Someone is going to win a lottery, but it probably won’t be us.
And a bigger part is that the things you need to do to be popular (the only metric the platforms share) aren’t the things you’d be doing if you were trying to be effective, or grounded, or proud of the work you’re doing.
When there’s a single metric (likes/followers), we end up looking in the rear-view mirror when we should be driving instead.

On writing a spec,"Good specs force the difficult conversations to happen before they are expensive.
If you hand a good spec to a builder or a programmer, the chances that you get back the system you’re hoping for are dramatically increased.
For a building, the spec is architectural plans. But give an architect a good spec and she’s much more likely to design a building you’d be happy to live in.
This post is mostly about computers and other complicated systems, but the thinking can be used for just about any project where you and your team are asking a system to solve a problem for you. Unlike buildings, computers and other systems change their state all the time, depending on what just happened and what’s supposed to happen next.
The spec outlines the inputs to the system and the outputs it creates. If it’s simple, it’s easy to write:
Put a quarter into the gumball machine and turn the crank.
A gumball comes out.
So, at the highest level, we have problems and solutions.I need a gumballis the problem, and the solution is to use this machine to turn a quarter into a gumball by releasing one from an inventory.
It gets a bit more complicated when the state of the system might change as the result of previous actions. For example, if the machine is out of gumballs, my spec requires that the quarter be returned. Knowing this, I could also add to the spec that the machine should know how many gumballs are in inventory, and how fast the sales are, so that when it has two or three days of inventory left, it sends a message to headquarters to ask to be refilled.
Inputs and outputs.
It’s worth noting that my spec doesn’t have to include any information about what gumballs are for, or how much it costs us to make gumballs. We’re defining the inputs and outputs of a system.
[It’s totally worth having a different discussion with a different team about your processes, your goals, the people you serve and the problems you seek to solve. Systems work best when they are coherent with what you actually seek to achieve… but we can leave that for another day].
It’s tempting to nail down the precise solutions to each input and output requirement early on. You might decide that the way you’re executing your system should be part of the spec from the beginning. That’s backwards. The system exists for solving problems, and the way the system executes is only there to serve that goal, not the other way around.
Maybe you don’t need a 386 processor or a tin roof to solve your problem. Let’s figure out the problem first, and worry about the way we meet your specs second.
Grab some index cards and simulate your system. Have each user write down precisely what they want to tell/ask the system and have the person running the system hand back index cards with the results that they can expect. Be clear about the state that the system is in before each transaction and after it as well.
The sum total of these interactions is your spec.
Bound this with constraints of time and money and performance and you’ve done the hard part.

I think they got successful because the idea they had inside of them somehow resonated with enough people that they get to share what they were thinking.
But the most reliably successful people I know are precisely the opposite. They are desperate to see and know what’s making other people tick. They actively engage, and they do it with empathy and generosity.

Making fairness convenient,"Modernity has caused us to care more aboutconveniencethan just about anything. We’ll trade privacy or agency or our ethical standards simply to save a few clicks.
That’s a shame. It’s nothing to be proud of. But it’s true. And so, if we want things to be more fair, it helps to make fairness more convenient. Here, for example, is an endlesscollectionof stock photos from Christina Morillo. They’re free, they’re well done and they feature women of color and other under-represented groups. Suddenly, it’s a lot easier to find a photo that opens doors and sets a wider standard for what’s normal.
Or consider a company that moves its on-campus recruiting to a college with a more diverse student body. Or an orchestra that defaults to auditioning performers behind an opaque screen. Or a job interview process that uses projects instead of live performance in an unnatural setting. Or a library that uses ramps instead of steps…
The well-grooved pathways of habit often cause us to make bad long-term decisions. And often, people run out of energy, time or resolve to do what they know they ought to do, resorting to the easy thing or the practiced thing instead. We know we can do better, but in the meantime, making it more convenient to do work we’re proud of is a good place to start.

Street vendors know that the prospect is already standing, already on the street, already on their way out the (invisible) door. It changes the dynamic between them, making the short-term the only term.
And commitment is a powerful creation tactic. When the parties involved know that they’re committed to a future together, it makes it more likely that they’ll produce a positive new version of how that future can look.

Nations are now discovering that shifts in loyalty and the transferability of assets are a real issue going forward. One option is to make secession more difficult, the other is to increase the likelihood of individuals choosing to commit.
It definitely benefits all concerned to know which path the people you serve are on. And to act accordingly.","December 10, 2019","Secession, Commitment, Negotiation"
Go outside,"Before you make a big decision, walk around the block.
If it’s raining out, take the dog for a run.
End the meeting a few minutes early and go for a stroll with the team.
Instead of an afternoon snack, consider some sunshine.
The less convenient, the more it pays.
A hard habit to create, but definitely worth it.
When in doubt, go outside. Especially when it’s inconvenient.
(If you want to see this as a metaphor, that’s good too.)

Irritated is a choice,"It’s a choice because you’re on this path by choice.
And it’s a choice because the act of being irritated involves the story we tell ourselves. People are rarely irritated by gravity, because gravity got here before us.
If you’re telling yourself a story that leads to you being irritated, you’re welcome to change your story.",,"Irritation, Choice, Storytelling"
Water towers,"On the top of many apartment buildings (and on a hill in many towns) you’ll find a water tower, a large wooden or metal container holding tons of water.
Why bother?
It turns out that a pump that slowly and consistently pumps water uphill is way more efficient than the high-powered, high-capacity pump you’d need to meet spikes in demand. By using gravity to assist during times of heavy load, the consistent and more efficient pump gets the job done by planning ahead.
We all need a water tower somewhere in our work.","December 7, 2019","Water towers, efficiency, gravity"
Only the hits,"The economics are compelling. Start a movie studio, a record label or a book publisher that only markets hits. No clunkers. No filler. Simply the hits.
Easier than it sounds.
Why doesn’t a musician go straight to a “greatest hits” record and save everyone a lot of time and hassle? Why doesn’t a salesperson only call on people who are sure to buy?
Because no one knows anything.
You won’t know if it’s a hit untilafteryou bring it to market. Dylan recorded 50 albums. Picasso painted 10,000 paintings. VCs fund hundreds of businesses.
Do your best. Then ship.

The thing about hot button issues,"It’s not that they arebuttons.
It’s that they’rehot.
They’re hot because they get pressed all the time. They’re hot because they’re seductive. It’s an easy button to push, so people push it all the time.
And that can get you burned.
It can short circuit the point you were trying to make.
It turns out that there are plenty of other buttons, often ignored, that people are eager to activate. Plenty of topics and fears and dreams and beliefs that are just waiting to be seen and engaged with.
We don’t need the risky shortcut of the hot button. It’s not going to work anyway.","December 5, 2019","hot button issues, engagement, shortcuts"
Losing with style,"The math is compelling. You’re going to lose most of the competitions you enter. How could it be any other way? With a hundred or a thousand or a billion people competing, only one wins.
Which means that you’re going to be seen and measured by how you lose, not how you win.
The way to win is usually to fit in all the way, to give the judges precisely what they want, to train just like everyone else, but harder.
But the way to lose with style is to create possibility. To be creative. To do generous work that’s worth talking about.
If you’re going to lose (and you probably will), why not lose with style?","December 4, 2019","losing, creativity, style"
Attention vs. the chasm,"I’ve heard from people who have theorized that Tesla’s window-breaking launch of the super-brutal pickup truck was either an intentional fail (look at all the publicity they got!) or a success (look at all the pre-orders they got!). The thinking goes that all attention is good attention, and that in our ever-faster, attention-starved marketplace, all that matters is clicks.
One way they’re thinking about it:Attention is the new innovation.I don’t agree.
A decade ago, innovation was the way to earn action from the early adopters. Innovation got you intoWired, innovation gave your fans something to talk about, innovation satisfied people in search of the new.
But marketers in search of widespread impact learned an important lesson: Innovation is fun, but innovation isn’t the answer to the challenge of reaching a larger audience.
Moore’sCrossing the Chasmhelped marketers see that while innovation was the tool to reach the small group of early adopters and opinion leaders, it was insufficient to reach the masses. Because the masses don’t want something that’snew, they want something thatworks, something that others are using, something that actually solves their productivity and community problems.
Therefore, to move to a bigger market, tech companies need the network effect and they need patience. Tim Cook created the profitable engine that is Apple by abandoning nerds like me and focusing on making a low-innovation luxury product instead.
Amazon innovates in some areas, but their online shopping (and AWS) are insanely boring, stable and focused on reaching more people.
[Note! There’s no requirement to seek a mass audience. It’s a choice. That’s why most of us are better off serving thesmallest viable audience, not jumping through the cycles necessary to cross the chasm.]
The lesson is simple:
Early adopters are thrilled by the new.They seek innovation.
Everyone else is wary of failure.They seek trust.
Back to Tesla. They’ve spent billions trying to move from a weird nerd vehicle for geeks to a mainstream car audience. And it’s working. The Model 3 is reaching people who didn’t even consider the original Roadster. This type of customer (which means most people, perhaps 80% of any market) is asking questions about reliability and wondering what they’ll tell their friends and spouse if they buy one. (If this sounds familiar, the very same thing happened with the Mac from 1984 until 1998… almost fifteen years of slowly moving to ‘normal’.)
Can I trust this brand? Can I trust this product to keep its promises? Can I trust my social circle to applaud my choice?
If Tesla was trying to continue along this proven route, the right move would be to make a pickup truck (which is, surprisingly to some, the bestselling single car model in the US) that would have done to the Ford F150 what the Model 3 does to a mid-market Mercedes. Innovative, but not too. Better, in all the ways that the mass market cares about. New, of course it’s new, but newandtrustworthy.
The first customers would have been innovators (that’s always who the first customers are) but they would have had a story they could easily tell to their friends and family. The story of, “I’m smart and bold and connected and this is obviously a better choice.”
But instead, in this new age in which attention is a substitute for useful innovation, they burned that trust by seeking attention instead.
The thing is, innovation has long-term benefits for all of us. The craven search for attention at all costs does not.
Musicians have figured this out–every new song has to push the envelope, has to somehow make things better and be new enough to matter–but at the same time, they can’t burn the trust of audience they’ve earned to date. The Who can smash guitars and Dylan can mumble, but Kenny G can’t do either.
When everyone is a marketer and when everyone has a platform and when everyone can burn trust to seek attention, this is a useful lesson for each of us. Because in the short run, while attention can feel like a proxy for innovation, when it comes to actual commitments, most customers choose trust instead of commotion.","December 3, 2019","Attention, Innovation, Trust"
Deep connection,"When someone tells you what you need to hear, instead of what you’re hoping to hear, you’ve found something priceless.
This takes care, generosity and guts to achieve.
When you offer this gift to someone else, it might seem like it’s unappreciated. But you didn’t do it to be appreciated, you did it because you care enough to work for a deep connection, one that makes things better.
Best to devote that energy to people and causes that can run with it.","December 2, 2019","Deep connection, generosity, authenticity"

[sorry, got distracted.]
The idea that we can strip mine attention, wasting what we don’t need, is long gone. Like oysters and oil before it, attention is a scarce resource, and we need to use it wisely. Too often, it feels cheaper to simply take what we can get, but when we overreach, the cost in trust is real.
And each of us gets the same amount of attention to spend each day. It’s a competitive advantage to figure out how to focus it to get something done.","December 1, 2019","attention crisis, focus, trust"
Zooming in–The magic of looking more closely,"Too often, we take what we are offered at face value. The zoom setting is determined by someone else, and in our rush to get onto the next thing, we fail to discover what is going on within.
The act of zooming (actually or metaphorically) is a modern thrill, the opportunity to see whatwasthere as we move closer to whatisthere. Suddenly, new levels reveal themselves to us, and we begin to see the mechanisms that are hidden from us at first glance.
My hunch is that once a medical student has understood what makes us tick, people don’t look quite the same anymore. And once you understand how the banking system works, a credit card offer feels a bit different as well.
If you want a cool example of how this works, click on this photo of 84 million stars, a composite of photos shot by a telescope in Chile. The ESO telescope is capable of putting together a 9 billion pixel image.
But once you click once, you can zoom, again and again and again. Those repeated clicks reminded me of just how vast the galaxy is, more than I ever could have learned from a single picture. It turns out that this vastness is repeated in every system in our lives. If we only care enough to zoom.

“This will change your mind”,"How often is that true?
Not very.

Choosing to be a citizen,"Citizens aren’t profit-seeking agents who are simply constrained by rules. Citizens behave even if there isn’t a rule about it.
Citizens aren’t craven partisans, voting for party over fact. Citizens do the right thing because they can, even if the short-term cost is high.
Citizens live by the rule of community: If everyone did what I’m about to do, would it lead to a useful outcome?
Sometimes we call citizens heroes, which is a shame, because their actions should be commonplace, not rare. The myth of success based on short-term self-interest has been disproven again and again. It seems obvious that leaving things better than you found them is a powerful step forward, because you’ll probably be back this way again one day soon.
Every successful community, every organization, every family has citizens. It’s the citizens who define the future, because their commitment to the long-term matters.","January 29, 2020","citizenship, community, selflessness"
In search of reciprocity,"If your posture is to give hoping that you’ll earn the moral high ground and thus get something back,you didn’t give first.
You gave second.
You’re saying, “how can I incur a debt, one that I’m going to use to achieve my goals.”
If the words ‘I’ and ‘my’ appear in your reasoning before you get to the work you’re hoping to contribute, then your goal is reciprocity. Calling it generosity merely confuses the issue.","January 28, 2020","reciprocity, generosity, self-interest"
Luck on demand,"Alas, not an option.
Luck over time is inevitable, though.
If you show up with good work and generous action, again and again, sooner or later something that appears to others to be luck will appear.
Because luck over time is a symptom of productive contributions. It rarely happens when you need it most, it almost never happens in equal proportion to what feels fair (to you or to others), but it happens.
The trap is hoping that a short-term focus on luck on demand will pay off instead.","January 27, 2020","Luck, Productivity, Generosity"
"Cars, houses and TVs","Compare 1960 to today:
Cars are a bit faster, a bit safer, higher in quality and a lot moreexpensive.
Houses are much bigger, a bit more efficient and enormously more expensive.
TVs on the other hand, are dramatically bigger, dramatically more efficient, dramatically more powerful, significantly more reliable and way cheaper. For $300, you can buy a 49 inch TV that would have cost a million dollars in 1960.
What happened?
Cars, with the exception of new electric drivetrains, are basically the same thing they were, except designed with computers and assembled by robots.
Houses, with the exception of some prefab edge cases, are still assembled by hand, on location, by skilled workers. And they went up in scale because real estate prices and income inequality went up even more.
But TVs–they made a leap. A leap from analog to digital, a leap from tubes to solid-state. Moore’s Law is at work on your television, but it’s been largely shut out of the two largest purchases most people make.
When you see computers and networks show up in an industry, it’s easy to predict what will happen next.","January 26, 2020","cars, houses, TVs"
Awareness vs. experience,"We are more aware than ever before. More aware of victims of violence, or a natural disaster. More aware of insane wealth or grinding poverty. It gets beamed to us, regularly.
We’re even more often exposed to social hijinks, sports stars or business moguls.
We’re aware that people run a marathon, or fast for a week. That they start a business or meditate every day. They know how to code, or to take pictures.
But there’s a difference between hearing about it and experiencing it.
There’s no excuse for being uninformed. But when it matters, there’s also no good reason for being inexperienced.
There’s often a piece of glass between us and the world as it’s delivered to us. That glass magnifies awareness, but it doesn’t have the same impact as experience does. It can’t.
Our awareness has been stretched wider than ever in history, but often at the cost of taking away a lifetime of experiences.","January 25, 2020","Awareness, Experience, Impact"
Obese dogs,"Dogs aren’t supposed to have willpower, that’s what they have us for.
Marketing changes culture and culture changes us. And then we end up changing the world around us. Not just the dogs, but all of it.
It’s probably a mistake for us to wait until profit-driven corporations start to worry about side effects on their own. But the moment we start voting with our attention and our dollars, they’ll begin to respond.

As simple as necessary (but not simpler),"The convenience regime is in full force. You don’t often earn points by being baroque, rococo or byzantine.
Given a choice, people will simply move on to the next thing.
“As simple as necessary” is missed by many professionals who should call themselves designers, but don’t. Consider the 30 digit code that Microsoft wants me to type in… 30 digits? That’s more than a quintillion possible combinations. A lot more. Why?
Or notice the new user interface for the useful Audio Hijack program… It’s a two-dimensional grid with clickable icons. Why isn’t it simpler?
And “but not simpler” is missed, more and more often. Items that are dumbed down to the point where they are too simple to get useful work done. Where the power is hidden from the user, because the user can’t be trusted with it. Apple continues to make things simpler than they need to be, all in the name of short-term convenience.

In the first case, there’s not a lot you can do about your “am”. It is an accurate description of a state of affairs over which you have no control.
In the second, it simply describes a choice. Anyone who wants to eat a certain way instantly becomes a vegan for as long as they make that choice.

And it bends toward justice,"Superman could bend steel with his bare hands.
Along the way, we’ve been sold on the idea that difficult tasks ought to be left to heroes, often from somewhere far away or from long ago. That it’s up to them, whoever ‘them’ is.
The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. quoted Theodore Parker: “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.”
But it’s not bending itself.And it’s not waiting for someone from away to bend it either.
It’s on us. Even when it doesn’t work (yet). Even when it’s difficult. Even when it’s inconvenient.
Our culture is the result of a trillion tiny acts, taken by billions of people, every day. Each of them can seem insignificant, but all of them add up, one way or the other, to the change we each live through.
Sometimes it takes a hero like Dr. King to wake us up and remind us of how much power we actually have.
And now it’s our turn. It always has been.","January 20, 2020","justice, responsibility, change"
Everyone is doing their best,"What if that’s not actually true? Perhaps it’s more useful to consider that in every moment, on every project,no oneis actually doing their best.
Because there’s always a need to hold a little bit in reserve.
Because there are always competing priorities.
Because everyone has a noise in their head.
Because there’s fear, a hundred kinds of fear.
Because no one has actually done the lopsided work of 100% preparation and commitment, not for this precise moment.
I’m not doing my best and neither are you. Because we’re not optimized algorithms, we’re people.

The Dolittle effect,"Why is the new Dolittle movie so bad? Savaged by critics and viewers, it had:
I think the best way to understand why it failed is to look at the reasons above. Ironically, it’s these assets and lack of constraints that created the circumstances that allowed the movie to become a turkey.
Too many meetings.
Too many self-important voices around the table.
And most of all: No one who cared enough or was bold enough to stand up and say, “no.”
That would have been enough. If at three or four critical moments in the development of the project, someone had stopped the assembly line until the work was good enough to proceed, everything would have been better.
Sometimes, the investments we put in place to avoid mediocrity are the very things that cause it.","January 18, 2020","Dolittle, failure, mediocrity"
Long-term vs short-term,"There’s always someone who is more willing to play the short-term game than you are.
Someone who is willing to cut more corners, send a more urgent text, borrow against the future, ignore the side effects, abuse trust and corrupt the system–somehow justifying that short-term hustle with a rationalization (usually a selfish one) about how urgent it is.
On the other hand…
There’s plenty of room to win as someone who takes a longer view than the others.

Here are some updates from a busy week:

Confusing hunger and thirst,"If you find yourself stranded in the desert with nothing but an endless supply of chips, you’re going to die within a week.
The same thing could happen to you if you had nothing but water to live on–it would take longer but be just as fatal. Hunger and thirst are similar, easily confused but very different.
Our culture of corporate consumption tries to persuade us that being hungry is all we need. Hungry to earn more, buy more, save more, spend more. It celebrates the hustler who doesn’t know how to stop, asserting that this person is getting all the fancy prizes because they’re contributing so much. Status is awarded to the unsated hungry person.
But they might still be thirsty. Thirsty for meaning and connection. Thirsty for the satisfaction of creating beauty. More hustle won’t satisfy those needs.","January 16, 2020","hunger, thirst, meaning"
Interaction debt,"When a company is young, with few products and fewer customers, the phone doesn’t ring and customer service is a lonely job.
As more customers arrive, each one is made a promise: we’ll be here when you need us.
Add more products, and each one carries an interaction load as well.
Add shareholders, partners and retailers, and each expects an ongoing interaction as well.
The same is true for your social media accounts. While it only takes a minute to open one, it brings with it the promise of hours (or hundreds of hours) of future interaction.
And it adds up.
If a children’s book author commits to answering the mail she gets from classrooms, each book sold (and each book written) increases the interaction debt, until there’s no time to continue writing.
Interaction is a privilege.
But it doesn’t often scale.","January 15, 2020","Interaction debt, customer service, scalability"
Fixing your email promo folder,"Your promo folder is broken, and our fix for it is a bit stuck.
If you use Gmail, you probably have thousands of emails in your promo folder. A quick look will show you that there are dozens of emails moved there by Google that you probably wish you had seen. In the last week, I found several personal notes, several calendar invites (including ones for Google’s own calendar), and newsletters from Tim Ferriss and others.
We are finding that 20% of the Slack invites we’re sending to people are ending up misfiled in the promo folder as well.
Most of us live with the misfiling because we don’t know about it, because we save so much time on the junk that disappears, and partly because we don’t know how to easily fix it without dragging emails over one at a time.
Enough of the writers and orgs I work with were frustrated by the incorrect filing of important mail by Google that I decided to work with my team to build a simple system that with just a few clicks, would move many of the emails you’re missing out of the promo folder back to where they belong.
It does this without signing you up for any new lists, without sharing your data with anyone, without reading your email.
All we’ve done is built a list of good stuff (our gold list), senders you might have signed up for but are missing.
And it’s free.
You can see the preliminary page here:98voices.com
And we’ve published ourcode basefor anyone to see on GitHub.
But…
Google has rejected the script.Even if you want to use it, Google won’t let you.
It’s not really clear to us what the problem is, and after six weeks of discussing this with them, I decided to share our impasse here on the blog.
This is all we’ve been told, unedited:
“Gmail’s tabbed inbox experience puts emails where our users want them to be, based on user corrections. Users may further customize with filters, or disable tabs altogether.”  — Google spokesperson
“The Gmail API’s data use policies give our users the confidence they need to keep their data safe. Apps that solely filter or remove filtering options in Gmail are against our policy.” — Google spokesperson

If this issue resonates with you, I hope you’ll take a minute tofill out this simple formto share your feedback with the people who run the Promo folder at Gmail. We’ll share it with them. We’re hopeful that they’ll see that it’s in everyone’s interest to let you easily take control of the folder and get the email you’d like to get out of the Promo folder.
Thanks.","January 14, 2020","Gmail, promo folder, email filtering"
The perfect argument,"Every political structure, every organization, every relationship has at least one.
The topic, that once you bring it up, must be addressed. An argument so existential that it cannot be left alone. An argument that gets to the crux of the matter, one that’s so fraught everything else pales in comparison.
I can’t even type an example from today’s world here, because if I do, the entire point of the post will be taken over by waves of urgent outrage.
Which is my point.
The purpose of the perfect argument is to make sure we don’t actually get anything done. The perfect argument is perfect because it never ends, because it is a trap for our focus and our energy. And the best reason to bring it up is that it permits someone to veto the forward motion that was about to happen somewhere else.
Perhaps the response is, “you’re right, that’s urgent, let’s discuss it after we fix the problem we’re currently working on.” Or maybe, “we need a forum to make real headway on the topic you want to discuss, but this isn’t it.”

[PS Today, we’re launching sign-ups forThe Real Skills Conference. It’s a worldwide video conference that you can do from your desktop. In less than three hours, you’ll have a chance to connect with others on a similar journey.

Compromise,"People talk about compromising like it’s a bad thing.
But we’re always doing it.
Even the most ardent vegan is killing tiny creatures in a glass of water.
There’s no economy on earth that is completely unregulated, nor is there one that’s completely state-controlled.
We’re never completely at an edge. We can’t be.
So now, the question isn’t whether or not to compromise. The question is where we’re going to be on the spectrum.
That’s a more useful place to start the conversation.

PS today’s the first lesson inThe Marketing Seminar. We’ve assembled an extraordinary cohort of people seeking to do better work. I hope you’ll check it out.","January 13, 2020","compromise, spectrum, conversation"
The dominant media narrative of the day,"The thing the media is talking about, in heavy rotation.
The breaking news, the one you’re required to give an opinion on.
The thing is, if it’s not for you, about you, or something you need to engage in, then who put it on your agenda?
The media benefits from turning you into their product, once you give them your attention.
Feel free, but do it because you’ve chosen to.
Here’s something to consider: the world doesn’t get better when you spend more time engaging with mass media. That’s pretty clear.
But it does get better when you spend more time doing things that matter. Actions matter.","January 12, 2020","media narrative, engagement, actions"
Look in the obvious places first,"That makes sense, because the obvious solution is obvious because we’ve learned how to solve problems like these. Your car keys are probably on your dresser, not in Santa Fe.
Here’s the thing: if the problem is a longstanding one, if it hasn’t been solved in a while, then the places youthinkare obvious aren’t. Because they’ve already been tried.
As time goes on, the most likely site of the solution is further and further away from what you would have guessed. So begin there instead. That’s the new obvious place.
Hint: it’s probably a place that feels uncomfortable, risky or difficult.","January 11, 2020","problem-solving, unconventional, exploration"
Falling behind vs. streaks,"The culture punishes people by reminding us that we’re falling behind. The camera focuses on the person who is winning the race instead of the one who is trying harder than ever before. The bank sends the dunning notice to the person behind on their rent and the lousy grades go to the student who hands in a paper a day late.
Fear of falling behind is a good way to enforce compliance.
But it turns out that real progress comes not from measuring ourselves against everyone else’s pace, but in building habits. And habits come from streaks.
You’re almost certainly never going to win a 26-mile marathon, but if you train every day, you’ll finish one.
In building theAkimboworkshops (likeThe Marketing Seminar, which is open for enrollment right now), we’re committed to creating a learning system where you don’t have to feel like you’re falling behind–at the very same time we’re making it likely that you’ll embrace the posture of seeking a streak. Show up every day. Do the work, return tomorrow.
Drip by drip, day by day. Habits lead to commitments and commitments create learning.
A culture of streaks can’t help but be mutually supportive. If there’s nobehind, then there’s noahead. But if we’re supporting each other in building new habits, we discover that opening the door for someone else also benefits us as well.","January 10, 2020","progress, habits, support"
Patient Capital: How long is the long run?,"If you invest in an education, you expect it to pay off in a decade.
Invest in a buy and hold investment, and you probably expect a return within a year.
Day trade bitcoin and you might be measuring your return over the course of an hour.
if you wanted to make a long-term impact on a growing country like India, what would you do?
One choice is to invest in the endless emergency of poverty, and help people who need help right this second. This is important and lifesaving work.
Another choice is to put some money into a fast-growing company that’s about to go public.
And a third option is to invest in an organization that’s bringing off-grid solar to isolated villages.
In the third case, it’s possible that your investment won’t pay off for twenty years. But during those two decades, you’ll notice that a little energy leads to enough productivity to create demand and income that can pay for a little more energy. Home by home, village by village, your small investment begins to compound, because it changes the culture and the tools and the expectations that people have about what’s next.

"Yes, marketing does matter","Because marketers make change happen.
That’s the work. Not to run ads, not to sell crap, not to invent hoopla.
Marketing makes change. If you’re not proud of the change you’re making, do something else.
It turns out that smart marketing is significantly more effective than the other kind. It turns out that showing up with the right work for the right people in the right way is a powerful tool in making change happen.
The other kind of marketing gets a bad rap, and that’s well deserved.
But real marketing, the marketing that makes things better by making better things–that’s what we need more of.
As you might have guessed, it’s time forThe Marketing Seminar. We’ve run this live digital workshop eight times already. More than 8,000 people in fifty countries have been transformed by this proven group workshop. We only run it a few times a year. Your boss will pay for it. You’ll work hard and you’ll get back far more than you put into it. The typical student gives and gets more than 500 pieces of feedback in just the first month.

The end of ‘someone’,"The following idea is endorsed by all of these people:

None of them exist.
They’re constructs, built by analgorithm. Rights released, happy and smiling, but no one in particular.
Fifty years ago, you couldn’t trust the endorsements in direct marketing ads for lousy products:
“A miracle!” …Bob
Because you knew there wasn’t really a Bob.
Twenty-three years ago, when I created a book with theWeekly World News(yes, this is true), I visited their tiny office in Florida. It consisted of three people and a filing cabinet. Inside the cabinet were pictures of 400 people (mostly friends and former friends of the three editors) that would be cut and pasted in the WWN any time they needed a picture of an expert, a citizen or both. They weren’t news and they weren’t the world, but they were weekly.
I knew that the Weekly World News was low-brow chicanery, but I have a hunch that not everyone did.
In 2019, and perhaps forever, we’re now at a new level, one where the polish of photography or video is no longer any clue at all about the provenance of what we’re encountering.
I don’t think we have any clue about how disruptive this shift is going to be.
Even the real celebrities we purport to trust (“influencers” deliberately in quotes) are easily bought. It used to be onlyRula Lenskawho we doubted.
There are people and organizations that are racing to break the fabric of community that we all depend on. Either to make a short-term profit or to atomize/vaporize widespread trust to hide from accountability and to slow change.
Like all shifts, there will be a counter-shift. But keep your eyes open, because the rules are clearly changing. Remaining trusted and consistent will become ever more valuable as it becomes more scarce. A resolution to be in higher-resolution for those you seek to serve.

“So far”/”Not yet”,"What to do in the face of failure? What happens when you’ve done your best and it still doesn’t get the review, close the sale or win the race?
One approach is to embrace the easy path of “did my best” = “failure” therefore, I should give up or simply accept mediocrity.
The other, the growth mindset, is to realize that while you did your best, it’s not your best forever, it’s just what you’ve done so far. And that while you haven’t created what you set out to create, the key word, the one you have to remind yourself of daily, isyet.
That growth mindset demands advice and collisions with the marketplace. That mindset means that you need to see what those you seek to serve have to say because without that insight, your ‘yet’ might not arrive.
By all means, ignore those that aren’t in on the joke, that haven’t signed up for the journey, that don’t want to go where you want to go.

What does ‘better’ mean?,"It’s trickier than it sounds. It’s often conflated with ‘quality’ (which means consistent adherence to spec) and ‘luxury’ (which means it costs more than it needs to).
Here’s the thing:Swedish matchesare better. They might be the best in the world. They do everything a match should do–but better. They light more quickly, burn hotter, and give more match satisfaction.
Except you probably don’t have a box in your house.

Because for you (and for billions of non-match-loving people around the world), this sort of better isn’t your sort of better. Your sort of better, when it comes to matches, might be: free and handy.

Overwhelmed is a choice,"The internet is infinite. For humans, anyway.
In the time you’ve been reading this, more than an hour of video has been uploaded to YouTube. You will never catch up.
The thing is, the world has always been infinite compared to human scale.
Living on a bucolic farm in the 14th century, there was no need to get bored. You could study earthworms, write a sonnet or have a conversation with your neighbor…
We widen or close our lens on the world in order to avoid becoming too bored or feeling too small.
When you first encounter a new web service, go on Slack or get back to your computer after a break, it’s natural to feel overwhelmed. Too much to sort. We want a foundation to stand on, but firm footing eludes us for a while.
And then we find it again. Because we intentionally make ourselves unaware of the rest of it.
Right now, orbiting a distant star, the folks on Planet 10 are having a conflict about something or other. But we have no idea. And right now, someone who works for you has a question, or the store you’re not in is having a problem, or a co-worker is doing something without your oversight–and it’s all proceeding without you, because total information awareness is a fiction.

What’s a fellowship?,"For five hundred years, a fellowship was understood, Tolkien-style, to be a collection of humans engaged in mutual support. [Definition]
It’s hard to imagine something more reassuring, challenging and productive, all at once.
To be part of an organized fellowship is a responsibility and also the chance to leap forward. Join the others, people like you, eager to see and to be seen, and most of all, to be of service. (Worth noting that ‘fellow’ it is not gender-specific and in fact isusedin the Old Testament in reference to women).
A few decades ago, our status and selection-based culture shifted a common meaning of the word to describe a sort of prize. You get picked for a fellowship, maybe you even get some money, and you can definitely put it on your resume. Missing, too often, is the original magic, the idea that the others are there with you, side by side, together.
That new sort of fellowship isn’t really helpful to most of us. I’m more interested in the traditional, effective kind. Mutual support and a shared journey.
There are organic fellowships everywhere, which sprouted on their own, seemingly out of nowhere, and if you find yourself in one, that’s a wonder to be cherished. They don’t need a name or a published agenda. Simply being in it is sufficient.
For the rest of us, there’s the chance to go start one. Start a fellowship, invite some people along, and then do the hard work to keep it going. All for one and one for all.

Time shifting,"If the people you seek to engage with have a choice, they’re likely to make a choice that’s in their self-interest.
The question is: When?
Is it in a high school student’s self-interest to light up a cigarette on a Friday night? In the short run, the answer might be yes. Ask that person in forty years if it was a good idea to be tricked by advertising and peer pressure into a lifetime of expense and illness, and the answer is probably ‘no’.
When we try to change behavior to make culture better, what we’re actually doing is trying to get people to change their timeframe. The more sophisticated an audience believes it is, the easier it is to help them see that there’s more than the next ten seconds in front of them. Mobs, on the other hand, only care about what feels good in this very moment.
The insight is in understanding that perception of time–not just money, not just features, not just narrative–is actually the driving force of much of what is happening when we try to change minds.

The free market is elusive,"Free markets aren’t particularly common.
At the baseball game, the snack vendors sell what the person with the concession tells them to sell. It’s a choice, but Hobson’s choice: take it or leave it.
Geography makes the idea of a free market difficult, because only one business can exist in any given spot. Fifth Avenue in New York seems like an epicenter of commerce, but long-term leases and the need for millions and millions of dollars in free cash flow mean that there are actually very few degrees of freedom and not much choice.
Free markets are a powerful engine to solve people’s problems, but free markets are difficult to ensure for the long haul.
The web cuts through the geography problem. Shopify is fine with a million or even a billion stores–they don’t take up any space.
And when the web was young, the free market in ideas was open to anyone with access to a library’s internet connection.
But the web rewards network effects and network effects have led to monopolies. Google doesn’t really want a free market in ideas (they hate blogs), instead, they want a market in which they’re the landlord. Facebook enabled a huge outpouring of voices from people who didn’t previously have a microphone, but their algorithms and focus on clicks led toward incentives for outrage as the voices corroded so many elements of our culture. This reinforces the idea that the public doesn’t always want a free market—they’d rather have a convenient one, a predictable one and a safe one instead.
And so we have Lyft, a ‘market’ in name only, because drivers can’t name their fares or produce any innovations.
Our culture has generally moved, in bits and pieces, from a totally free market (the open cry bazaar on the steppes of Mongolia) to one in which more and more interactions are fenced in due to market power and regulation.
We’ve gained a lot in terms of reliability and the management of side effects. But we’ve lost flexibility and speed as well.
Most people who bemoan the loss of the free market don’t actually want to live in a world where that’s all there is. At the same time, fighting market power in our quest for better solutions is a worthy effort.

Painting fakes and singing covers,"When a pop band goes on the road to promote a hit record, they’re almost certainly re-singing a version of their work that matches what the fan expects to hear, not the daring, original work that they actually might feel like playing that night.
And when, twenty years later, they go on a reunion tour, the same is true, but even more so. The band make-up has changed, their tastes have changed, and they’re an oldies act now. Playing covers of their own work.
Every once in a while, Pablo Picasso painted a daring new work of art. But most of his 10,000 paintings rhymed with the ones he’d done before. In his words, “I often paint fakes.”

You’re invited as a guest into a purpose-built room in our Slack.
We’ll pay your invoices before they’re due.
We agree that all of our interactions are off the record, unless we agree otherwise.

We don’t miss deadlines.
We don’t sprint at the end, we sprint at the beginning.
We don’t make compromises simply because bad planning means that we’re running out of time.
We eagerly highlight the potholes ahead, but spend no time casting blame after something fails.
We are intentional and specific about the work. “Who is it for” and “what is it for?” are the two key design questions.
We don’t use semi-colons or animated emojis.

The bad client/clueless boss trap,"“I’m doing this meaningless/damaging/banal work because that’s what the client wants.”
There are many variations of this.
The plastic surgeon who does hideous work on the faces of people who demand it. The marketer who’s still trying to get teens hooked on smoking. The teacher who blames the curriculum for the boring classroom experience because that’s what the state mandated…
It’s a trap, like all traps, because there’s a lot of truth to it. In fact, the client might be misguided or selfish or lazy. In fact, the boss doesn’t care enough.
Fine, that happened.
But what we do about it is the spot where we either excel or fail. If all we had were great opportunities for insightful clients and bosses, then important work wouldn’t be scarce at all.
As professionals, part of our job is to educate our client to keep them from doing something stupid, short-term or selfish. As linchpins, we get to choose our boss, and if you’re unable to persuade them to raise the bar, then the obligation/opportunity is to go do something else.

Unaided awareness,"Name a brand of sneaker. Name a flavor of ice cream. Name a dead rock star.
If you came up with answers like Nike, Chocolate or Prince, you’re not alone. This is unaided awareness, the ability to name a member of a category without having to choose from a list.
It’s tempting to want to be the Nike of your category. It really pays off in group situations, where someone wants to be sure to choose an option that ‘everyone has heard of.’
But unaided awareness isn’t a useful goal. Because most decisions that matter aren’t unaided. Most choices are made with some consideration. What people say about you is even more important than being on everyone’s notorious list.

Information wants to be free*,"*No, that’s not what he said, and no, it’s not completely true.
Thirty-five years ago, in a conversation with Steve Wozniak (pioneer of the personal computer), Stuart Brand (founder of the Whole Earth Catalog along with many other foundational disruptions),said:
On the one hand you have — the point you’re making Woz — is that information sort of wants to be expensive because it is so valuable — the right information in the right place just changes your life. On the other hand, information almost wants to be free because the costs of getting it out is getting lower and lower all of the time. So you have these two things fighting against each other.
This is prescient, and it deserves to be quoted or at least paraphrased correctly.
Information wants to be free or it wants to be expensive.
How can both be true?
Information that seeks the network effect, that is most useful when lots of people know it, that changes the culture–well, making this information free is the best way to accomplish this effect. The alphabet wants and needs to be free, because if you had to pay to learn and use a set of letters to make words, it wouldn’t be universally adopted and would fail. The same is true for the pursuit of hit records–getting played on the radio is the goal of the label, even if the radio is giving the music away. The music is ‘worth’ more when it’s a hit.
The tension for so many creators is that they’re used to friction associated with their mass-produced work, friction that used to pay them better than it does now. This is the shift that Brand is talking about in half of his statement.
But some information is valuable because it creates barriers to entry, gives a few people a head start, confers status, solves a specific problem in real-time, etc.
There’s no reason to price the design of a custom addition to a home by a famous architect at free. The person who’s buying it doesn’t benefit from it being free–they benefit from the status that comes from it being scarce.
And the information that comes from a meeting that’s only open to paying attendees is worth more because you got to learn it and others didn’t.
And Michael Bloomberg is a billionaire because his company sells information to companies just a few seconds faster than they can get it anywhere else. The cost of the information creates scarcity and the scarcity creates value.
[This post was inspired by a poorly edited headline and article in theTimesyesterday that got the quote wrong and is also remarkably (or sadly, not remarkably) sexist. It’s hard to imagine it having the same tone if it were written about a man.]","February 9, 2020","Information, Scarcity, Value"
The imbalance between media and advertisers,"For a very long time, major magazines and TV networks were very strict about the ads that they would run. The format, content and impact of an ad had to be approved before it showed up on network TV orThe New Yorker.  There weren’t many good places to run ads, so the media companies had the power.
Now, thanks to algorithmic media buying and the rise of digital, the media company sometimes has no idea who is even placing the ad, never mind how it works or what it’s for.
Ads aren’t vetted, they interrupt and they engage in a race to the bottom. As a result, your phone starts blaring an ad when you’re in a meeting trying to check the train schedule. And the biggest digital companies have given up and simply ignore the content and format of their ads. When a media company does try to establish standards, the algorithms simply go somewhere else.
The shift has gone from the context the ad runs in (which magazine) to the consumer it is targeted to. And that means that if a consumer sees an ad on platform A vs. platform B, the advertiser doesn’t really care. They’re just picking the cheap ones.
Ultimately, this destroys the value of the media company, corrupts our culture and hurts the long-term viability of the brands that have worked so hard to cut corners.
It’s possible to stand up and insist on better instead of cheaper. The entire world doesn’t have to look like the worst Android app.

What’s it for? a simple example,"The lunch you’re catering at the wedding of a friend next week—who’s it for?
It might be for the bride, because it’s her special day, so you should make food she likes.
It might be for the guests, because they’re the guests, and so you should make something universally appreciated, the way you’d cook for a Super Bowl party.
It might be a chance to have an audience for your food, so you can cook to impress.
It might be to earn status for the parents of the bride, so nachos are out of the question.
It might be to demonstrate conspicuous consumption. Spending far more than you have to in order to amaze and impress the guests.
Or it might be to get by without your budget showing, so that prestige is conferred at a lower actual cost.
It might be to please the facilities manager, who is a real jerk, and who has power over you.
Or perhaps your waitstaff will walk off the job if they have to hand roll and serve 1,000 stalks of asparagus in puff pastry.

Will you join us? A new workshop for creatives,"The magic of the workshops we’re running is that we do them together.
That’s not how most online education works. Which is odd, because learning almost always works that way. Find the others. Give and get feedback. Learn by doing. See the work, do the work, repeat.
Our newworkshoplaunches today. It’s about trusting yourself enough to be seen. It’s for writers, artists and anyone who seeks to create as a professional. The Creative’s Workshop is about understanding genre, showing up to do the work and figuring out what it means to turn pro.
It’s a writer’s workshop, a seminar and a mastermind group rolled into one. Not just for writers, but for anyone who seeks to be creative as a professional.
This 100-day workshop features interviews with Cyrille Aimee, Eliot Peper, Christian McBride, Gabe Andersen and the extraordinary Patricia Barber. As well as a video interview I did with Cathy Heller and a priceless riff from Brian Koppelman. But most of all, it features you and people like you.
Because it works when we do it together.

Portfolio school: Get better clients,"There’s a tragedy unfolding all around us, unevenly distributed. It’s about health and it’s also about the economy. We are called upon to not panic, to try to focus, to figure out how to make it all work. And many of us are overwhelmed. From health care workers who are burning the candle at both ends to parents with too many demands on their time, it’s been crazy.
And if you’re a freelancer, it can be challenging because the steady gigs or the easy gigs might be on hold.
If you’re fortunate enough to have time on your hands, what to do with the downtime?
If you’re looking for a gig or if you’re hoping for a new client…
It’s easy to get stuck waiting.The alternative is not to wait.
More time spent fretting isn’t going to help.
The alternative is to dig in and build your portfolio.
A portfolio that includes three things:
ONE: What are you good at? You can dramatically increase your skillset (including your attitude about the work you do) in just a few days of focused effort.
TWO: What have you done? You can actually do work, real work, volunteer work, spec work, digital work and you can do it right now.
THREE: How have you expressed 1 and 2? When we look at your portfolio, what do we see?
You are not your resume. Your prospects are based on the work you’ve done and the way you do it.
When you do a good job on your skills, your work historyandyour expression, you’re more likely to get better clients.
Getting better clients is super simple and really difficult. The current environment makes it even harder, which means we need to be prepared for a longer, more difficult process ahead.
The benefit of better clients is pretty clear: They challenge you to do better work, they talk about you and your work, they pay on time, they want you to do work you’re proud of and they’re motivated to do more than most people expect.
The difficult part is becoming the sort of freelancer that better clients seek out.
Because while it’s true that better clients make you a better freelancer, the work is too important to simply wait for them to show up. Particularly during difficult and uncertain times. Maybe this is an opportunity to reset expectations and recommit to the practice.
If you’re seeking better clients, I hope you’ll check outThe Freelancer’s Workshop. It launches today. You can save some money by clicking the purple circle, which is at maximum value today.

GenC,"It doesn’t really pay to classify multitudes by their age–every generation is complex and intermingles with all the others.
But it might be a useful way to understand the issues we’ve faced and where we might be heading.
Generation C was inaugurated with the events created by Covid-19, and it is defined by a new form of connection.
There’s a juxtaposition of the physical connection that was lost as we shelter in place, and the digital connection that so many are finding online.
Not just a before and after for the economy, but for culture, for health, for expectations. School and jobs are different now, probably for the long term.
No idea or behavior shift has ever spread more quickly or completely in the history of the planet. In seven weeks, the life of every single person on Earth changed, and the unfolding tragedy and the long slog forward will drive expectations for years. Expectations about being part of a physical community, about the role of government and about what we hope for our future.
If previous cycles of media were about top-down broadcast (from radio, TV and cable), the last few years have been about the long tail, about giving a microphone to anyone who wanted one. But now, the peer to peer power of the internet is dominating. The Kardashians won’t be as important as 3,000 people with a thousand connections each. Never mind a million people with 100 each.
Companies are now competing to see how few employees they have instead of how many. The lattices of the connection economy are racing to replace the edifice complex of the previous one.
And ifCovid-19andConnectionare the first two C’s, the third one is going to beCarbon.
Because we’re going to need to pay. All of us. To pay for the dislocations and to pay for the treatment and to pay for the recovery.
Worldwide cataclysms are different from local ones. As we shift gears and seek to revitalize our economy, put people to work and build a resilient future, it might be tempting to drill and burn, and to try to adopt an emergency footing that disregards any long-term future more than a few months ahead. But GenC may be too wise for that. And they may be connected enough to speak up and overrule the baby boomers.
A threat and an enemy will focus public attention. For a long time, that enemy was other people or other nations, and an us-vs-them mindset was a great way to get attention or get elected. But just as we came to understand that you can’t bully a virus, you can’t personalize carbon either.
The worldwide challenge of carbon is not a problem for someone else, it’s a problem for all of us. Using carbon consumption as a way to pay for rebuilding our community brings all three Cs together.
Emergencies are overrated as a response mechanism. Preparation and prevention are about to become a more popular alternative.
My generation was the dominant voice for sixty years. A voice that worried about the next 24 hours, not the next 24 years. That’s about to shift, regardless of what year you were born.

“I’ll go with my principles tomorrow”,"In the short run, it’s easy to abandon what we believe. Deep down, we assume that once things go back to normal, so will we.
Organizations end up with bullies, predators and bad actors for only one reason: In this moment, it’s easier to keep them. There’s some sort of urgency that makes asking them to leave too difficult right now, so we put it off for a little while. When we make a “just this once” exception, we’ve already made a decision about what’s truly important.
And the same goes for those moments when we’re inclined to be, just for a moment, a bully, a predator or a bad actor as well. Few people decide to be selfish for the long haul.
What makes it a principle is that we do it now, even though (especially though) it’s hard.","March 29, 2020","principles, integrity, decision-making"
Communicating online (the big leaps),"It’s not just like the real world but with keyboards.
Leap 1: Attention is too easy to steal online, so don’t. Spam is a bad idea. Interrupting hundreds or millions of people doesn’t cost you much, but costs each person a lot. You wouldn’t stand up in the middle of a Broadway play and start selling insurance from the audience. Don’t do it with your keyboard. Permission is anticipated, personal and relevant.
Leap 2: There’s a difference between asynchronous and synchronous interaction. We know this intuitively in the real world (a letter is different from a phone call) but online, it’s profound. A discussion board isn’t the same as a Zoom call. It turns out that we can create rich and layered conversations with async communication, but we also have to be just a bit more patient.
Leap 3: More than one person can ‘talk’ at a time. In the real world, that’s impossible. At a table for six, we take turns talking. But in a chat room, we can all talk at the same time. Use it well and you can dramatically increase information exchange. But if you try to follow all the threads, or you miss what you need, then it’s actually less effective.
Leap 4: Sometimes we leave a trail. Most real-life conversations are inherently off the record because the words disappear right after we say them. But if you use a keyboard, or you’re attached to a server, assume you’re being recorded and act appropriately. And sometimes the people who are talking are anonymous (which never happens in the real world).
It’s possible, with effort, to transform business communications (and schooling) away from the top-down, synchronized, compliance-focused, off-the-record, hierarchical and slow status quo to something significantly more fluid and powerful. But we’ll need to do it on purpose.

Generous isn’t always the same as free,"People have been generous with you through the years. A doctor who took the time to understand your pain. A server who didn’t hesitate and brought you what you needed before you even knew you needed it. A boss who gave you a project at just the right time.
Gifts create connection and possibility, but not all gifts have monetary value. In fact, some of the most important gifts involve time, effort and care instead.
Money was invented long after humans arrived on the scene, and commerce can’t solve all problems.
In this moment when we’re so disconnected and afraid, the answer might not be a freebie. That might simply push us further apart. The answer might be showing up to do the difficult work of connection, of caring and of extending ourselves where it’s not expected.","March 27, 2020","generosity, connection, care"
Is everything going to be okay?,"That depends.
If we mean, “Is everything going to be the way it was and the way I expected it to be?” then the answer isno. The answer to that question is always no, it always has been.
If we mean, “Is everything going to be the way it is going to be?” then the answer isyes. Of course. If we define whatever happens as okay, then everything will be.
Given that everything is going to be the way it’s going to be, we’re left with an actually useful and productive question instead: “What are you going to do about it?”","March 26, 2020","acceptance, change, agency"

Moods and actions,"The way we feel can be triggered by outside events.

This is a perfect moment for upskilling. For a sprint in learning something that’s difficult to learn. Not because a teacher or a boss made us do it, but because we chose to. Not only do we get to keep that skill forever, but the act of taking control and expending the effort will change our mood.
And this is the perfect moment for generous connection. Going way beyond the news of the day, we have the chance to create intimate digital interactions that last.
It’s a significant posture shift, one which might change who you see when you look in the mirror.
We might not be able to do anything about external events, but we have control over our actions. Sometimes, it’s hard to stare right into that opportunity, because it comes with a lot of responsibility.

Day trading emotions,"When the stock market is on an upward tear, day trading becomes popular. You sit in your basement, surrounded by terminals and tickers, searching for the latest bits of information, hoping to make a profit buying and selling based on what’s happening in this very instant.

Calm also has a coefficient,"Panic loves company.
And yet calm is our practical, efficient, rational alternative.
If you’re on a crowded plane and one person is freaking out about turbulence, the panic will eventually peter out. If, on the other hand, six people are freaking out, it’s entirely possible that it will spread and overtake the rest of the plane. Panic needs multiple nodes to spread.
The same is true with a cabin of 10-year-olds at summer camp. One homesick kid usually comes around and ends up enjoying the summer, because being surrounded by others who are okay makes us okay. But three or four homesick kids can change the entire dynamic.
While calm is a damping agent, it’s not nearly as effective at spreading itself as panic is.
The library is usually a quiet place because the dominant cultural narrative in the library is to be quiet. Because it’s dominant, the coefficient of its spread is sufficient to keep it that way. We have to expend effort to create environments of calm, because calm has a coefficient that can’t compete with panic when it comes to spreading.
And Twitter? Twitter has been engineered tomaximizepanic. Calm is penalized, panic is amplified. And if you are hanging out in real life with people who spend a lot of time on social media and news sites, you’ve invited all of those people into your circle as well.
We can find lots of reasons why fifty years of watching just three dominant TV networks wasn’t ideal. But the combination of oligopoly and the FCC meant that none of them spread panic. They weren’t built for it. When cable “news” showed up, they discovered that panic was a great way to make a profit. Not to make things better, simply to spread anger and fear.
If panic is helpful, of course you should bring it on. But it rarely is.
Instead:
Curate your incoming.
Stay off Twitter.
Do the work instead. Whatever needs doing most is better than panic.

The conversation,"A short manifesto about the future of online interaction
[Feel free to share.]
The world is changing. Faster and more suddenly than most of us expected.
And beyond the fraught health emergencies that so many are going through, many of us are being asked to quickly move our meetings and our classes online.
Fortunately, there are powerful and inexpensive tools to do just that. Unfortunately, we’re at risk at adopting a new status quo that’s even worse than the one it replaces.
We can make it better.
You have a chance to reinvent the default, to make it better. Or we can maintain the status quo. Which way will you contribute?
Rather than doing what we’ve always done in real-life (but online, and not as well), what if we did something better instead?
Here’s what wethinkwe get from a real-life meeting:
Here’s what weactuallyget:
Real-life meetings are among the most hated part of work for the typical office worker. They last too long, happen too often and bore and annoy most of the people who attend. They can mostly be replaced by a memo (if they’re abouttransferringinformation) or they could be better run (if they’re abouttransforminginformation.)
But at least you’re not in school.
The traditional school day is nothing but a meeting.Eight hours of it. In which you are almost never asked to contribute, or, if you are, it’s at great risk, both social and in terms of academic standing.
And now, because of worldwide events, local meetings and local schooling are going online.
It will lead to one of two things:
1. Just like the ones in real-life, except worse.
2. Something new and something better.
Forgive me for not being optimistic, but if what we’re seeing is any guide, we’re defaulting to the first (wrong) choice.
It’s worse because you can check your phone, your email and your fridge. It’s worse because you can more clearly see the faces of people who are bored right in front of you who can’t realize you can see them.
[Did you know that there’s a ‘focus’ button in Zoom and other tools that shows the organizer when people in the room have put Chrome or something else in front and are only sort-of paying attention? It’s there to ensure compliance and it’s there because we’re figuring out how to not pay attention.]
The compliance of the mandatory Zoom meeting is not nearly as firm as it is in real life. It’s like an episode of the Office, except it’s happening millions of times a day.
And then when we try to move classes online! First we coerced students to pay attention with grades, withholding what they want and need (a certificate, a diploma, an A) in exchange for them giving up their agency and freedom and youth.
Then, because we weren’t getting enough compliance, we invented the clicker.
It’s a pernicious digital device that probably had good intent behind it, but like so many things that are industrialized, it’s now more of a weapon than a tool.
How the clicker works: Every student at a large university is required to buy one. Yes, you need to spend more of your own money to be controlled. It has built-in ID (it knows who you are) and wifi and GPS. Inside the lecture hall, you need to click. Click to prove you’re there. Click to prove you’re awake. Click to prove you can repeat what the professor just said.
Sure, it’spossible to use clickersto produce powerful and engaging discussion. My quick research seems to indicate that this almost never happens. It’s easier to have the student simply pay for compliance in exchange for the certificate.
So, we have a few problems:
1. The in-person regime of meetings and school is riddled with problems around status, wasted time, compliance, boredom and inefficient information flow.
2. Moving to online gives up the satisfaction of the status quo, diminishes the ego satisfaction for those seeking status, and creates even more challenges with compliance, boredom and the rest.
But…
There’s a solution. A straightforward and non-obvious choice.
Let’s have a conversation instead.
A conversation involves listeningandtalking. A conversation involves a perception of openness and access and humanity on both sides.
People hate meetings but they don’t hate conversations.
People might dislike education, but everyone likes learning.
If you’re trapped in a room of fifty people and the organizer says, “let’s go around the room and have everyone introduce themselves,” you know you’re in for an hour of unhappiness. That’s because no one is listening and everyone is nervously waiting for their turn to talk.
But if you’re in a conversation, you have to listen to the other person. Because if you don’t, you won’t know what to say when it’s your turn to talk.
Conversations reset the power and compliance dynamic, because conversations enable us to be heard.
Conversations generate their own interest, because after you speak your piece, you’re probably very focused on what someone is going to say in response.
You don’t have to have a conversation, but if you choose to have one, go all in and actually have one.
And here’s the punchline:
The digital world enables a new kind of conversation, one that scales, one that cannot possibly be replicated in the real world.
There’s even a special button for it in Zoom, and if you have enrollment and the passion to engage with it, you can use it to create magic.
We know, because we’ve done it atAkimbo. We’ve created important and useful conversations for a group of 700 people at a time. More than 97% of the people who joined our online meeting were in it at the end. With no coercion, no diploma, no grades and no clickers.
If we want to, we can use Zoom to create conversations, not a rehash of tired power dynamics. We can create peer to peer environments where conversations happen.
Here’s how it works:
0. The most important: Only have a real-time meeting if it deserves to be a meeting. If you need people to read a memo, send a memo. If you need students to do a set of problems, send the problems. If you want people to watch a speech or talk, then record it and email it to them. Meetings and real-time engagements that are worthy of conversations are rare and magical. Use them wisely.
1. People come to the meeting ready to have a conversation. If they’re coerced to be there, everything else gets more difficult.
2. Part of being engaged means being prepared. Consider thissimple 9 point checklist.
3. Organize aconversation. That can’t work at any scale more than five. How then, to do an event with hundreds of people? The breakout.
A standard zoom room permits you to have 250 people in it. You, the organizer, can speak for two minutes or ten minutes to establish the agenda and the mutual understanding, and then press a button. That button in Zoom will automatically send people to up to 50 different breakout rooms.
If there are 120 people in the room and you set the breakout number to be 40, the group will instantly be distributed into 40 groups of 3.
They can have a conversation with one another about the topic at hand. Not wasted small talk, but detailed, guided, focused interaction based on the prompt you just gave them.
8 minutes later, the organizer can press a button and summon everyone back together.
Get feedback via chat (again, something that’s impossible in a real-life meeting). Talk for six more minutes. Press another button and send them out for another conversation.
This is thrilling. It puts people on the spot, but in a way that they’re comfortable with.
If you’re a teacher and you want to actually have conversations in sync, then this is the most effective way to do that. Teach a concept. Have a breakout conversation. Have the breakouts bring back insights or thoughtful questions. Repeat.
A colleague tried this technique at his community center meeting on Sunday and it was a transformative moment for the 40 people who participated.
If you want to do a lecture, do a lecture, but that’s prize-based education, not real learning. If people simply wanted to learn what you were teaching, they wouldn’t have had to wait for your lecture (or pay for it). They could have looked it up online.
But if you want to create transformative online learning, then allow people to learn together with each other.

Public health,"[For members of the public, staying at home and sheltering in place isn’t selfish, it’s generous. Social distancing helps keep the virus from infecting others at the same time that itflattensthe curve of the spread of the pandemic, giving health facilities a chance to provide care over time.]
Public health is efficient, a culture changer and a commitment. It’s not simply a more expensive version of private health.
When the water supply is reliable, the air is clean and the public health system is working well, we hardly notice it. Nutrition, access to healthcare and the safety of transport are easy to take for granted. When we hire the government to be responsible for public health, we give up small amounts of independence and money. But it creates enormous benefits, worth far more than they cost.
First, it’s cheaper and more reliable for a few trained engineers to test and maintain the water etc. than it is for each person who consumes it to do so.
Second, health, like the weather, is something that people bring up in conversation but rarely do anything about. By centralizing action, we make it more likely that something actually gets done.
Third, individual humans arebadat long-term thinking. Patient systems often outperform individual actions when it comes to public health.
Often, it’s only coordinated action that can help the entire community. And coordinated action rarely happens without intentional coordination. Don’t do it because you finally got around to it. Don’t do it because it is in your short-term interest. Do it because we all need it done.
It’s difficult to overinvest in building and running competent public health systems and management. And sometimes we don’t realize how important the system is until we see how unprepared we are. [Which is why, alas, today is a good day to stay home].

"React, respond or initiate?","That’s pretty much all that’s on offer.
What will you do next?
The first gives us visceral satisfaction and emotional release, and it almost always leads to bad outcomes.
Responding is smarter. It requires each of us to think hard about the action and emotion we seek to create after something is put on our desk.
And the third? Initiating is ever easier and leveraged than ever before, which, surprisingly, also makes it more difficult to move up on our agenda.
In normal times, it’s easy to get into a rhythm of simply responding. Someone else setting the agenda.
When things are uncertain, it’s easy to react.
But now, right now, is the single best time to initiate. We’re in for a slog, but there will be an end to it.

Homemade science,"Homemade art is essential. It’s the only kind that resonates. A human, doing something that might not work. Something generous.
Homemade cuisine is the basis of all the food we eat. A chef, a terroir, a culture, coming together to make something memorable, real and delicious.
And homemade solace, the human to human connection of one person to another is at the heart of who we are.
But homemade science and homemade engineering are obsolete.
That’s because science and engineering are about rigor. Show your work. Do the math. Prove it.
Darwin and Newton and Galileo began as homemade scientists, but then they shifted gears and put in the effort to show their work and test their work. That’s the difference between alchemy and calculus.
The other elements of our lives depend on feelings and opinion and point of view. But a bridge doesn’t care about whether you’re sure it will hold up a truck. It either holds up a truck or it doesn’t.
Your backyard photo of a UFO is insufficient. Putting a stock photo of a doctor on a book of debunked folk myths is insufficient as well. Your conspiracy theories are a waste.
Silver beads aren’t going to protect us from a virus, regardless of how much the person selling them wants us to believe that they will.
Just because someone has a microphone doesn’t mean that we should listen to them. The obligation to those that would speak up is simple: don’t sort-of do science. Either do it or don’t.
If you want to do science and engineering, please do. We need innovation and forward motion. And it often comes from outsiders, from the less-credentialed, from people with a point of view. But be prepared to bring rigor, not just bluster. Show your work. Actively engage in the iterative work to make things better.
Professor Lisa Randall said, “The misleading thing about science is that people have epiphanies, those aha moments, all the time. But then someone says, ‘You’re probably wrong,’ and someone else says, ‘You’re probably right.’ Sometimes you do have big insights, and that’s very exciting, but in research, you must balance these moments with a more sober approach. What are we missing? Why has this not been recognized before?”
Human beings are complicated creatures. Our beliefs, our culture, our actions–they’re not easily predicted or changed. That’s why marketing is so fascinating. But science? Science is a subset of human activity, reserved for people committed to a method based on the rigorous testing of hypotheses and outcomes.

Work from home,"Three tricky words.
Tricky because home used to be a refuge from work. Home is safe, work brings tension. Home is long-term, work might not be.
But mostly because the industrial, cog-oriented mindset of work is that you should keep your head down, avoid responsibility and look busy! The factory owner seeks productivity, which equals more, which means pushing people to go faster. The natural response is to hold a little bit back, because if you don’t then you’ll just have to do more anyway.
Some might wonder about kids who are homeschooled, because they haven’t been processed by the compliance-focused industrial schooling system. Can they really be trusted in a factory environment, they ask.
An aside about the clickers: Large universities now require undergraduates in lecture classes to bring a clicker with them to class. The clicker confirms their attendance. The clicker can be used throughout by the professor to ensure that students are paying attention. The clicker can easily lead to better training. Sort of the way it works on dogs, but backwards.
Click training is not going to create the sort of professional who can work from home. It simply pushes us to comply even more closely with a system that monitors us as we work to find an answer that the boss knew all along.
And when Harvard sends every student home to take virtual classes after spring break, they give up the social dynamic that is Harvard, but are they also going to learn anything, really?
They will if they want to.
That’s the key to the whole thing. Unless you’re doing easily measured piecework in the old-fashioned cottage industry mindset (the original work from home job), then the opportunity is to raise your hand, not keep your head down.
Some jobs and some schools reward people who lead, connect and volunteer.
Slack and other distributed online systems make it easier than ever to build a flat organization. Which makes it more likely that people who want to lead can lead.
When you work from home, you can sit back and wait for assignments and hope you won’t get picked. You can be sure to click the clicker when required.
Or can you decide to change your posture. With all the time you save by not going to meetings and not commuting, you can run with the opportunity. Turn the freedom into responsibility instead of fearing or hoping for authority.
Some jobs don’t lend themselves to this opportunity. If that’s true, you could figure out how to change the organization or go find one that deserves you and your commitment to the work.
The best way to work from home is to plan your own agenda, organize your peers, make bigger promises, show up often, lead, connect, innovate and ask hard questions. And then do it all again.
You will if you want to.
Stay home.
Stay home, it’s a good idea. It’s a generous way to help people stay safe. Stay home and lead.
In the long run, which is getting shorter all the time, people with a linchpin mindset are valued more highly, given more opportunities and make a bigger impact. This is a chance to enroll in the journey of making a difference.

Stuck at home,"A friend told me that she was dreading a possible quarantine in response to the worldwide health emergency.
“But you work at home,” I said. She agreed with me, but made it clear that when it washerchoice, it felt different.
The first job is taking care of the people around you and helping others get their health back.
After that, we have choices to make. Choices about how to spend our time, how to connect and how to view the change to our lives.
What if we committed to watching less Netflix, not more? Fewer news updates, fewer YouTube videos, fewer digital distractions.
What if we decided to find a way to connect with people who need us, to lead people forward, to weave something generous for the community?
And what if we chose to learn something? All the time not spent commuting or in meetings–a chance to dive deep into the work of McCoy Tyner, or to understand how probability works.
Even as we retreat from physical interaction, there’s a huge opportunity to actually connect, to learn and to understand.

When it’s chaos around here,"We have two choices:
We can buy into the stress, the noise and the craziness and make it even more chaotic. That’s certainly how it spreads. It feels like the right thing to do–to join in on the anxiety. But it’s not. In fact, the anxiety doesn’t help anyone, and probably makes it harder for those in need. If you’re needed, then help. But if you’re not, if the chaos will get worse if you amplify it, consider a different path.
The other path is to take this moment in time to dig deep and figure out what’s next. In the middle of every market interruption, someone starts building a new market. In the midst of a career adjustment, new careers are built.

"Uncertainty, risk and change","When the world changes, it’s easy to feel stressed. That’s because stress is wanting to do two things at the same time–stay and go.
When we’re surrounded by people who are also seeking control over an uncontrollable situation, it magnifies those feelings.
It’s okay, probably even helpful, to begin by clarifying the emotions that we’re feeling, especially when we’re apparently talking about something else. Panic is never a useful plan, and it’s even worse if it seems to be about something else.

The end of handshakes?,"In the future, of course, there are no handshakes. Star Trek, Star Wars, even Spaceballs… no one shakes hands.
And handshakes haven’t been the standard default for as long as we think–they were codified by the Quakers five hundred years ago, because they were thought to be more egalitarian than tipping a hat or bowing.
Today, of course, a handshake is often seen as a threat more than a disarming form of intimacy and equality.
In addition to being a vector for disease transmission, handshakes reward a certain sort of powerful personality and penalize people who might be disabled or uninterested in that sort of interaction. And judging people by the strength of their grip doesn’t make much sense anymore.
Until a week or two ago, demurring a proffered hand (how antiquated to use ‘demurring’ and ‘proffered’ in the same sentence) was seen as odd and a bit insulting. Today, it comes across as generous.
Add to this the fact that in a video call, there’s no way to shake hands. Hat tipping (or perhaps an informalVulcansalute or simply a smile and a wave) might be making a comeback.

The problem for freelancers,"Getting found.
No clients, no work.
And the clients have a problem as well: Figuring out who the truly good freelancers are.
A marketplace like Upwork is supposed to solve a classic two-sided problem like this one. But the problem is so difficult that marketplaces often make it worse (and charge too much as well).
They make it worse by pushing people to be bottom-fishing cheap commodity providers. If someone searches for ‘logo designer’, there is a huge amount of pressure to be the freelancer who checks all the boxes, has decent reviews and isalsothe cheapest.
The problem with that race to the bottom is that you might win. Compliance and commodity pricing can’t possibly work well for an independent freelancer, because there’s always someone cheaper than you.
And clients? Well, every once in a while a good client encounters a freelancer who is worth sticking with. The marketplaces, though, want to be sure to get paid for every hour worked, not simply surface the good ones. Upwork is trying to slip through a change in theirtermsof service (effective in four weeks) that will subject any client who hires a freelancer they found on their site to afineof up to $50,000–per freelancer. That’s not good for either the freelancer or the client.
The gig economy is based on the magic of finding the right person for the right job. It falls apart when it becomes a commodity marketplace in which each freelancer struggles to be valued for the work they are able to create.
For most freelancers, the hard part isn’t doing the work–it’s being tricked into believing that they have to be the lowest bidder to succeed.

Shared objective reality,"That’s not the only way we experience the world, and until relatively recently, it wasn’t even the dominant one.
The sun rose this morning. You don’t have to agree with me, but a stranger to our disagreement would confirm that it happened.
Objective reality is measured. It’s not based on talking points. It’s repeatable and verifiable.
When humans share an understanding of how things areobjectively, we’re able to make enormous progress, because this objective reality is consistent. It doesn’t matter which group we’re in, or who our leaders are. We don’t have to check with someone else before we can decide if what’s in front of us is true or not. So we can work together to build roads or bridges, to cure an illness or make an omelet.
Much of our life is actually driven byshared cultural realityinstead. This is what happens when ‘we’ all agree that brides wear white, or that squirrel isn’t worth eating. There isn’t a universal ‘we’, simply groups that define themselves that way. Shared cultural reality is essential to create harmony within groups, but it can drift over time, sometimes erratically, because the compass can change. It can change when leaders insist it does, and it can change in the face of other changes in the culture.
Our cultural and our objective realities overlap and often conflict. For example, too often, we’ve made the cultural decision that people of certain races, backgrounds or genders are somehow inferior. In the face of objective reality, the cultural reality is (too slowly) changing. Shared cultural reality can stick around for a long time, again because there’s no agreed-upon compass to point to. It’s surprising but likely true that the most devout cheerleader for a given cultural tribe would have been stoned as a heretic by that same group a hundred years ago. The context shifts.
Amplified by the media, divisions over this cultural reality are getting worse. Spin, widely spread, not only seeks to divide us on cultural issues, but resorts to insisting that the objective reality that is challenging those issues isn’t real. By seeking to deny the things we ought to be able to agree on, it sets us back.
The other two corners of 2 x 2 grid are:
Unshared objective reality. This is the scientist or scholar we call a genius. Someone who sees the objective truth before the others, who is pilloried and then celebrated for challenging the status quo we all will be abandoning one day soon.
Andunshared cultural reality. This is the artist, the poet or the offbeat person who is living with a different set of cultural rules than the rest of us.
The conflict of our time is between people who are challenging our shared objective reality by claiming that their shared cultural reality takes precedence over what we’ve discovered. And vice versa–objectivists who insist that cultural reality doesn’t matter. It does. It makes us human and helps us find meaning.
They’re different, but we need them both. One way to accomplish this is to not confuse them.
The banana is not a threat to the bicycle.

The paradox of selfishness,"Often, we choose to be selfish because we feel insufficiency.
“I don’t have that much, how can I possibly share it?”
The insecurity that comes from feeling like our foundation is weak or our future is uncertain can cloud our instinct to be generous. Like a drowning person, we cling ever tighter to the life buoy.
You see where this is going…
The single best way to find sufficiency and confidence and trust and forward motion is to do precisely the opposite of what our instincts might tell us.
In an economy based on connection, trust and attention, the posture of generosity is not only the highest-yielding strategy, it’s also the right thing to do.
Ideas shared go up in value. Doors opened turn into new opportunities for all.

Thoughts on a virus,"I’ve been studying digital media “viruses” for more than 20 years, and much of what we have discovered about them comes from the analogy to epidemiology and the behavior of real viruses.
Here are some ideas that might be relevant as we come to grips with a slowly unfolding tragedy, and help us with our fears and plans each day.
Viruses act like they are digital. A loud concert gets quieter as you move away from it. A chemical dumped in a lake gets diluted as it moves further from where it landed. But a virus starts fresh every time it infects someone else. Often, we act as if that’s not true. Even though it’s organic and living in our body, it’s a code, one that replicates fairly completely as it spreads. It evolves as it goes, but it also recharges with each new host.
Viruses are contagious.Epidemiologists measure R0, pronounced R-nought. It’s the measure of how many people a virus in one person will reach. An R0 of 3, for example, means that every person who gets it will infect three more people. Obviously, if the R0 stays above 1, it means that eventually, it will infect every single person. That never happens. What does happen is that the number shifts. When the measles is in an elementary school, it can have an R0 of 20. But, over time, as environmental and other factors come into play, it goes down. Right now, the R0 of Covid-19 is estimated to be between 2 and 3, though it might be higher than measured if there are a lot of mild or unreported cases. As you can see below, more than 2 is very high.
Viruses can spread when we don’t know we have the disease.(And of course, there’s an analogy here to malicious computer viruses). Of course, that’s not how memes and YouTube hits work, but it’s very relevant here. The virus has no intent, no goals, no desires, but viruses that spread tend to be viruses that are contagious when we don’t know it and that last a while. It increases their R0 because apparently healthy people walk around spreading the disease. Freaking out around someone who is coughing isn’t helpful, since there are plenty of people who aren’t coughing who may be almost as contagious.
There’s a difference between the impact of a virus and its virality.The measles are one of the most contagious viruses we know, and fortunately, they only seriously impact (or kill) a small percentage of the people they infect. Because they infect so many, though, it’s urgent to be vaccinated for measles… to prevent you, or the person you’ll infect next, from being a victim. Here’s a chart from a really helpful article in theTimes: (click to enlarge)

It’s very difficult to buy your way out of this.We’ve been trained that a good way to deal with emotional stress is to buy something, but there’s not much to buy. So far, it seems as though most healthy people will have an unpleasant time if they contract the virus, but with fluids and rest, will recover completely. It’s possible you’ll need medical help for pneumonia or perhaps access to oxygen supplements or a respirator, but there’s not very much you can have in your home that will help. However, if you meet the CDC’s definition of warranting medical evaluation—such as the presence of a new cough—it is best to call your doctor or local department of health. You may need to be tested, examined or treated.
Big numbers conceal the tragedy of the small ones. If 98% of the people who get a disease end up okay, that can still mean that hundreds of thousands or millions of people don’t do so well. The odds are definitely in your favor, but they’re still odds. There’s a slow-moving tragedy happening, and it’s going to impact people we care about.
The ideavirus in the media is preceding the actual virus’s arrival.That means we are experiencing the effects of this twice. Once, when we’re filled with fear of the unknown (with various entities fanning panic) and again when it actually arrives.
The R0 varies because of superconnectors and the places in which they hang out.They closed the Louvre for this reason—some people and some places dramatically amplify the average rate of spread of the virus.
A mask is not a good luck charm.Medical professionals know how to wear masks and use gloves and proper sanitation to prevent themselves from communicable diseases. Commercially available N95 masks don’t block particles as small as COVID viruses. Watching people walking through airports with their facemasks misadjusted, or touching a surface (the germs can last for days) makes it clear that this is talisman thinking, not actual prevention. Handwashing can work, particularly if it’s done often and well. [Update: it’s become clear that a mask is a good way to keep OTHER people from getting sick.]
The thing is, if every person on Earth was isolated for three weeks, we could be pretty confident that we could move on, but the world is a lot more connected than that. We’ve built a worldwide culture of connection, both digital and physical, and while we can slow down the spread of a virus, we can’t stop it.
There are so many things we can do to radically improve public health.Everyone can get fully vaccinated for childhood diseases and seasonal risks as well. That alone will save hundreds of thousands of lives a year. We can aggressively campaign against drunk driving and get people to stop smoking. We can clean up the environment and invest in clean water and adequate sanitation. That’s millions and millions of lives saved annually. Each of these problems will kill more people than this virus. It doesn’t pay to panic ever, and in a case like this, getting smart and making appropriate decisions is far more effective than going into a frenzy.
Wishing you and yours good health, peace of mind and a quick end to this.

"Self, community and motivation","Me & Now
vs.
Us & Later
This is the conflict every culture lives with. Modern industrialism has embraced the extraordinary power of instant gratification and has amplified it by reminding us that onlyyouknow what you want and need.
Fast food plus the me generation. What you want, when you want it.
Years ago, I co-authored apaperthat, if implemented would probably have solved our shameful shortage of available organs for donation. In prioritizing people who need a donation, we’d settle a tie by sorting people by how long they’d been on the donor registry. If you’re not willing to sign up to give (one day far in the future) then you don’t get priority to get (when you need it). The self-focused need to be on the list early would essentially eliminate the need for a ranking at all, because humans have been taught to do what helps them now before worrying about later or everyone else. Enough people would panic and race to be on the registry that the shortage would soon disappear.
In our culture, turning the “us and later” narrative (you should sign up for the registry to help a stranger one day) into “me and now” (better sign up today or you’ll regret it) is a generous hack. We shouldn’t have to do it, it’s less resilient, but it would work.
How then, did the media respond to public health officials to flatten the curve on the epidemic virus (not perfectly, not soon enough, but they did)? They didn’t appeal to, “you should do this to protect strangers from getting sick.” They tried but it didn’t work well enough.
They did it by implying, “if you touch someone, you will die almost instantly and quite horribly.” And people, already frightened, embraced the feeling.
People generally aren’t wearing masks and socially distancing out of long-term philanthropy and insight about resources and epidemiology. It’s happening because of the panic of self-preservation.
A rational, generous, community mindset was effectively replaced by an immediate and self-focused desire to be safe. A generous hack.
The selfish dolts onspring breakor inbouncycastles didn’t get that memo: they feel fine, why bother being careful?
A narrative of “save yourself right now’ is effective in this culture. In other cultures, less industrialized but hardly less sophisticated, an alternative could be a focus on “us” before “me.”
Without a doubt, short-term market needs are often efficiently filled by short-term selfish behavior. Resilience comes from a longer-term and more community-focused outlook.
The question is: Once people catch the virus and get through it (as most people will) and recover (as more than 9 out of 10 will), what will replace the selfish panic?
Cultural pressure is the sometimes unseen force that allows us to maintain civility. It helps us decide what to choose.People like us, do things like this.
As we face the need to pay for our recovery, for a new and more resilient safety net and for the shifts that our culture demands, will we have to resort to the short-term and the selfish yet again?

Thoughts on “I’m bored”,"If you’re under 14: “Good.”
It’s good that you’re feeling bored. Bored is an actual feeling. Bored can prompt forward motion. Bored is the thing that happens before you choose to entertain yourself. Bored is what empty space feels like, and you can use that empty space to go do something important. Bored means that you’re paying attention (no one is bored when they’re asleep.)
If you’re over 14: “That’s on you.”
As soon as you’re tired of being bored at work, at home, on lockdown, wherever, you’ll go find a challenge. You don’t have to quit your day job to be challenged, but you do have to be willing to leap, to take some responsibility, to find something that might not work.
Being challenged at work is a privilege. It means that you have a chance, on someone else’s nickel, to grow. It means you can choose to matter.

Average work for average people is going to be worth less than ever before.
Typical employees doing typical work are going to be less respected and valued than ever before.
And just as expectations are being shifted, new opportunities will arise. They always do.
So what’s next? A commitment to learning and to possibility.
The pandemic demonstrated, among other things, that we all have access to each other digitally. That if you want to learn something, the chance is there. That internet connections can be powerful, and that leadership is priceless.

Bulletins vs bulletin boards,"[Here’s a simple communications hack for small teams and organizations:]
When times are changing and you’re adjusting on the fly, it’s tempting to send another alert.
The rules at the farmer’s market, the latest schedule for a changing event, the status of a server…
When I was growing up in Buffalo, they used to announce school closings on the radio. Twice an hour, we’d huddle around and listen to an endless list of schools (mine started with a W), wasting everyone’s time and emotional energy.
The problem with alerts is that they don’t scale. They create noise. Every time you poke everyone with a bulletin, you’ve taken attention away with no hope of giving it back.
The alternative is the bulletin board.
Want to know how you did on the exam? Go look at the bulletin board. The grades will be posted when they’re ready.
Want to know the latest situation before you head out? Go look at the bulletin board.
Social media got everyone into the bulletin habit, but we left behind bulletin boards too quickly.
And in our digital world, you don’t need to be a computer programmer to have one. Simply create a shared Google doc. It’s free and it doesn’t crash and it’s low tech. (And yes, there are many alternatives that don’t come from big companies).
Give people the link to view the doc. Include it in your Facebook post or your last email on the topic. “Click here to see the latest updates.” Don’t worry about whether your tweet or post (a bulletin) moves down the screen, because everyone who cares already has the link to your bulletin board and you’ve trained them to check it when they want to know the status of your event or situation. It’s not a great choice for a high-traffic site, but if you’re trying to coordinate a few hundred people, it’s a lot easier than trusting social media.
And you can even share editing privileges with your core team, so there’s no bottleneck for updates. You don’t need to get a programmer out of bed in the middle of the night to update the school closing list. It’s a simple thing to update the bulletin board, to keep making it more up to date and complete as your situation changes.

What brings out the best in you?,"What brings out the worst?
One more question: Is it possible to adjust your life so that you show up more often in situations that bring out the best? Can you have an agenda, a rider or an itinerary that makes it more likely that the world around you is what you need it to be?
Because if you can’t, there’s one other option: Can you change your posture so that the situations you’re in a lot bring out your best instead of your worst?

“I tweaked a few things”,"The easiest way to get a contribution, advice or feedback is to present something that’s 90% done.
If you ask too early in the process, if you’re hoping for conceptual insights, you’ll probably be disappointed.
Human nature pushes the inexperienced feedback giver to wait until you’re almost done and then to offer feedback on little things. Tactics, not strategy. Colors, not shapes.
Which means that you either need to teach your team to be strategic professionals, able to give big advice early…
Or create enough room in your (private) internal schedule for redoing the work after someone has ‘tweaked a few things.’","April 24, 2020","feedback, contribution, strategic professionals"
New effort vs Old effort,"Here’s what you had to do to go to a conference in Toronto:
Get a passport • Register for the event •  Pack • Figure out how to get to the airport on time • Navigate the TSA • Find a hotel • Get to the event • (I left out about a hundred steps).
Here’s what you had to do go to a meeting in your office:
Own a car •  Maintain it • Deal with public transport • Risk your life driving to the office • Make sure the dry cleaning was picked up • Navigate evil Bob in reception • (I left out another 100 steps).
Andhere’s what you have to doto be a positive contribution on a Zoom call.
The difference is that the first two are expensive, complicated and difficult processes that we’re already used to, so they don’t count.
Part of the challenge of a worldwide shift is that all of us have to engage in new effort that we’re not used to. It’s nothing we asked for, and the old effort disappearing doesn’t feel like much of a benefit.
But, if new effort is required, we have the chance to do what we’ve always done, which is figure out what works and to commit to it.","April 23, 2020","effort, transition, engagement"
The Fremen principle,"If you want to know how to work with new or limited resources, find a population that’s used to not having many alternatives.
Of course Harvard and the others are terrible at distance learning. They’ve had four hundred years of in-person lectures, tenure, accreditation and a waiting list to lean on. Our tiny team atAkimbohas run circles around them online precisely because we didn’t have the advantages they do.
It’s no surprise that American car companies had trouble shifting to fuel-efficient small cars, because their DNA was about wide roads, cheap gas and growing markets. The Japanese had to make do with none of that.
And a home cook who’s used to the unlimited aisles of the modern supermarket isn’t sure what to do when there’s not much to choose from. An Italian grandmother is a better guide in that moment.
When we have alternatives, we compromise instead of commit.
Find someone who has already optimized for the reality you’re about to enter and learn from them.

The bootstrapper creates value,"The times are nothing remotely like that any of us would have predicted just a few months ago. And many of the institutions and jobs we depended on have changed, perhaps for a long time to come. It’s going to be a slog.
And as always, there will be the other side of the slog.
Where will the solutions be found? How do each of us choose to contribute?
Into this void, it’s possible to show up with something new, something you start, something that solves a problem.
One of the most powerful things you can do is build a useful business. An enterprise of value, doing work of substance, filling a need and finding independence.
And to do it without raising money from a bank or waiting in line for a venture capitalist to smile at you is where freedom can be found.
You’re not a bootstrapper because you are thinking small. You’re a bootstrapper because it offers a chance to chart your own course and to serve your customers without conflict.
Innovation almost always comes from individuals who see a chance to make things better. Instead of waiting, they go first.

Don’t know (can’t know),"If your career depends on detection and selection, it’s a helpful fiction to imagine that you’re doing something more than random guessing.
College admissions.
Greenlighting a movie.
Picking stocks.
Publishing a book.
The data makes it clear, though: while it’s possible to be worse than average at most of these selection tasks, it’s almost impossible to do consistently better than the average.
As William Goldman said, nobody knows anything.
It’s so much more honest (and efficient) for a selective college to send a letter to the people who meet basic criteria and say, “you’re good enough, but there aren’t enough slots, so we’re going to pick randomly.” Because the truth is that a randomly selected class of qualified people is going to be just as high achieving as any other combination they could create.

Beware of experience asymmetry,"There are things you’re going to do just once. Get your tonsils out. Pick a caterer for your wedding. Raise money from a venture capitalist. Apply to college.
In these situations, the institutions and professionals you’re dealing with have significantly more experience than you do. Not only that, but they know that you’ll be gone soon and they’ll still be around.
In these asymmetric situations, it’s unlikely that you’re going to outsmart the experienced folks who have seen it all before. It’s unlikely that you’ll outlast them either.
When you have to walk into one of these events, it pays to hire a local guide. Someone who knows as much as the other folks do, but who works for you instead.

On predicting the future,"Two things:
We do it all the time. Constantly.
We’re terrible at it.
We spend our days guessing how an action will impact the future, and we’re often wrong.
And we spend the rest of our days hoping we were right or worried that we weren’t. We try to control the future by telekinesis and anxiety in equal measure.
When the future doesn’t cooperate, we spend even more time trying to change the next bit of future so that it ends up more closely matching the future we were hoping for.
What if, instead, just for a little while, we simply did our best?
And let the future take care of itself.
Because even if we don’t fret, the future is still going to take care of itself.
All that’s on us is to do our best work. Paying attention to models and the community and the people we serve.","April 18, 2020","future, prediction, control"
The message and the messenger,"If your job is giving people good news, it doesn’t necessarily mean you’re doing a good job.
And the opposite is also true.
Often, we conflate the situation with the people involved, but that’s a trap. Our job isn’t to make people happy, it’s to create the promised change with care and professionalism.

"All models are wrong, some models are useful","That’s what makes it a model. The map is not the territory, and a model is nothing but a stripped-down approximation of what might be happening. By definition, the model for your problem, your organization, your opportunity–it’s not actually the thing being studied, it’s a simplified version of it.
At higher magnification, your model is wrong. It has to be in order for it to be a model.
And yet we need models.
We need a model because if the elegant, pure, refined model doesn’t work, it’s harder to understand why your messy, real-world situation is going to work.
Not all logical and structurally sound models turn into successes in the real world, but better to begin with something that makes sense.","April 16, 2020","models, approximation, understanding"
What do you make?,"It’s possible that your job is to make decisions.
If that’s what you do, what would it mean to do it more productively? With less hassle or drama?

Toward better,"There’s rarely a straight line from here to better.
But there’s usually an arc.
The slog won’t last forever.
And winning streaks aren’t endless either.
As we move through time, we’re often presented with opportunities that are carefully disguised as problems. And every day we’re forced to make a choice. The default might be to hold back, but it’s not the only option.
The chance to move toward better can become a habit.

Because it’s more comfortable to stay where we are.

You’re surrounded,"We all are.
Throughout a lifetime, everyone has their troubles–someone might have stubbed a toe, or missed a car payment or be studying for an upcoming exam. Big problems and small. We each have our fear, our grief, our hassle.
The thing is, the troubles were local and unique. It was easy to walk away from our drama, at least for a moment, because someone else, everyone else, had something else they were dealing with.
For the last month, that hasn’t been true. For anyone.
You can’t avoid it, can’t walk away from it and have to work to put it in perspective, because every interaction comes with someone else amplifying the story.
But…
At the same time the echo chamber around us magnifies our story, we also have the solace of knowing that truly, it’sus.
Us together.
The boat is really, really big and we’re all in it.

But the other voices, they matter too.
The marginalized ones who might not be invited to have a seat at the table.
The people who have a long-term view.
Folks who see and act on possibility and connection.
We hear what we focus on, and what we hear changes how we experience the world.

Monopoly and network effects,"Old-fashioned monopolies rely on some sort of coercion.
Perhaps you need to bribe FCC commissioners to avoid net neutrality, or simply influence a local board to permit you to, by law, be the only provider of cable.
Or perhaps you set up interlocking trusts that put a stranglehold on any competitors.
It’s not pretty, and left unchecked, it eliminates all of the benefits of free markets.
Modern monopolies, though, rely on the network effect. People want to join a social network because everyone else is already there.
When we see a monopoly that’s driven by network effects, it’s easy to be conflicted. Because, after all, network effects create real value. If there were ten different phone systems in 1962, calling someone else would have been almost impossible. AT&T seemed like a dream come true in comparison to that sort of chaos.
What’s missing from this analysis is that interoperability is more possible than ever. Companies that provide a conduit to the network can compete with one another fairly if none of themarethe network.
Networks, whenever possible, should be peer-to-peer, autonomous and not for profit. The network that delivered you this blog post is all three. There are sections along the way that people and organizations choose to pay for and that definitely make a profit, but the resilient internet, the thing that’s managed to stick around for decades, that has dealt with a huge surge in the last three weeks, outlasts each of them.
The community where we live works the same way. While there are businesses at various points along the path, our support and connection and the magic of the people who see us and care about us is inherently peer-to-peer, autonomous and not for profit. And it’s worth celebrating.","April 10, 2020","Monopoly, Network Effects, Interoperability"
But what could you learn instead?,"The other day, I was talking to a friend in college. He was complaining about a lousy class he was taking, one that was now significantly worse because it was online. I asked why he was even taking it, and he looked at me like I was nuts.
He’s in it for the education, not the learning.
A colleague, recently graduated from a famous college, told me about the regime of clickers, used to make sure that students actually come to class and don’t fall asleep while they’re there.
The degree is what’s on offer, not fundamental change.
For a semester, I taught at the esteemed Stern business school at NYU, regularly ranked in the top twenty of all business schools. In every class, students angled for a way to do less work and have less engagement. One skill they had mastered was relentlessly narrowing the scope of their responsibility.
Compare this to the courses I taught at Mercy College, a local community college where most of the students had day jobs or small businesses. In every single session, they demanded more from me. More insight, more learning and yes, more homework. They made me stay late after every class. The difference was stunning—they were there to learn something.
None of this is surprising once you see how we got here.
Labor struggles with management. Management wants people to put in more effort, and never has enough to be satisfied—because productivity goes up if there’s more output for less money. In response, labor goes on defense and pushes to do less, because if they don’t, management will simply use them up and toss them out.
Organized education was built on this same model.There is a regular regime of measurement and testing. There are promotions, demotions and the risk of failing out. And at the end, the prize is a certificate that proves to management that you’re a suitable candidate for labor.
Contrast this with the joy of creativity. Of making something magical. Of art.
The artist rarely says, “I’d like to do less.” Instead, she wonders how to contribute more, because the very act of creativity is the point of the work.
You can learn just about anything now. Thirty years ago, that statement was ridiculous. In just one generation, we put everything you need to know about anything you want to know just a click away. The hard part isn’t access to it, the hard part is finding a cohort and a system that helps you do it. Because learning comes from doing.
We talk about ‘learning’ as though it’s as easy and natural as shopping or watching or doing errands. But it’s not. It’s a commitment, one that we regularly make up excuses to avoid. Thissimple ideafrom John Smith, for example. Easy to imagine, not that easy to do. Because you’ll have to get good at it as you go. Learning doesn’t have to be expensive to work.
Learning takes effort, and it’s hard to find the effort when the world is in flux, when we’re feeling uncertain and when we’re being inundated with bad news. But that’s the moment when learning is more important than ever.
[This week, we’re launching the 40th session of thealtMBA. And for the people who signed up for it a few months ago, it will be a chance to actuallylearnsomething. Not to grind it out in search of a certificate, not to find a chance to do less, but to use the shift in our culture and the rhythm of our ideas to actually learn something.
Seeing the nearly 5,000 people around the world who have chosen to go on this journey together is thrilling. Year after year, we see the transformations, the shift in posture and possibility that happens after just a month. We’re looking for a few people to join us in July, I hope you’ll check it out.]
This shift is difficult to commit to, because unlike education, learning demands change. Learning makes us incompetent just before it enables us to grasp mastery. Learning opens our eyes and changes the way we see, communicate and act.
“What did you learn today,” is a fine question to ask. Particularly right this minute, when we have more time and less peace of mind than is usually the norm.
It’s way easier to get someone towatch–a YouTube comic, a Netflix show, a movie–than it is to encourage them to do something. But it’s the doing that allows us to become our best selves, and it’s the doing that creates our future.
It turns out that learning isn’t in nearly as much demand as it could be. Our culture and our systems don’t push us to learn. They push us to conform and to consume instead.
The good news is that each of us, without permission from anyone else, can change that.","April 9, 2020","Learning, Education, Creativity"

We’re looking for some students ready to leap forward. To shift from education to learning, from following to leading, from holding back to leaning in.

The lifelong fan,"What does it mean that for forty years you’ve been a steadfast and true fan of a team? The Red Sox, perhaps, or even the Montreal Expos.
Over time, every player has changed. Every coach. Perhaps the logo, the stadium, the city and even the name.
So, what, exactly, are you a fan of?
The same is true for car brands, political parties and just about anything where affiliation drives our sense of self and community.
People like us do things like this.
This instinct is so strong that we suspend disbelief (and create belief) based on something as shallow as what logo is on the box. We confuse our rational understanding of what’s important with our emotional connection to a logo or a team name. It turns out that the name of the team (and the other fans) are a much more important part of our narrative than we realize.
Part of being a fan isn’t insisting that your team win every game–in fact, being a fan is defined as showing up even when you’re losing, even when the leaders are wrong, even when logic dictates that this makes no sense at all.
Once you realize that being a fan is an important part of your self-worth, the most generous thing you can do is speak up when management is about to do something stupid. Because when the fans speak up, it’s possible that leadership listens.","April 6, 2020","fan loyalty, identity, community"

Acknowledgments 2020,"Authors get to put a page in their book thanking people who have quietly and persistently and generously helped.
But the page is rarely read, and it comes out infrequently and it’s not so timely.

I’m filled with gratitude for the healthcare workers who have shown up to do the jobs that they never hoped to have to do, risking so much to help people. From docs likeJodiwho are beginning their career in the middle of this, to retired nurses who are putting on their scrubs to help out again.
And thank you to the frontline workers and volunteers in my town and yours, from the food market to the fire department, from the gas station to the police. They’re showing up and doing it with grace.
Thanks to Zoom for dealing with a 20x increase in traffic and not missing a beat. Just like so many other tech companies that are quietly doing what they said they would do.
Thank you to the non-profit leaders, entrepreneurs and project managers who have figured out how to pivot on a dime, protecting the jobs of their teams and serving their customers in new and powerful ways.
Thanks to every parent who is at home with kids, balancing competing priorities and still being there for the ones who need them. And thanks to resilient and patient therapists, teachers and spiritual leaders who are figuring out how to be there, fully present, even if it’s on a video screen.
I’m grateful for the unseen but not anonymous people who are delivering packages, maintaining webservers, fixing the things that break and showing up every single day.
And I’m glad that so many people are ignoring the charlatans who are trying to profit from panic and untested remedies, preying on the fear that comes with a pandemic. And proud of anyone who stops clicking on a media channel that’s in the business of profiting from the attention that comes with amplifying that same fear.
I’m inspired by the team atAkimbo, working remotely from dozens of locations, shipping important work and connecting our extraordinary community of tens of thousands of people.
Thanks to my colleagues at Random Penguin and the rest of the book industry, for focusing on sharing insight and wisdom, simply because they know it’s important, not because it’s lucrative. And to my friends from all over, who are sheltering in place but sharing good vibes in so many ways.
And I’m grateful to you, loyal reader, for taking the long view, for leading, for spreading ideas that matter and showing up and doing work that you’re proud of. We wouldn’t have it any other way.
If you’re leading despite/because of what’s going on around us, thank you.

The semiotics of face masks,"It’s difficult to get adults to wear bicycle helmets. (Iwrote about thison the blog 16 years ago).
The reason has nothing to do with comfort or safety. It has to do with signals.
Semiotics is the science of flags, signals and other communications. It studies the very human act of judging something (or someone) based on limited information as we seek the message behind the signal, all in a quest for belonging and social standing.
Even more than helmets, face masks make a statement.
Ten years ago, if you wore a face mask at work, you were either a surgeon, a carpenter or a bank robber.
As they began to spread, mainly in parts of Asia, the mask was interpreted by some non-mask wearers as either a generous act (the wearer doesn’t want to infect others) or something slightly paranoid.
Then, when the pandemic first arrived in the US, masks became the focus of hoarding. Like toilet paper, it was a way to sacrifice time and money to get something scarce and reassuring. People weren’t reading scientific journals, they were grasping. The hoarding had the unfortunate side effect of keeping masks from front-line medical workers who needed them. It also created a sense of false security because many of the people who were using them had no clue how to use them properly, causing them to be worse off than if they hadn’t had them at all.
If you wore a mask on Main Street as you shopped in early March 2020, it was probably not increasing your social standing.
And then, as some newspapers shifted their stance and homemade masks began to appear, the story changes again–worth noting that even fast fashion has never changedthisfast.
And so the storytelling continues. “Why is that person wearing a mask,” the non-mask wearer asks themselves. Is it to shame me? To let me know that they’re ill and I should steer far away? Perhaps it’s a way of identifying them as anti-social, because, after all, I’m not wearing one… Or maybe they’re smarter than me and I’m behind?
The narratives may also be shifting from, “how do I protect myself?” which is a self-directed desire, to, “how do I keep others protected?” This is generally a hard sell in the world of the Marlboro Man, bespoke disposable water bottles and the Hummer.
Notice that none of these internal monologues have much to do with epidemiology or public health. The semiotics of social standing and cultural posture happen long before we actively consider the science.
Whether or not you choose to wear a mask, drive a Prius or even a pickup truck, it’s worth remembering that because we’re human, we start with two things: What’s the story I’m telling myself, and what’s the story I’m telling everyone else.","April 3, 2020","semiotics, face masks, social signals"
How would you like things to be?,"We know how things are. How could we not?
And we see the emotional rut that so many have fallen into as well.
The question is: Will you embrace an emotional posture that models how you’d like it to feel instead? Today, this day, we only get it once. How do you want today to feel on an emotional level?
It takes effort.
But it’s a choice.

It was a day that people on the internet understood that it’s possible to actas ifand to do it with a smile. To pretend that we’re not on the brink of apocalypse of one of twenty flavors, that nerds are clever now and then, and that most of all, that it’s worth taking a moment before we believe what we just heard and decide to freak out about it.
Alas, we’ve been fooled too many times for that to work any more.

Meeting spec (doing the minimum),"Two ways of saying the same thing.
If the bridge needs to hold 20,000 pound vehicles, the client isn’t interested in paying extra for you to build it to hold 30,000 pound vehicles. The spec is clear–15,000 is unacceptable, and 30,000 isn’t worth a penny extra in steel, concrete or pilings.
But when we’re bringing our human skills to the work, the spec for a job might state that we need to sit at the customer service counter from 9 to 5, but because “be really nice to people,” is hard to quantify it can feel like an extra if we’re seeking to do as little as possible.
Why do extra? After all, the industrial system has squeezed everything it can out of front-line workers. It has taken without offering much in return, stripping people of dignity and respect and treating them like cogs.
But acting like a cog in return is hardly a useful form of revenge.
Showing up with more than the minimum might turn the job into more than a job. When we show up because we can, when we’re extending ourselves as a matter of choice, we create space. The space to own the work, to personalize it, and to turn it into more than getting by.
The current crisis is a vivid reminder of how empty a job focused on getting by really is. Because getting by is a lousy way to spend our days. Playwrights, painters and committed professionals don’t ask, “how little can I get away with?” They view the work as a chance to make a difference instead.
Doing work we’re proud of is a fine alternative to being seen as less than human. And spending our days doing as much human work as we can is far more appealing than hoping to do as little as possible.","May 31, 2020","specifications, dignity, work ethic"
Applying effort,"How will you spend your resources? If you want to open a can of tomato juice, you can squeeze the sides of the can as hard as you can, for as long as you can, but it’s unlikely to open. You can also focus all of your energy on a very tiny point and perhaps, with the right tools, make a small puncture. But it won’t help you get the juice out. What you’ll need is a can opener, focusing your force at the right sized spot with the right pressure.
The same is true for the way we bring an idea to the world. One thing you could do is spam a billion people, once. Another is to identify a single individual and spend a year bringing this person just the right message, with relentless frequency.
You’re probably better off with something in between.
We can allocate our resources into a portfolio. Even if we don’t know precisely where to put the effort, a focus on the right categories pays off. Too often, we aim too wide (it feels more deniable). And sometimes, more rarely, we aim too narrowly.
Every day, we use our resources to make change happen. Which means that every day we get to choose.","May 30, 2020","resource allocation, focus, effort"
Leaky roofs,"In many situations, a leaky roof is worse than no roof at all.
If there’s no roof, we’re not surprised or disappointed if we get hit with some raindrops. But a roof that leaks has raised expectations and then failed to meet them.

Three paths for a soloist,"Consider one of three paths. Which works for you?

Dancing with tools,"How good are you at Google Sheets?
Can you write a query? A filter? Do you know how to install add-on tools to trim extra cells or create a mail merge? If you wanted to learn those things, do you know how to find out how?
It’s an interesting litmus test.
Sheets is free. It’s not particularly difficult to use. You can explore it in private, with no fear of screwing up. And it’s widely applicable to just about any career or community work you might choose to do.
The teenager across the street is far better off teaching herself Sheets than she is doing whatever busywork they’re handing her during the day.
If you get good at a type of technology, you’ll find yourself using it often. On the other hand, if you decide that you’re somehow untalented at it (which is nonsense) or don’t take the time, then you’ll have sacrificed leverage and confidence that were offered to you.
Of course, it’s not just Sheets, or the web, or even computers. It’s a posture of possibility when it comes to the tools we’re able to use.
We can ignore the tools that we have access to. We can fear them. We can understand them.
(And, after we understand them, we’re able to hire someone else to use them on our behalf.)
We can even master them.","May 27, 2020","Google Sheets, technology, learning"
Your defining moment,"It’s easy to wait for it. The movies have taught us that when the music swells and the chips are down, that’s when leaders arrive and when heroes are made.
It turns out, that’s not how it works.
Our work is what happens inallthe moments. Leadership doesn’t simply appear when the script announces it does: it is the hard work of showing up when we’re not expected to, of seeing what’s possible when few are willing to believe.
Your defining moment is whenever you decide it is, and you get a new chance to lead every day.
Two months ago, we ran our first session ofRising Talent, a special session of the altMBA by and for emerging leaders at Fortune 500 companies.
Our month-long sprint connected senior leaders from SAP, Starbucks, Dunkin’ Brands, Citi, General Mills, Lululemon, NBA, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Adobe, Audible, Barclays, Chipotle, Delta, Trane Technologies, Frost Bank, Kellogg Company, Kraft Heinz, MetLife, Qualcomm, Shopify, Slack and Warby Parker. Even though the world was already turning upside down, this extraordinary cohort showed up and did the work, even as they were contributing at a high level at their day jobs.
The results reinforced what we’ve been saying at the altMBA for the last five years. Possibility is where you find it. We each have more to offer than the world expects. And growth is something we’re capable of, as soon as we’re committed to seeing what we can contribute.
The secret of our workshops is the level of commitment that our students bring. Even in times of turmoil. Enrollment opens the door to action instead of compliance.
Our current worldwide tragedy is a slog, but it will have another side. And the organizations that thrive will be the ones that don’t rely on top-down management to go forward. It’s peer-to-peer leadership and innovation that produces resilience, and leadership that turns any moment into a moment where we can make things better.

Craftspeople and time,"Tell us when you’re going to finish.
Tell us if you fall behind.
Don’t make us ask.
It’s difficult for a small organization or a dedicated craftsperson to run an operation as punctually as a large bureaucracy. After all, the bureaucracy exists mainly to be sure that deadlines are honored and variances are not exceeded.
Your customers are aware of this. It’s one reason that they chose you–because you’re doing the work yourself, you’re a person, not an industry.
Don’t hide this unless you can hide it completely.
It’s amazing how much slack people will give you if you’re proactive about what you see and what you know. No need to make promises you can’t keep, and no need to hide from the promises you’ve made.

A small business isn’t simply a little version of a big business,"Fewer meetings, fewer resources, fewer constraints.
The biggest advantage that a small business has is that the owner can look customers in the eye. And vice versa.
Instead of policies, groupthink and leverage, the way forward for a small business might be the very thing that fueled you in the start: find out what people need and help them get it. Right away.
It’s never been easy to be a small business and it’s even more difficult right now. But resilience and flexibility go together.
The first rule remains: figure out what people need and bring it to them.","May 24, 2020","small business, resilience, customer focus"
A community of practice,"Learning happens mostly outside the classroom.
Learning is the difficult work of experiencing incompetence on our way to mastery.
And learning opens the door to identity.
When someone says, “I am a nurse”, they’ve taken their learning and certification, combined it with their livelihood and announced it as their identity.
And this all happens from community. The standards and practices, the support, the status roles.People like us do things like this.
If you’re a Maine wooden-boat builder, you do things a certain way. The ocean is the same water that a boat builder in Manila would put their boat on, but the boat is different because the community is different.
Even the way we think about formal education, accreditation and contribution is driven by the community of practice we are part of.
Communities have often been an accident of birth. Built by geography and parentage, you established your identity and your learning long before you went to school. Now, of course, this is changing.
Communities of practice have beenwrittenabout for decades, but they’re being transformed and amplified by the persistent and permeable nature of the net. When we surround ourselves with a community, it’s inevitable that it changes our identity.
Too often, we choose our community by default. The social network sucks us in, or we’re picked for a certain dodgeball team or cadre at school. We have the chance, though, to do it with intention instead.
I’ve come to realize that the circles that we’re building atAkimboare in fact communities of practice. A powerful, productive identity that people can choose to seek out.Click hereto see a preview our next one–for people who are ready to write.

Waiting and worrying,"It’s easy for us to choose to worry. The world is upside down, the slog continues, a tragedy unevenly but widely distributed.
Worry takes a lot of effort. And worry, unlike focus, learning or action, accomplishes nothing of value.
And, at the same time, due to the time-horizon of the pandemic, it’s also tempting for us to simply wait. To wait for things to get back to normal. But all the time we’re spending waiting (for a normal that is unlikely to be just like it was) is time we’re not spending learning, leading and connecting.
Waiting is, sort of by definition, a waste of time. But time is scarce, so wasting it is a shameful act.
If we decided to simply reduce our waiting and worrying allocation by 50%, just imagine how much we could discover, how many skills we could learn, how dramatically attitudes could shift.
We can still wait (even though time will pass either way). And we can still worry (even though it doesn’t do any good). But perhaps we can figure out how to do it less.","May 22, 2020","worrying, waiting, productivity"
Smart-adjacent,"You may have seen the miracle sudokuvideothat spread this week–a good sort of virus, one based on an idea. About half a million people have watched Simon spend nearly half an hour solving a puzzle. No anger, no violence, no innuendo. Merely applied thinking about numbers.
How did it spread?
There are millions of people who aren’t doing important medical research, creating (or solving) fascinating puzzles or writing breakthrough Broadway shows–but who are eager to find and amplify these ideas.
Culture is created by these amplifiers.
“People like us talk about things like this.” A good idea isn’t worth much if it doesn’t reach people who can benefit from it.
Instead of the quack doctor who goes on TV in a craven attempt to be famous at any cost, they’re willing to be the patient, thoughtful doctor who reads the research and shares useful information, even if the ratings aren’t as high. This is the long-term influencer who earns the trust of a small circle of people. Mostly, it’s people who care enough to model the behavior they’d like to see from those around them.
Three days ago, Google once again used its monopoly power and opaque methods toshut downa much-beloved podcast app for ridiculous reasons. Only the outcry from smart-adjacent voices got them to back down. We get what we talk about and we talk about what we pay attention to.
Or consider this 14-minute documentary about howHarley-Davidsonhas relentlessly made bad decisions in serving its customers. Nearly a million people have watched it (that’s as many as a typical cable TV show) because people who didn’t make it cared enough to spread it.
We keep seeing proof that cable news and other media don’t simply report the culture, they create it. Each of us now has our own microphone and network, and we get to decide what to program and what to consume.
It turns out that spreading the news about things that are smart is, in itself, smart.","May 21, 2020","smart culture, amplifiers, influencers"
“I’ve dealt with this before”,"There’s a huge gulf between earned expertise and strong opinion.
Knowing what others who have come before have done (and having successfully done it yourself) is demonstrably more effective than simply acting as if your opinion matters. Whether you’re dealing a lawsuit, cancer or a sous vide machine, you’re better off talking with someone who has earned their experience.
There’s a reason that there are very few loud amateur locksmiths. Either the lock opens or it doesn’t. Untrained voices tend to reserve their work for endeavors in which the results are either difficult to measure or happen far in the future.","May 20, 2020","expertise, experience, opinion"
Pique blindness,"If you can study something behavioral on college students, you can bet it gets studied a lot. It’s easy and cheap to run these sorts of tests. Which is how we came to understand the power of pique and the risk of habituation.
It turns out that if you see something over and over again, you start to ignore it. And so marketers of all stripes work to pique your interest by making funky little adjustments. They’ll change the speed limit to 57, or hang a sign upside down. In one study, they found that a scientist dressed as a panhandler raised more money when he asked for 37 cents instead of a quarter. (No word about what happens when a panhandler dresses like a scientist.) And so, selfish marketers will put ʇuǝƃɹn in the subject line of an email that couldn’t be less urgent…
This leads to pique blindness.
Just as bright white snow can overwhelm our retina so we can’t see very well, all of this pique to fight habituation has a downside. It’s creating a culture of hustle and noise that only gets worse. Because then people start using pique blindness as an excuse for ever more pique.
One of the real dangers of pique blindness is that we’ll only end up seeing drama, breaking news and the crisis of the moment. The first thing we need to do is not bite the hook. Refuse to reward anyone or anything that uses pique to get your attention. Turn up the filters and walk away. The important stuff will get through even if we filter out some of the urgent.
Even more important: asJonisaid, “you don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone.” Maybe what we need to do is invest daily effort in creating pique around the good things, the important things, the things we treasure. It could be as simple as breaking our pattern, coming up with a new way to walk the dog or greet a friend… It might involve breaking a habit in which a delight has become nothing much more than a comfort.
Everyone gets 24 hours of fresh attention, refilled daily. But if we continue to abuse it, we won’t be able to see with fresh eyes and appreciate what’s been there all along.

Alternatives to perfect,"“If I can’t make it perfect, is it okay if I try to make it better?”
When a project doesn’t come out precisely the way we hoped, when customer service isn’t 100%, when the reality doesn’t match the dream, then what?
One option is to embrace your failure. To have your tantrum, to become bereft, to wallow in how unfair the world is. No sense messing up a perfect moment of imperfection.
The other option is to put some effort into making an imperfect situation a little less imperfect. Perhaps, with some distance, it might even be a lot less imperfect, or even better than you were hoping for in the first place.
Imperfect is a chance for contribution, connection and improvisation. It’s a chance to see the humanity behind the moment you were spending so much energy creating.
The alternative toperfectmight bebetter.

But what if it works?,"The difference between science and conspiracy theory/superstition is simple:
Good science leads to useful insights. And good science is the cure for bad science.
On the other hand, there are no good conspiracy theories, because they are attractive precisely because they’re unproven, imprecise and non-falsifiable. They’re not actually theories at all. They use confusion to create a sense of comfort and control when it’s in short supply.
It’s almost impossible to tell a good conspiracy theory from a bad one, hence they don’t work as theories.
And good conspiracy theories don’t lead to useful insights, nor do they help drive out the bad conspiracy theories. You can’t productively question someone’s superstition, because it never really thought it was an actual explanation of how the world is.
A good scientist has a theory and she’s eager to be proven wrong, so she can make better science. And delighted to be proven right, because she now has a useful insight.
Reality doesn’t care whether or not we believe in it, but it’s more useful for all of us when we understand it.","May 17, 2020","science, conspiracy theory, insights"
Bridges and tunnels,"Robert Moses, the road builder, understood that that building tunnels takes just a little longer and costs just a little bit more.
And it turns out that bridges are monuments and create glory for those that find the resources to build them, there in the sky, for all to see.
Those are the two reasons why we end up with more bridges than tunnels. (Same is true with work culture and society at large).
But tunnels allow all sorts of productivity without calling attention to themselves or those that build them. A tunnel creates progress without changing the landscape. Many times, it’s an elegant solution to the problem for someone with the guts and fortitude to build one.
Less glory, more upside.

The moral imagination,"What do you dream of?
We’ve worked overtime to create a sports imagination. Kids dream of dunking a basketball or scoring the winning goal at the World Cup. That’s a pretty new phenomenon. Instant replay, endorsement deals and trading cards make it easy to imagine.
We’ve certainly established a profit imagination. Everywhere we turn, the p&l mindset isn’t far away. Add a zero. That’s winning.
And there’s a health imagination as well. The ideal of fitness and well-being, the very nature of an immune system that we’re supposed to support.
But what about the moral imagination?
Visualizing what’s possible. Deciding to do something about it. Wondering (to ourselves and then to the world, “how can I make this better?”)
Not because it’s our job or because we’ll win a prize. Simply because we can.
We can start where we are and we can make things better.

When is it too soon?,"If we’re holding back because we think someone (or the culture) might not be ready to give us what we want, it’s probably a good instinct. Nobody likes to be hustled.

And there’s a story at the heart of it,"What did we just tell ourselves about what happened?
And why do we choose to take the actions we take?
How does that narrative change the way we’ll deal with tomorrow?
Lots of things can trigger a change–some local, some global. But once a change occurs, the ripples that spread are almost always in the form of a story.
It’s a story that causes us to change our minds, to take action and to tell the others.
We don’t know what that book or that project is like until we experience it, but we have to decide now, so we tell ourselves a story. We must make a decision about how to engage with a stranger before we get to know them, and we do that by telling ourselves a story as well.
It’s on us to find, spread and ultimately create better stories. We aren’t passive consumers, dandelions in the wind. We’re active agents in what the people around us believe and what they do.

Clusters,"Marketers used to have little choice. The only marketing was local. The local neighborhood, the local community.
Mass marketing changed that. Now, the goal was to flip the culture, all at once. Hit records, hit TV shows, products on the end cap at Target and national TV ads to support it all.
With few exceptions, that’s being replaced by a return to clusters.
The cluster might be geographic (they eat different potato chips in Tucson than they do in Milwaukee) but they’re much more likely to be psychographic instead. What a group of people believe, who they connect with, what they hope for…
The minimal viable audience concept requires that you find your cluster and overwhelm them with delight. Choose the right cluster, show up with the right permission and sufficient magic and generosity and the idea will spread.

Seeing dominance and affiliation in politics,"In my most recentbook, I helped people see how we’re always tracking status roles in the way we make decisions. Who’s up and who’s down? What does this interaction or this purchase do to maintain or change my role?
It comes down to “who eats lunch first” and the instinct has been around since the savannah.
One place we see this really clearly is in world politics. Some candidates personify affiliation (who is with me/how are we working together) while others depend on dominance to gain and exert power (who am I defeating).
Jimmy Carter was an affiliation president. It was important to him to be in sync and to build alliances while diminishing conflict. Winston Churchhill was primarily a dominator, and using that posture, he built alliances that saved the UK in World War II.
Likability isn’t always related to this choice of dominance vs affiliation, but it’s often more difficult for a dominator to be seen as likable at the same time.
In many settings, dominance can be seen as bluster (if it’s on the surface only) or bullying (when applied in settings of unequal power).
In a world of fast media cycles, we seeagain,againandagainthe easy optics of domination. Professional wrestling is a sport of nothing but dominance–it’s a theater of status. And as we strip away the long-term from discussions of politics, Twitter and the rest of the chattersphere has created a similar theatre for politics.
In the short run, this is satisfying, because people get to feel as though their avatar, the leader who represents them, is moving up, which of course means that they’re moving up as well.
Even without a pandemic, the game theory of this short-term measure is flawed. Because in sports, not every team makes it to the finals, and not every wrestler becomes the world champ. And in politics, the repercussions of non-cooperation can last for generations.
Bluster is hard to maintain in places where performance is easy to measure. And so it tends to move to places where it’s not as easy to measure output.","May 9, 2020","politics, dominance, affiliation"
And when does it get boring?,"Almost no one who takes an intro to economics course becomes an economist. One reason might be that within a few days of starting the class, it becomes abstract, formula-based and dull.
The same ennui kicks in for having to memorize things in chemistry or world history.
We don’t have these fields because we need to employ professors. We have them because they give us a chance to understand and to figure things out. Once you are enrolled in the journey of discovery, decoding a formula or engaging with a taxonomy becomes urgent, not merely an assigned task.
Because a testing regime is in place, particularly now when so many other tropes in the education-industrial complex are disrupted, the textbook authors and administrators work together to skip the ‘fluff’ and go straight to the stuff that’s easy to test.
That’s not how passion is discovered or nurtured. No one becomes a baseball fan because they read the baseball textbook and did well on the baseball test. The same goes for people who devote their lives to cooking, leading or healthcare. These are journeys that require emotional enrollment, not a good test score. We need to stop holding the future hostage in exchange for an exam.

Freedom of choice brings with it the realization that our choices belong to us. One is the choice to lead. The other is the choice to follow.

A situation vs a slog,"“Wake me when it’s over,” is a natural instinct during a short-term interruption in our usual pattern. A crisis is there to be managed or waited out. The goal of each day is to simply get through it. Until things are back to normal.
But sometimes we’re dealing with a slog. Where the number of days is not small enough to simply throw them away. In a slog, the pattern of only getting by undervalues our days and diminishes our ability to contribute.
During a slog, we have a chance to accept a new normal, even if it’s temporary, and to figure out how to make something of it. You don’t have to wish for it, but it’s here. There’s very little value in spending our time nostalgic for normal.

Reality as an organizing principle,"Mathematicians don’t need to check in with the head of math to find out what the talking points about fractions are this week.
That’s because fractions are fractions. Anyone can choose to do the math, and everyone will find the same truth.
Most of the progress in our culture of the last 200 years has come from using truth as a force for forward motion. Centralized proclamations are not nearly as resilient or effective as the work of countless individuals, aligned in their intention, engaging with the world.
We amplified this organizing principle when we began reporting on progress. If you’re able to encounter not just local truth but the reality as experienced by many others, collated honestly, then progress moves forward exponentially faster.
Show your work.
One of the dangers of our wide-open media culture of the last ten years has been that the signals aren’t getting through the noise.
Loud voices are drowning out useful ones. It’s difficult to determine, sometimes, who is accurately collating and correlating experience and reality and who is simply making stuff up as a way to distract us, to cause confusion and to gain influence.
I’m betting that in the long run, reality wins out. That the practical resilience that comes from experimentation produces more effective forward motion.

How many moons?,"How many moons in our solar system? With 8 or so planets, how many moons in total?
My guess, when challenged, was 22. I figured Earth had one, rounded up, etc.
It turns out that it’s more than 200. Saturn alone has more than 80 moons.
That’s a common mistake. We make it all the time. We assume that our neighborhood is like every neighborhood, that our situation and experience is universal.
That’s rarely true.
Embracing that on the path to empathy is a powerful step forward.","June 28, 2020","moons, solar system, empathy"
The stolen address book,"I used to ask, “If you stole Steven Spielberg’s address book, would it help you get a movie made?”
The point was that even if you had the phone numbers and names, calling them up and saying you’d stolen them wasn’t worth very much. The data has no value without trust and connection.
Now, twenty years later, all the address books have been stolen. Everyone has all the data. Identifying the right people (or spamming everyone) is easy and cheap.
Which makes the point even more urgent than ever: Without trust and connection, access to data is worthless.","June 27, 2020","trust, connection, data"
Useful explanations of reality,"If we want to understand what’s going on around us, it’s helpful to be able to formulate a resilient story, one that holds up to scrutiny and allows us to make an impact.
That story shouldn’t change based on who’s in charge.
Which means that we don’t have to ask the head of the chemistry department why a reaction occurred. The theory works fine even if they’re not around.","June 26, 2020","reality, understanding, resilient story"
Everybody else,"It’s natural to believe that everyone else is as confident, assured, long-term thinking and generous as you are on your very best day.
But that’s unlikely. Because everyone else is probably not having their best day at the same time.
Once we realize that the world around us is filled with people who are each wrestling with what we’re wrestling with (and more), compassion is a lot easier to find.","June 25, 2020","compassion, confidence, understanding"
Should schools reward skills or talent?,"Talent is something you’re born with.
Skill is something you earn.
Skill comes from commitment and practice and self-discipline. The skill of earning skills is a lifelong advantage.
Without a doubt, encouraging kids to leverage their talents is a skill. And yet…
Who gets to be the center of the kids’ volleyball team–the tall kid or the one who practices the most diligently and brings the most teamwork to the game?
Who gets an ‘A’ in math–the one who can breeze through the tests or the student who asks intelligent questions and challenges the assumptions?
Who gets into a fancy college…
You get the idea.
Leaders talk about developing real skills and encouraging people to develop into their full potential, but too often, we take the short-term path of betting on raw talent instead. And of course, what looks like raw talent might not be. It could simply be our confusion about first impressions compared to the power of commitment, enrollment and persistence.","June 24, 2020","skills, talent, education"
Voices vs. noise,"If it’s not relevant, it’s noise. If it’s untrusted, unwelcome or selfish, it’s noise.
But your contribution isn’t noise. Not for the right people, at the right time.
The internet isn’t a mass medium. The voices online are not for everyone, it’s not the Super Bowl or M*A*S*H or even the nightly news. Nobody reaches much more than 1% of the audience on any given day.
But…
That tiny slice that does want to hear from you, that needs to hear from you, that would miss you if you don’t speak up–for that audience, you’re not noise. You’re essential.

What’s at the front of the line?,"Astudyof behavior at breakfast buffets showed that the first item in the buffet was taken by 75% of the diners (even when the order of the items was reversed) and that two-thirds of all the food taken came from the first three items, regardless of how long the buffet is.
This means that optimizing marketers usually put the things they most want to sell first.
And that smart consumers benefit from adopting patience as they consider what’s on offer.
Of course, this game theory applies to a lot more than food.","June 22, 2020","buffet behavior, consumer decision-making, game theory"
Picky vs difficult,"Picky people have consistent preferences and standards.
Difficult people change their preferences frequently, and often in response to who is presenting to them or the mood they’re in.
It’s pretty easy to figure out which makes for a better client or colleague.","June 21, 2020","Picky, Difficult, Preferences"
“That’s a good idea”,"“And then what happens?”
Repeat the second question 100 times. Because after every good idea, there are at least 100 steps of iteration, learning, adjustment, innovation and effort.
Starting with the wrong idea is a waste of energy and time.
But not committing to the 100 steps is a waste of a good idea.
We put a lot of pressure on the idea to be perfect because it distracts us from the reality that the hundred stepsafterthe idea are going to make all the difference. Nearly every organization you can point to is built around an idea that wasn’t original or perfect.
The effort and investment and evolution made the difference.","June 20, 2020","iteration, innovation, effort"
Too long delayed,"Today is Juneteenth, a holiday that should be more widely observed.
It doesn’t mark the date of Lincoln’s proclamation that freed enslaved people, nor does it occur on the day that the 13th amendment was passed. Both were overdue and urgent and important steps forward. Instead, it commemorates the day that a last group of enslaved people (outside of Galveston, TX) heard that they had been freed years earlier.
Holidays are symbols. They can cause us to pause for celebration or grief, for togetherness or simply to smile. Holidays are worth recalling because they give us a chance to connect and recommit to an idea that matters to us. This is a holiday about freedom delayed.
Change is hard, but delaying what’s right is toxic. Today we can remember just how much we have to do and realize the ability each of us has to see and alter the systems around us.
Not simply today, but every single day. A chance to make things better.","June 19, 2020","Juneteenth, freedom, social change"

The dominant culture,"One of the great cartoons involves two goldfish in a tank talking to one another. One responds in surprise, “wait, there’s water?”
When we don’t see the water, it’s a sign we’re benefitting from being part of the dominant culture.
And since we’re not fish, we can learn to see the water and figure out how it is affecting us and the people around us.
Visit a country where they don’t speak English and you’ll probably remind yourself all day that you speak English, something you didn’t have to think about last week. You’ll have to work overtime to understand and communicate. Back home, that stress disappears.
Living within a dominant culture means being reminded of this all day, every day.
When media images, policies and corporate standards tell someone that they are an outsider who needs to fit in in non-relevant ways, we’re establishing patterns of inequity and stress. We need to be clear about the job that needs to be done, the utility we’re seeking to create, but not erect irrelevant barriers, especially ones we can’t see without effort.
Good systems are resilient and designed to benefit the people who use them.
If the dominant culture makes it harder for people who don’t match the prevailing irrelevant metrics to contribute and thrive, it’s painful and wasteful and wrong.
It’s becoming more and more clear to me how much ‘water’ there is in the world I live in. Much of it is needless and counterproductive. Unfair, too. It will take an enormous amount of effort and persistence to reduce it. I’m working hard to see it. Because it’s everywhere.","June 17, 2020","dominant culture, inequity, resilience"
Creation/recognition,"If you buy an old painting at a garage sale for $1,000 and then sell it for $25,000, was the change in value due to a change in the magic involved in the creation of the painting, or is it because the market now recognizes the painting for what it is (and was all along)?
When Alta Vista refused to pay a million dollars to buy Google, was the problem in the value of what Google had, or in Alta Vista’s recognition of that value?
There’s often a significant lag between the creation of something useful and when the market recognizes it.
That’s an opportunity for speculators and investors, who can buy before the recognition happens.
And it’s an opportunity or a trap for creators, who might get disheartened about the lack of applause and upside immediately after they’ve created something.
When we look to the outside world for valuation and recognition, we might be confused about the intrinsic value of what we just created. Over time, those things may come into alignment, but that’s rare indeed.
Creation plus persistence can lead to recognition. But creation without recognition is still a worthwhile endeavor.

Worthy adversaries and useful allies,"Change happens more efficiently when we have both.
Often, they’re not individuals. It could be a status quo or a system.
In the early days of the Mac, Jobs chose Microsoft to be Apple’s adversary. But keeping the focus on them too long was an expensive and distracting mistake.
An adversary focuses the mission, but it also gives agency and leverage to the opponent.

Krulak’s law,"The experience people have with your brand is in the hands of the person you pay the least.

Invisible insulation,"I didn’t spend any time yesterday worrying about being eaten by a grizzly bear. Or that I would get cholera from the water in my house.
Over time, we’ve built layers of insulation between ourselves and the world.
Shoes make it easier to walk around. We can put one foot in front of the other without constantly scanning for rocks or rusty nails.
This invisible insulation is a form of civilization.
And when it’s unevenly available, it becomes privilege. Just as invisible sometimes, but to make things better, we need to look at it and realize that it’s there and do something.
If other people have shoes, it doesn’t make your shoes less functional. But if they don’t have shoes, then everything else they contribute (to you, to me, to everyone) is going to be different.
We’ve done a shameful job in failing to offer insulation widely. Access to health care. Clean water. Good schools. Freedom of fear from state violence. And the benefit of the doubt, which is easy to overlook. Because it all adds up, every day, for generations.
It’s almost impossible to make a list of all the things I didn’t have to worry about yesterday. We need to work overtime to make that true for more people.","June 12, 2020","insulation, privilege, access"
Fill in the blanks,"150 years ago, the periodic table of the elements was published.
It’s a truly stunning achievement because it predates the electron microscope. It’s a bit like labeling all the colors in a box of crayons in a world with nothing but very dim light.
Once the structure of the table was understood, its creator Dmitri Mendeleyev had a problem. Some of the elements that needed to be on it hadn’t been discovered yet. He knew that something needed to fill a slot, but he wasn’t exactly sure what.
And so he left the square blank.
Which inspired other scientists to go looking for what was needed to fill in that empty slot.
Much of the innovation of the internet has worked this way. As well as developments in urban planning, civil society and small business as well.
Once you see the grid, you can see the empty boxes. And then go fill them.

Which bridges?,"The head of the Long Island ParkwaytoldRobert Moses, “Legislation can change, but it’s very hard to tear down a bridge once it’s up.”
What he meant, what the notoriously racist Moses understood, was that once the systems are in place, they defend themselves. The roads of Boston have all outlasted the buildings. The buildings get razed and rebuilt, but the byways and thoroughfares remain, because the system demands far more effort to change than the road ever did to get built in the first place.
The irony of the word ‘bridge’ in this sentence is profound. Because when we say bridge, we usually mean a connection, or a way to move forward. And while these metaphorical bridges are far more fragile than the stuff Moses built, they’re worth building too.
Because one way to change systems is to start building connections and tunnels and yes, bridges, that make the old ones shift.

Getting what the customers asked for,"Why is there so much short-term hustle? Because that’s what we buy.
Why is there so much negative campaigning? Because that’s what changes our actions.
Why is social media filled with manipulation and vanity? Because that’s what we click on.
We buy foods that are engineered to make us fat and we watch shows that are designed to numb us instead of inspire.
Not all of us, not all the time.
It’s not our fault alone. The gears in the system are too often turned by short-term profiteers and people who seek to manipulate us for their own ends. They need to own the responsibility for their selfishness and not blame us for it. Leadership requires a commitment to make things better. Don’t blame the market.
But the system is extraordinarily sensitive to what we click, what we buy and what we talk about. If we can do the difficult and heroic work of acting differently, the system can tell. As soon as we shift to long-term thinking, the market will too.
The same thing can happen to our culture if we can shift our timeframe and our focus.","June 9, 2020","Short-term hustle, manipulation, long-term thinking"
Without ambiguity: Black Lives Matter,"This isn’t a current events blog. It might be inspired by them, but I try to write something every day that’s worth reading in a month or a year.
And so, I choose to ignore the specifics of breaking news, because breaking news keeps changing.
Sometimes, though, ambiguity isn’t called for. Sometimes, it’s misunderstood. In my town and my city and my country, we’re coming to grips with issues that have been simmering for far too long. And you’ve certainly heard from people with clear and actionable things about what you can do right now, and about their commitment going forward. I don’t want to confuse anyone about my take on it.
Avoiding breaking news is a privilege that I have, because there’s insulation for me.
Black Lives Matter.
The systemic, cruel and depersonalizing history of Black subjugation in my country has and continues to be a crime against humanity. It’s based on a desire to maintain power and false assumptions about how the world works and how it can work. It’s been amplified by systems that were often put in place with mal-intent, or sometimes simply because they felt expedient. It’s painful to look at and far more painful to be part of or to admit that exists in the things that we build.
We can’t permit the murder of people because of the color of their skin. Institutional racism is real, it’s often invisible, and it’s pernicious.
And White Supremacy is a loaded term precisely because the systems and their terrible effects are very real, widespread and run deep.
The benefit of the doubt is powerful indeed, and that benefit has helped me and people like me for generations. I’m ashamed of how we got here, and want to more powerfully contribute and model how we can get better, together.
It doesn’t matter how many blog posts about justice I write, or how clear I try to be about the power of diversity in our organizations. Not if I’m leaving doubt about the scale and enormity of the suffering that people feel, not just themselves, but for their parents before them and for the kids that will follow them.
It’s easier to look away and to decide that this is a problem for someone else. It’s actually a problem for all of us. And problems have solutions and problems are uncomfortable.","June 8, 2020","Black Lives Matter, systemic racism, accountability"
Don’t give up,"When is it time to give up, to stop trying, to settle for what is?
Five years ago, when I founded the altMBA, I had no idea what 2020 would be like. I don’t think anyone could have described the confluence of events, the unevenly distributed tragedy of our times, the injustice, the hurt and the illnesses as well. The despair that’s around us is real, and it has exposed many of the fault lines we’ve been papering over.
Leadership is needed. People, regardless of where they are or what they do, who can help those they work with move forward.
What else to do but to seek to make things better? Start where you are and do everything you can.
Today, the hard work of leading, asserting, connecting and contributing seems incredibly difficult. But it’s more urgently needed than ever. Right here and right now.
When we ran the first session of our thirty-day virtual workshop, it was something that had never been done before. We had to explain what Zoom was, had to describe a future where online learning was not only possible, but could be transformative, and had to invent a whole new way for people to connect and learn with each other. But, truthfully, we had no idea. It was an experiment, and the 100 people who took that first session knew that, and were eager to give it a try.
We just finished our fortieth session. We’ve had graduates from 16 to 80 years of age. In 77 countries. Leaders from some of the biggest companies in the world as well as people who run non-profits, play professional sports or paint. Because making things better isn’t about what you look like or where you work. Making things better is an attitude. The attitude of possibility and the posture of generosity. And then making the decision to own yourlearning.
Don’t stop speaking up, don’t stop leading, don’t stop learning. Don’t stop seeking justice. We can’t give up.
Today is our five-year anniversary. 40 sessions, hundreds of coaches, thousands of alumni. And we keep showing up because you keep showing up. You do it with grace and kindness and confidence, even when the world is turned upside down. If you’re suffering from a hardship right now, know that we’re thinking of you.
It’s not a good time for us to celebrate our anniversary. It’s difficult to even share the news. So many people in our community and on our team are going through tough times right now, experiencing a world that they never asked for or expected. The best instinct I have in moments like these is to help people choose to lead. To do even better work on the projects you care about. To show up and to lean in and to contribute. In whatever way you can.

Listening is difficult,"Hearing happens when we’re able to recognize a sound.
Listening happens when we put in the effort to understand what it means.
It not only requires focus, but it also requires a commitment to encountering the experience, intent and emotion behind the words. And that commitment can be scary. Because if we’re exposed to that emotion and those ideas, we discover things we might be avoiding.","June 7, 2020","Listening, Understanding, Emotion"
The truth about rubylith,"Before desktop publishing, the best way to layout a complicated image for printing was to cut a rubylith.
Rubylith is a translucent sheet of thin plastic. A craftsperson would carefully cut the ruby, knowing that the parts it covered would reflect the light when the plate was created. It was difficult and painstaking work.
That’s all obsolete now. An hour of cutting a ruby is replaced by two clicks in Illustrator.
Here’s the truth: images cut by hand with a rubylith weren’t better. They were simply the best available option.
As soon as technology allowed people to skip this step, many of them did. The others fought hard, pointing out that their craft was hard-won and that the old way was the better way.
Defending your particular rubylith skill is not really a winning strategy. Because everyone else doesn’t care.
Defending better, on the other hand, is truly important.","June 6, 2020","rubylith, desktop publishing, craftsmanship"
Average is not the same as typical,"We know that the median is often not the same as the mean, but in describing a population, it also pays to differentiate between the average person and a typical one.
For example: The average dog owner spends $500 a year on dog food. But the typical dog pamperer spends $5,000 a year (all numbers invented).
The reason the numbers are different is that the samples are different. We chop off the outliers in the second set, homing in on the kind of person we’re talking about.
This is really useful, because it enables us to be clear about the smallest viable audience. “Our typical customer” is a more accurate and useful way to start a sentence than, “the average person.” Because typical implies intent. “The person we are seeking to serve does this…”","June 5, 2020","average, typical, audience"
Maybe everyone else isn’t faking it,"Think about your most deeply-held beliefs. It’s entirely possible that someone who disagrees with you feels just as deeply.
Consider your chronic aches, your devastating pain, your persistent allergy–it’s possible someone else has their own version of this, but different.
And perhaps, your dreams and desires, the ones that keep you up at night, are similar (but different) from the person sitting right next to you.
They’re not making it up. It’s as real as you are.","June 4, 2020","Empathy, Beliefs, Pain"
Stuck on enormity,"When a problem appears too large, too intractable and too unspeakable to deal with, it’s easy to give up.
There never seems to be enough time, enough resources or enough money to make the big problems go away.
Perhaps we can start with a very small part of it. One person, one opportunity, one connection.
Drip by drip, with commitment.
Those are the two hard parts. The insight to do it drip by drip and the persistence to commit to it.","June 3, 2020","overcoming challenges, small steps, persistence"
I can’t imagine,"There’s just no way to be sure what it feels like. Other people, people in our lives or out of it, people who look like us or don’t. Your mileage will vary, your experience will be different. Some started with a huge head start, some with a disadvantage they couldn’t possibly deserve.
Of course, the “I” is really we. No matter who we are, we can’t truly know what it feels like for someone else.
It may be that we can’t imagine what it’s like to be the victim of systemic distrust and profiling. Or what it’s like to worry about putting food on this table for that family. Or what it’s like to be fighting a chronic illness or being unjustly accused of a crime.
We can try. We assume it’s just like what happened to us, but slightly different. We can realize that tragedy is unevenly distributed and in constant rotation, but it’s never going to be the same.
But just because we can’t imagine–it doesn’t mean we can’t care. We can refuse to magnify our differences and focus on maximizing possibility, justice and connection instead. To take action and to dig in.
The leverage we have to see, to speak up and to create long-term change is a difficult weight to carry. Because if we can do something to make things more just, that means that we must.

"Justice and dignity, too often in short supply","[From two years ago, even more relevant right now]
You will never regret offering dignity to others.
We rarely get into trouble because we overdo our sense of justice and fairness. Not just us, but where we work, the others we influence. Organizations and governments are nothing but people, and every day we get a chance to become better versions of ourselves.
And yet… in the moments when we think no one is looking, when the stakes are high, we often forget. It’s worth remembering that justice and dignity aren’t only offered on behalf of others.
Offering people the chance to be treated the way we’d like to be treated benefits us too. It goes around.
The false scarcity is this: we believe that shutting out others, keeping them out of our orbit, our country, our competitive space—that this somehow makes things more easier for us.
And this used to be true. When there are 10 jobs for dockworkers, having 30 dockworkers in the hall doesn’t make it better for anyone but the bosses.
But today, value isn’t created by filling a slot, it’s created by connection. By the combinations created by people. By the magic that comes from diversity of opinion, background and motivation. Connection leads to ideas, to solutions, to breakthroughs.
The false scarcity stated as, “I don’t have enough, you can’t have any,” is more truthfully, “together, we can create something better.”
We know it’s the right thing to do. It’s also the smart thing.","June 1, 2020","justice, dignity, connection"
Consider a gap year,"Millions of college-age students have to make a difficult decision soon. Spending all that money and time has always been a significant choice, but now it’s more fraught. The accredited institutions that are now suddenly offering students an online education simply haven’t committed the time or effort to actually be good at it. They’re offering something without effectiveness, polish or insight.
The alternative is agap year. Not just for college students, but for high school students and even adults.
The gap year has a terrible name. It implies that the year is somehow wasted, that it’s a gap snuck in between the stuff that you’re supposed to be doing.
But of course, it’s not that at all. Living is what we’re supposed to be doing. Contributing. Learning. Figuring out how to make things better. The stuff we’re not doing when we’re simply complying–that’sthe point. Our compliance years are the gap.
And we should commit our time with intention.
If you can afford it, this is a powerful moment to invest in the next chapter of who you are and what you will become.
For an adult, that’s an expensive commitment. To walk away from your freelance path or your job search to dig in to become the leader and connector and expert you’ve always hoped to become.
But for a student, it’s actually a bargain. It’s a chance to step off the carousel of conformity and lockstep obedience and actually commit to a path of your own choosing. Keep your tuition money and put it to work for you, not for some football team.
A month, a semester, or an entire year. A chance to create a change, to make an impact, to cause a shift in your posture that you’ll have forever.
We’ve become ever more suspicious of the bargain that the industrial world has been offering: compliance in exchange for stability. The alternative is to own your path and to do the incredibly difficult work of choosing with intent and then sticking with it.

And so, utility companies lobby to ease emission standards, when they would be just fine if the standards were tightened. And so tech companies fight against new formats and new forms of exchange instead of leading with them. And of course, powerful cultural forces fight to preserve their hierarchies instead of figuring out how to thrive with new ones.
What we want and how we believe we get it are often two different things.","July 25, 2020","status quo, innovation, business transformation"
Money costs money,"Because there’s a cost to using it on one thing instead of another.
And because the person who invests money has choices, and often chooses the choice that works best for them.
Most people would be happy with a hotel that generates a profit of a thousand dollars a day. But if the hotel cost $50,000,000 to build, you’re bust.
Time costs money too.
That’s not the same as saying “time is money,” which it isn’t. Time is magnificent, hard to stockpile and impossible to recover.
But it still costs. Which means that it’s worth considering whether something worthwhile comes back for your investment and your effort.","July 24, 2020","investment, cost, opportunity"
Keys on the ground,"If you find a key and you don’t know what lock it will fit, you haven’t found much.

Varieties of disbelief,"Everyone, without exception, has found some things to not believe in. Things that are demonstrably true that we just don’t want to accept.
A bit like a fingerprint, each person’s pattern of disbelief is probably unique. You might believe that water is made of atoms, but that the moon is made of cheese. It’s hard to predict.
But the interesting question is: What has to happen for you to change your mind? What standard of proof, from what source, is sufficient for us to accept that something we’re sure wasn’t true, is true?
That’s a great place to begin.","July 22, 2020","disbelief, belief change, perception"
Fake deadlines,"Slack enables systems to function with more efficiency. That’s because unavoidable delays and errors compound in a system that doesn’t have enough buffer space.
But fake deadlines don’t solve this problem. Fake deadlines exist when we can’t trust others (or ourselves) to be clear about our progress or prioritize honestly. So we invent a date before we actually need something to arrive.
The challenge is that fake deadlines compound. Once someone on another project realizes that they’ve been outfoxed by a fake deadline, they’ll simply escalate their urgency as well. Or perhaps the provider realizes that we’ve been faking the deadlines, and so now there’s a whole new level of guessing about what the real deadline is.
Professionals don’t need fake deadlines and don’t respect them. Instead, we have the chance to build in appropriate slack, get our priorities straight and keep our promises.","July 21, 2020","fake deadlines, efficiency, priorities"
Doom scrolling,"Being informed is a virtue. It helps us make better decisions and encourages us to take action.
Getting hooked on an endless scroll of media inputs is not the same as being informed. There’s long been a business model of urgent news (“man bites dog!”), but now it’s been leveraged, amplified and optimized to suck people in for hours at a time. And division is much easier to sell than progress.
If it’s not helping you take action to make things better, what’s it for?","July 20, 2020","Doom scrolling, Media consumption, Information overload"
Commercial vulnerability,"If you have a retail chain that offers:
A variety of products
at high margins
that are easy to ship
without being needed immediately
in expensive retail locations
where the in-person shopping experience isn’t particularly remarkable…
Then you’re in big trouble. Even before the pandemic. Because an online retailer is going to offer a better-priced, more convenient, higher-variety alternative and once your best customers try it, they won’t come back very often.
That seems pretty obvious, and we’re seeing the retail landscape littered with companies that should have seen this coming but didn’t do anything about it, because they were too busy protecting what they thought they were good at.
The question for most of us is: What if the work you do is:
compliance-based
standardized
repetitive
not based on innovative or flexible customer interaction…
If it is, it’s pretty likely that you’ll be replaced by a combination of robots, AI and outsourcing.
If they can find someone or something cheaper than you, they’re going to work overtime to do so.
The alternative is to be local, creative, energetic, optimistic, trusted, innovative and hard to replace.","July 19, 2020","Retail vulnerability, AI replacement, innovation"
Inventing narratives,"That story in your head? It’s invented.
It has to be.
It might be based on some things that actually happened. The story we tell ourselves might be a useful predictor now and then. The story might even have been put there against our wishes, over time.
But it can’t possibly be a complete and detailed understanding of everything. That’s why it’s a narrative. It’s a shorthand, a map–not the territory. It’s filled with shortcuts and mindreading, a personal myth about you and your role in the world.
If we find our story isn’t helping us, if it’s inaccurate or distracting or enervating, we can work to change it.","July 18, 2020","narratives, self-perception, personal myth"
The benefit of the doubt,"Sometimes we earn it.
Sometimes, it’s handed to us even when we don’t deserve it.
And sometimes, we’re deprived of it, through no fault of our own.
Everything works better when we have the benefit of the doubt, and offering it doesn’t cost very much at all.
And it’s rare enough that we should work overtime not to waste it.","July 17, 2020","benefit of the doubt, trust, understanding"
FOMO and KIMO,"FOMO, of course, is the avoidable malady often known as ‘fear of missing out.’ It can completely undermine a life well lived, because it drives people to follow a crowd out of fear.
KIMO is in the past tense. “Knowing I missed out.” This is also avoidable, but in a different way. (I pronounce it K-eye-moh.)
I recently joined a club that sends out a liter of olive oil every now and then. And it comes with a newsletter. The newsletter reported that so many people are now members that they couldn’t send everyone the same type of oil, so they split the shipment in half. They then reported, in detail, everything about each of the two oils.
I can’t help it. I liked the reporting on the other one better.
While I’m confident that the one I ended up with will be delicious, my knowledge of what I missed, so beautifully described, is unavoidable.
It didn’t have to be. They could have also divided the newsletter in half. And more helpful, I could simply choose to not feel KIMO if it isn’t helpful.
Giving those you serve the satisfaction of knowing that they made a great choice is a fine service to offer. And we can find it for ourselves if we try.","July 16, 2020","FOMO, KIMO, choice"
"Professionals, hacks and amateurs","The differences have little to do with skill, and a lot to do with resolve and intent.
The amateur contributes with unfiltered joy. There’s really no other upside–create your work because you can, because it helps someone else, because it makes you feel good.
The professional shows up even when she doesn’t feel like it. The professional understands the market, the customer and the price to be paid for work that’s worth paying for. But the professional isn’t a hack.
A hack is a professional who doesn’t care.
The hack has been beaten up enough times that he has emotionally disconnected. The hack has a short-term view, able to do what the client asks, without regard for how it will impact the culture or his long-term prospects.
Serviceable is for hacks. Memorable and remarkable belong to professionals and hard-working amateurs.","July 15, 2020","Professionals, Amateurs, Hacks"
What’s your story?,"If you care about it, it’s probably a story.
Whether you did well on the job interview. The results of your work to find resources to feed the hungry. Your efforts to engage with your teenagers…
We remember Bastille Day, not because we were there, but because the story resonates with us. We vote for candidates because of their stories, and shop at stores that have a story that resonates with us. And it’s a story that determines how people react to an emergency in their town.
The last time we took action on an idea, extended ourselves for a friend, and perhaps encouraged ourselves to launch a new project–these happened because the story worked.
And it’s possible to tell a better story.
It’s on us. We need to learn how to hear stories, figure out which ones are resonating, and do the difficult and urgent work to make our stories more effective.
Because if we care about it, it’s worth doing better.
There are techniques worth learning and doing the work with others on a similar journey is a powerful shortcut to doing it well. We’re relaunching theStory Skills Workshopwith bestselling author Bernadette Jiwa today. It’s not only a place to share your story but it’s a place to learn how to do it better.

Undoing the toxic myth of exclusion and scarcity,"It’s easy to believe that excluding a group increases the benefits for those that are doing the excluding. That division and barriers somehow benefit the people who divide and hoard.
That’s true when we’re talking about allocating a truly scarce resource. If you’re on a spaceship that’s headed for Mars, the oxygen you’ve got is all you’ve got. (Unless you have a population with the innovation needed to make more).
But in our modern world, a world built on community, connection and the magic that comes from combining ideas, the opposite is true. When people deprive others of education and opportunity, they’re not helping themselves, they’re depriving themselves of the benefits that would come from what others would end up contributing. We don’t benefit from treating others poorly, we pay for it.
More programmers, more healthy parents, more scientists, more leaders, more passionate artists, more breakthrough designers, more caring health care providers–it doesn’t crowd out anything. It creates more opportunity for everyone.
This is one reason that the faux scarcity of famous colleges is so toxic. Because we don’t have to exclude and sort to help people move forward, yet we do.
If you’ve ever heard a clarinet orchestra perform, you can instantly see how this works. Of course, there are no all-clarinet orchestras, because they don’t sound very good.

None of the above,"That’s a comfortable thing to say for some. It lets you off the hook.
There are definitely people in every group who prefer “none of the above,” regardless of what’s on offer. Because none of the above is also a choice, something that’s offered without being offered.
Being against might feel easier than being for.","July 12, 2020","none of the above, choice, ambivalence"
Systems design and the front line,"If you experience lousy service or poor quality, it’s probably not solely the fault of the person who talked to you on the phone, dealt with you at the counter or assembled your product.
It’s the boss.
The boss didn’t design the system properly, didn’t align incentives, didn’t invest in training. The boss isn’t thinking hard about hiring the right people. And the boss isn’t listening.
As a result, the frontline workers are often undertrained, underresourced and overscheduled.
But, and it’s a huge but, those very same frontline workers don’t have to suffer in silence. They can provide a useful conduit of information and feedback. They can model how it could work better and establish a model for those around them. Not because it’s easy, but because it’s important.
The top-down nature of the industrial entity is rapidly being replaced by the power of peer-to-peer learning and leadership. There’s no top and no bottom. Simply the ranks of people who care enough to make things better.","July 11, 2020","Systems design, frontline workers, peer-to-peer learning"
Sixty orbits,"Birthdays are contagious. No one actually remembers the day they were born, other people remember it for you. And the way we celebrate them is cultural, a shared process that keeps changing.
People keep track of birthdays, and today used to be mine.
Sixty of them.
It doesn’t feel like it’s been that many. Time flies when you’re busy.Lots and lots of projects. Countless friends made, lessons learned and ideas shared. Quite a journey, with lucky breaks and advantages again and again, beginning with my parents, the cultural identity, time and town where I was born… I wouldn’t have been able to go on this journey without you, thank you.
But today’s not my birthday (no need to send an email or a card). I’ve never really liked my birthday (it’s a long story involving a non-existent parrot), and the only reason for this post is to talk about who owns my birthday now.
What happens if we start celebrating our birthdays differently? Today belongs to the 20,000 + people who are on their way to a permanent supply of clean drinking water because readers like you brought their birthday (and mine) tocharity:water. Thank you. Now, particularly now, when the world is in pain and when so many people are wrestling with health, the economy and justice, it’s more urgent than ever to think of someone you’ve never met living a life that’s hard to imagine.
And today, because it celebrates a round number, I’m hoping you will join in and help us break charity:water’s birthday record. And maybe donate your birthday too. Better still, if you subscribe as a monthly donor, you become a core supporter of a movement that changes lives with persistence and care.
How it works:
If you have the ability, I’m hoping you’ll clickhereand donate to charity:water to celebrate what used to be my birthday.
And either way, I’m hoping you’ll also donateyourbirthdayto them. Because when it’s your turn to celebrate a missing parrot or a lost cake, you can ask your friends, and they can do what you just did.
It’s hard to visualize 21,000 people, mostly kids, fighting illness because the water in their village is undrinkable. That’s about three times the population of the town where I live. Thanks to all of you, my projects, including this blog, have already raised nearly a million dollars to build long-term solutions to this problem.
Will you help me double that?
Even one kid who lives the life he or she is capable of is worth this blog post and worth your support.

Take good notes,"Everyone is entitled to their own experience.
In fact, that’s all we ever get. Our own take on the world around us, informed by where we’ve been and where we seek to go.
Sometimes, we get the chance to hear about someone else’s experience. In those moments, it’s tempting to use the opportunity to explain a situation, to excuse or even to persuade.
Perhaps it pays to simply take good notes.
Acknowledge what you’re hearing. Encourage and amplify and find empathy.
There are plenty of opportunities to expound on our version of the world. Every once in a while we have the rare chance to explore someone else’s.","July 9, 2020","empathy, experiences, listening"
The magic of the countdown,"Thea von Harbouinvented the countdown. 10, 9, 8…
It works.
It focuses the attention of everyone involved and ensures that we’re truly alert for what’s going to happen next.
It helps that the numbers go down, not up (because up might never end). And it helps that as we get closer to lift-off, tension goes up, not down.
But what really matters is this: There’s a commitment.
When we get to zero, we’re actually going to do this.
The commitment has to happen before the countdown can.","July 8, 2020","countdown, commitment, focus"
The 100 hour asset,"We’re all so busy doing our work that sometimes we fail to build a skill worth owning.
If you invest 100 hours in a rare skill, you’re likely to acquire it. If you could learn to sharpen a tool better than your peers, organize a high-performance database, see the nuances in some sector of cryptography, know how to build a pretty-good WordPress site or really understand the arc of a particular writer’s career, you’d have something of value. Something that anyone who was focused enough to invest 100 hours could have, but few will choose to commit to.
String together a few of those, or dig deep and develop a 1,000 hour asset and now you truly have something.
There’s huge pressure to fit in, and plenty of benefits if you invest the time and stand out instead.
Twenty hours a week for a year and you can know something that puts you in a new category. Access to knowledge isn’t nearly as difficult as the desire to learn.","July 7, 2020","skill acquisition, investment, personal development"
The difference between patina and cruft,"Cruft is obsolete. Cruft is broken, discarded, non-functioning refuse that should be hauled away.
Patina is the wabi-sabi of positive use. A bookshelf of well-worn encyclopedias (now replaced by Wikipedia) has a patina to it. Simply seeing it reminds us of the possibility of discovery.

“It might not be for you”,"If you walk into a noisy bar and ask why they don’t have Chopin on the jukebox, they’re unlikely to accommodate you.
The same is true if you go to a BBQ joint and insist on sushi.
Most of the brands we truly care about stand for something. And the thing they stand for is unlikely to be, “whatever you want, we have it.” It’s also unlikely to be, “you can choose anyone and we’re anyone.”

Are we part of us?,"Liberty is a state of mind. It can be seen as a chance for freedom, or a promise made but not kept. We can choose to be part of something or choose to be apart.
Liberty is the offer and promise and requirement of responsibility. A willingness to connect and to offer dignity in response to those around us.
Independence is actually about cooperation and interconnectedness.
Yet we’ve set up systems that limit what we see, how we connect and insulate us from the hard work that’s right in front of us.
One of the most important words I know doesn’t have a simple English equivalent, which says a lot. Sawubona, a Zuluterm, means, “I see you.” Not just your face, of course, but your hopes, your dreams, where you came from and where you’re going. It’s not something we’re good at, and I need to do it better.

Wasting second place,"100 people apply for a job. 99 are sent home. What if the winner hadn’t applied? You might have been thrilled with the person who almost got the job.
17,000 people apply to a famous college. Only 10% get in. But at least a third were good enough to get in but didn’t get lucky. What happens to their narrative?
Selective organizations need to get better about communicating to the people who ‘almost’ make it. And it’s an incredible waste to discard all the knowledge that was gained in the sorting process… how to share it to help someone else?

Stolen ideas,"Is there a difference between someone stealing a potato from your farm and someone stealing your idea?
Well, if everyone in town comes and takes a potato, your farm is bust.
But if everyone in town comes and takes your idea, you’re more known, trusted and effective than you used to be.
During Google’s beginnings, their business and tech plan was available to anyone who stopped by Stanford and bothered to read it. Every popular podcast based on an original idea gave away that original idea the moment the first episode of the podcast was available–long before the podcast itself became popular.
When I was a book packager, we ended up publishing about 120 books and pitching another 1,000 that were never published. In all of that time, I can only remember one of our ideas (it was a big one) being stolen from us and published without our participation. That code of ethics created a feeling of intellectual safety. But, at the same time, it was our successful books that were copied the most–and that copying was not just a symptom but often a cause of their success.
The internet is a copying machine. Ideas morph and change and spin as they move from one end to the other. Ripping ideas off wholesale and violating intellectual property rights is nothing to be proud of–each of us can do better than that. But holding ideas too tightly in fear of the ripples and echoes they’re going to cause is the real problem.
Being original is an opportunity to advance the conversation. Building something of utility with persistence and grace is truly generous, though, and it’s not related to whether or not anyone has ever heard your idea before.","July 1, 2020","Intellectual property, idea sharing, originality"
Famous colleges,"Parents can do their children a favor if, from an early age, kids hear them say “famous college” instead of “good college.”
Because there’s very little data that shows that colleges with big football programs or lots of Nobel prize winners are actually good at doing what a college should do for an undergraduate.
If you want to spend the time and the money and the debt to go to a famous college, that’s your choice.
But don’t be confused into believing that a famous one is a good one.
And in this back-to-school moment, it’s smart to not only consider a gap year filled with intention as a way to engage with the world, but to think about what we’re actually buying when we buy a degree from a famous college.
Education and learning continue to diverge. In-person, real-time learning is too expensive, too scarce and rarely as effective as it could be, and we’re discovering that a commitment to life-long learning is more important than a four-year sabbatical that costs too much and delivers too little. And good colleges are in a position to do something about this, while the ones that are merely famous will fight hard to maintain their status quo.
Scarcity isn’t always needed to create value.
The pandemic has created a significant shift in perception, and the repercussions are going to be felt by colleges for years to come–many of them are going to be refactored, restructured or disappear.","August 31, 2020","famous colleges, education value, gap year"
Date certain,"One of the most expensive things a service business or freelancer can do is promise that work will be done by a certain day. Which is something we need to do, of course, but we should charge appropriately. “It’ll be done soon,” should be way cheaper than, “It’ll be done at exactly 11 am on Tuesday.”
And one of the most important things we can do to focus our energy and commitment is be prepared to promise a date certain. It sharpens everything.","August 30, 2020","date certain, service business, pricing strategy"
Systemic problems,"… demand systemic solutions.
First, we have to pay attention.
Then we need to acknowledge that a solution is possible.
And then we need to commit. To the long, persistent road to altering the status quo.
The world is forcing us to pay attention to lingering problems more urgently than ever before. Real change on issues of dignity, justice and health are long overdue
Urgent problems are too important to earn only a moment of our attention. Important projects demand that we keep showing up to make the change we seek. Showing up and showing up, at the root and at every turn, consistently working toward systemic solutions.
When we think about the problems we’ve solved as a community, this is the way it always happens. Making things better, over time, with focus. Persistent commitment doesn’t lower the urgency of the moment, it acknowledges it.","August 29, 2020","Systemic solutions, commitment, social change"
"Destinations, risks and journeys","Where are you headed? The choices you’re making, the effort, the sacrifices—where is the destination?
We make choices every day about our destination. And because of those choices, we go on a journey.
Along that journey, we take risks but we also experience an internal narrative about those risks.
And so, destinations, risks (perceived and actual) and journeys define our lives.
It’s possible you’ve come to the conclusion that the destination you’ve chosen isn’t for you. That being a pop star, a successful VP of accounting or a receptionist with a secure position isn’t a life you’d like to lead.
But don’t confuse that with the journey. Maybe you’d be happy with the pot of gold at the end of your rainbow, but it’s entirely possible you don’t want to suffer the discomfort and indignities and effort it will take to get to that destination, that you’d like an easier path. You’ll happily take the destination but the truth is, the journey is too arduous.
And don’t confusethatwith your imagining of the risks along the way. It might be that you want the destination, that you are willing to put up with (or even delight in) the journey but your narrative of the risks and dangers are just too much to handle.
When we conflate the destination with the journey and with our narrative of the risks, we have no hope of improving any of the three. Instead, we often pushed to throw out all three at once or embrace them all. But it’s possible, with effort and planning, to make the journey more palatable or the risks feel more tolerable.
The destination isn’t the journey. And our narrative of the actual risks is up to us.","August 28, 2020","Destinations, Risks, Journeys"
Small adjustments,"Even better than buying a new bicycle is adjusting the seat on your existing bike properly.
That’s because the height of the seat changes your power. It’s the point of maximum leverage, responsible for aligning all of the forces you bring to bear on the process.
When we begin to think about our work, we tend to focus on the largest structures–what it looks like from the outside. But as we engage with the problem at hand, it turns out that our impact changes based on how we stand, what we believe and the ways we interact with the systems right in front of us.
Get the strategy right, then implement small changes, repeated with persistence and generosity.","August 27, 2020","Adjustments, Strategy, Impact"
Far away is difficult,"Humans are bad at understanding things that are very far away in scale or time.
Atoms aren’t actually made up of tiny particles that are like rocks, but smaller. And planets aren’t simply very large billiard balls. We can only understand the behavior of things big and small by realizing that they’re not actually different versions of something of the size that we can easily see.
Things that happened a million years ago are hard to visualize, and we can’t reliably make many guesses about how the world is going to be a thousand years from now (and even fifty is difficult–lately, four weeks is a stretch).
Physics is straightforward–except when it comes to things that are very small and those that are very large, when it all gets weird. Different rules apply.
Extrapolation is far easier to claim than it is to do. That person across the counter or the web from you probably has very different experiences, beliefs and expectations than you do. Starting with your experience and assuming it matches their own is a trap.

From education to learning,"Education is the hustle for a credential. It exchanges compliance for certification. An institution can educate you.
Learning can’t be done to you. It is a choice and it requires active participation, not simple adherence to metrics.
Learning is the only place to find resilience, possibility and contribution, because learning is a lifelong skill that isn’t domain dependent.
Most of the learning moments in our lives are accidental or random. A situation presents itself and if we’re lucky, we learn something from it.
We built thealtMBAto make learning intentional.

Profit taking is lazy,"Once an organization reaches scale, particularly if it feels like a monopoly, it’s tempting to “take profits.”
This means less investment, fewer staff and a lot less care. Those things are expensive. Easier to simply keep the money.
And those things involve emotional effort. Easier to simply point to the bottom line, as if that’s the point.
Lazy managers dump the emotional labor on overworked frontline staff instead of creating systems that create value for everyone.
And lazy shareholders reward quarterly earnings instead of understanding the long-term ramifications of failing to serve customers.

Situational gravity,"All of us are good at rationalizing. It helps us process the world, navigate our choices and live with ourselves.
But gravity doesn’t care if you got a lot of sleep last night or not. It’s still the same amount of force.
The pavement doesn’t care if you always wear a helmet on your bike, except just this one time when you didn’t, because you were having a video taken.
Melanoma doesn’t care that you always wear sun screen, except that one day when you were really busy and couldn’t go back to the house for it.
Outside forces don’t care about the situation, because they have no awareness or memory. They simply are.
Newton’s law doesn’t care that you were really distracted and that’s why you weren’t wearing a seatbelt, and the virus that infected your friend doesn’t care about why that person in the office decided not to wear a mask, either.

And it’s not panic.

Toward a Zoom agreement,"If you promise not to check your email while we’re talking, we promise to not waste your time.
If you agree to look me in the eye and try to absorb the gist of what I’m saying, I agree to be crisp, cogent and on point.
If you are clear about which meetings are a waste of time for you to attend, we can be sure to have them without you.
If you can egg me on and bring enthusiasm to the interaction, I can lean into the work and reflect back even more energy than you’re contributing.
The purpose of a meeting is not to fill the allocated slot on the Google calendar invite. The purpose is to communicate an idea and the emotions that go with it, and to find out what’s missing via engaged conversation.

Like a surgeon,"Some jobs need you to show up in person (and for the time being, surgeons are in that category, but with robotically controlled waldo arms, who knows…).
But many jobs can be done more effectively with a combination of asynchronous work, video calls and emotional effort.
Don’t confuse a long or risky commute and co-work with showing up with your full self.
If they don’t need you in person, perhaps it’s better to show up with a great attitude instead of paying the high price it takes to be there on time, in real time.
And if they do need you in person, then be there. Truly there. 100% present.
It’s the slots in between, where attendance is taken, power is on display and the work is mediocre that cause us a lot of stress.","August 19, 2020","remote work, presence, emotional effort"
Cheating,"There are really only two ways to approach this:
“We don’t cheat.”
“We cheat when we can get away with it.”
The posture of, “our side doesn’t cheat,” is the belief in the validity of the game itself. It’s a statement of moral authority, a promise of consistency and valor. It respects the process.
The posture of, “cheat if you can,” is the belief in the ends at any cost. It degrades the system, because if everyone cheats, then there is no system left.
Cheaters often brag about their exploits, because they want to normalize them.
Sophisticated competitors, the ones who really want to win, understand that cheating destroys the very thing they set out to do. Because once cheating is normalized, the winner is the person who had the guts to cheat the most and destroy the system, not the one who deserved to win. Being against cheating doesn’t mean you don’t want to compete, it means that you do.
In every community, on every team, there are people who believe that the only chance they’ve got is to cheat. Our systems persist only when peers in the community step up and insist that the cheater stop. Because being on a team that wins by cheating is ultimately self-defeating.","August 18, 2020","cheating, integrity, competition"
Spreading like wildflowers,"Often, people encounter ideas that are spreading like wildfire.
The problem with a wildfire is that not only is it out of control, but it leaves nothing but destruction in its wake.
Build an idea that spreads like wildflowers instead.","August 17, 2020","wildflowers, ideas, destruction"
Wants and needs,"You’re unlikely to get everything you want. That’s a good thing, because wants are part of what define us.

Noodling,"If someone offers you “feedback,” your Spidey sense might start to tingle. Feedback isn’t often part of a warm and fuzzy feeling.
“Advice” is better. If you ask someone else for advice, you’re engaging them in your journey.
But, as Peter Shepherd points out, “noodling” is the best of all. When we start noodling over an idea, we can be sure that no one is going to get injured.","August 14, 2020","Feedback, Advice, Noodling"

The Sunday circular,"The “freestanding insert” was a multi-billion dollar business. Printed in bulk, then handed over to newspapers that would insert it into their Sunday paper, it was filled with coupons. In fact, the coupons were the entire point.
And the coupons worked.
They worked for two reasons:
As commerce moves online. the activities are changing, the middlemen are as well, but the two pillars remain. Priceline was a pioneer in this, giving travel shoppers a way to sign up for hassle, inconvenience and insecurity (you didn’t know which airline until after you bought your ticket) as a way to signal to airlines that they cared a great deal about price.

Selling your time,"We don’t pay surgeons by the hour.
And if the person who cuts the lawn shows up with a very fast riding mower, we don’t insist on paying less because they didn’t have to work as hard.
Often, what we care about is the work done, not how long it took to do it.
And yet, some jobs, from law to programming, charge by the hour.
When you sell your time, you’re giving away your ability to be a thoughtful, productivity-improving professional.

Simple tips for security and serial numbers,"[This probably impacts every person reading this, but few of us get to decide to fix it. I figured it was worth sharing so you can share it…]
Don’t require special characters (like ! or worse, ‘) in the passwords created in your app or on your site. You’re simply training people to either forget them or to write them down in an unsafe location. Instead, require long passwords.
When you set up a wifi password that others have to use, there’s really no reason to use capital letters, special characters or anything that’s a hassle to type on a phone. Try a phone number instead.
Don’t use ‘0’, ‘O’, ‘o’, ‘l’ or ‘1’ in any context where they have to be distinguished–like room numbers, serial numbers or the names of children. This is why zip codes are easier to use than postal codes, and why mixed letters and numbers are worth avoiding.
If you’re requiring 2FA (a good thing), don’t rely on email or texts, use an app instead. And don’t make the text code 7 digits (as my former bank did in an effort to pretend that they cared). 6 is more than enough.
Instead of serial numbers, companies should consider using three words mushed together, like hey-zebra-fun. This is way easier to read and communicate to others. Imagine how easy it would be to deal with your VIN or computer serial number if you could simply say three words. All the company will need is three lists of 300 common words, which, when juxtaposed, give us plenty of combinations.
And a password manager is a worthwhile program to install. If you haven’t, today’s a great day to start.
BONUS: It never hurts to say ‘please’ in your forms and other online communications. It’s free.
Thanks.

Don’t waste the lesson,"Things rarely turn out precisely the way we hoped.

Drop in,"One of the most difficult things to do in skateboarding is to learn to ‘drop in’. This is the commitment at the top of the ramp. One moment, you’re standing still, at the abyss, and the next you’re committed, fully engaged with gravity.
The worse thing you can do is half.
When yousortof commit, you’re likely to fall.
The rule is pretty simple: If you’re going to bother going skateboarding, then you’ve already decided. In this moment, you’re not making a new decision. You’re simply acting on what you said you wanted to do in the first place.
Decide once. It’s fine to opt-out. But once you decide, there’s no upside in re-litigating your decision, particularly when it leads to needless risk and wasted effort.
And of course, you may have realized all the moments in our lives where our hesitation to drop in is precisely at the heart of the challenge.

What do you own?,"Your skills.
Your reputation.
The noise in your head, your attitude, your personal passions…
But after that, it starts to diverge.
Some own real estate. Some own machines. Some own trademarks, or the permission asset of being able to interact with people who want to be interacted with.
If you want to build a career as a freelancer, or a business as an entrepreneur, it helps to own something. Really valuable public companies are worth so much because of the assets they own and the market position they can defend as they grow. A hard-working but disrespected worker (whether an online freelancer or an actual factory worker) struggles because they’re not seen as owning enough. People have choices, and they often choose to hire and do business with entities that own something that they want to use or leverage.
As you seek to make a difference and to level up, it helps to come back to that key question: what do you own?","August 6, 2020","ownership, assets, career development"
Posing for selfies,"We act differently when we know we’re about to be on display.
Aim a camera at someone and they tense up. I guess we call it “taking” a picture for a reason. We feel defensive.
Social media multiplies this by counting “likes” (which doesn’t mean someone actually likes us) or “friends” (which doesn’t mean that someone is actually our friend.)
The irony is that the people we’re most likely to want to trust and engage with are the ones who don’t pose. They’re consistent, committed and clear, but they’re not faking it.
Figure out what you want to say, the change you seek to make, the story you want to tell–and then tell it. Wholeheartedly and with intent.

Shipping creative work,"If it doesn’t ship, it doesn’t count. If it’s not creatively productive, it’s not helpful. And if we’re lucky, this is the heart of our work. The work of creation in our chosen medium, putting ourselves on the hook, being asked to do something that’s never been done quite this way before.
Call this the work of a Creative, with a capital C. Someone who commits to making things better by leading through their work, and bringing insight and magic and utility to interesting problems.
It requires us to trust ourselves. To find a voice. To understand systems and genre and craft.
After a year of work, we launched theCreative’s Workshoplast year. It quickly became the most engaging at-your-own-pace workshop at Akimbo. The people in the workshop gave and received more feedback each day than most people get in six months. And streaks of a hundred days of productive work in a row were the norm.
We only do this twice a year, and the new session is open for registration today. I hope you’ll take a few minutes to read the details and check out what previous participants have said about it. The last session was powerful enough that it became the basis for my newbook, which comes out in November.
If you look for the purple circle on thispage, you’ll find our secret discount, which is at maximum value today, but it eventually disappears.

Two kinds of decisions worth focusing on,"HARD ONES because you know that whatever you choose is possibly the wrong path. Hard decisions are hard because you have competing priorities. Hard decisions that happen often are probably a sign that the system you’re relying on isn’t stable, which means that the thing you did last time might not be the thing you want to do this time.
EASY ONES because it probably means that you’ve got a habit going. And an unexamined habit can easily become a rut, a trap that leads to digging yourself deeper over time.

Steal the time from comfort,"Everyone gets the same 24 hours. Reset every day, a fresh start.
Some of us are privileged enough to have the choice on how to spend some of that time. We can feel busy, but the busy-ness is largely a choice, a series of decisions we’ve made over the years about the things we choose to do, but have come to believe wehaveto do.
These habits are now comfortable. Walking away from spending that time will cost us comfort. In the short run. But if we don’t walk away from how we spent time yesterday, it’s hard to imagine that tomorrow will be much better than today.

A too-simple answer to a complicated problem,"The problem: how can we get people what they want and need?
It turns out that the simple short-term answer is the market.
The marketplace makes it possible to buy a nail clipper made of hardened steel for just four dollars, but only when you’re ready. The marketplace offers some people a solid brass set of the cups and balls magic trick and other people a hand-blown glass vase.
The marketplace is hyper-alert and never tires of finding overlooked corners of desire.
But the marketplace is not wise.
It’s blind, short-term and fairly stupid. Because it has no overarching goal. The market is nothing but billions of selfish people, trading this for that, without regard for what’s next.
Left alone, capitalism will devolve into corruption, bribery and predatory pricing leading to monopoly. Left alone, capitalism will pollute rivers, damage our health and create ever greater divides.
Capitalism gets us an opioid epidemic, the dark patterns of social media and doom scrolling.
Because the market isn’t wise. It has no sense of time or proportion.
The only way for the simple answer to solve our complicated problems is for it to have guardrails, boundaries that enable it to function for the long haul.
That’s something we need leadership to get done. And it’s more likely to get done if we acknowledge that we need to do it.","August 1, 2020","marketplace, capitalism, leadership"
Lottery thinking,"Ironically enough, lottery thinking is a chronic problem.
Lotteries of all sorts grab our attention and change our agenda.
A lottery is an almost random event, a longshot, one that promises to change your life (for the better if it’s a money thing, for the worse if it’s medical, etc.).
The simple and immediate nature of the outcome is an essential part of the lottery’s power.
Getting hit by lightning, finding the perfect job, having a djinni grant three wishes–these are all lotteries.
We spent billions of dollars keeping liquids out of carry-on luggage for no rational reason. It was simply a negative lottery, one that momentarily got the public’s attention and then became part of a narrative about control.
There’s a mismatch between how vivid an outcome is and the odds that make that outcome likely or important to our daily plans. High media attention plus sudden change plus low odds tend to focus our minds more than the opposite.
The problem with lottery thinking is that it takes us away from thinking about the chronic stuff instead. The pervasive, consistent challenge that will respond to committed effort.

PS relevant aside: The other day I was passed by someone who was headed toward me, at high speed, in the middle of the street. He was on an electric skateboard. He had on a face mask, of course, but it was askew. He wasn’t wearing a helmet and he was vaping, all at the same time. Go figure.","September 30, 2020","Lottery thinking, chronic problem, decision-making"
Professional wrestling,"It’s a theater of status.
Professional wrestling isn’t about wrestling, of course. It’s about who’s up and who’s down. The stated rules are there to be broken by some of the participants, and it’s not professional in any useful sense related to the sport of wrestling.
And the metaphor is powerful in many areas of life.
But we can’t understand the metaphor without understanding the forms of status that are on offer.
There is the status of affiliation. This is about belonging, about knowing and living with the rules. It’s about weaving together the culture and this affiliation leads to a form of popularity.
And then there is the status of dominance. This is about winning at any cost, cheating and subjugating. It’s about unraveling the culture in service of just one aim–victory over the others.
Professional wrestling creates tension between the two forms of status. We know that we all benefit from affiliation, but often are swayed by the avenging dominator if we see ourselves in them.
The theater of status happens in our daily lives. It’s who sits where at the meeting, or who gets to announce that the Zoom session is over. It’s the insurgent and the status quo. It’s the dramatic back and forth between someone who seeks power and someone who is tired of being told what to do.
The successful affiliator doesn’t seek to out-dominate the dominator. Instead, affiliators weave together enough persistent community pressure to get things back on track. And sooner or later, people realize that the triumph of the dominator, while it can be painful, is short-lived.","September 29, 2020","Professional wrestling, status, affiliation"

“What time is your flight?”,"Why do cab drivers ask this question?
It’s not like they can get to the airport any faster.

If you make a plane bigger, it won’t land at every airport, and it will cost more to fly, even if you don’t sell all the seats.
Another set of trade-offs.
Good engineers don’t whine about trade-offs, because they realize that they’re the entire point.
If there were no trade-offs, we wouldn’t need their help, there would be no interesting problems worth solving.

"One at a time, over and over","It’s 2018, a special night out. The restaurant shouldn’t have been as disappointing as it was. The room was beautiful, the staff was trying hard, the menu was ambitious–and yet it fell flat.
I realized that the problem is one that many of us face:
All shift long, there’s a lot to do. Another plate to fire, another customer to serve, another plate to clean. And yetthiscustomer doesn’t care about all of that. For any given diner, this may very well be the only time he or she will ever eat here. For any given diner, this dish, this interaction–that’s the only chance you’re going to get.

When can we talk about our systems?,"Your team is down by a few points and the game is almost over. What play should you call?
[When can we talk about the system of drafting and training that got your team to this situation in the first place?]
Your back hurts and you think you need surgery to help with the pain.
[When can we talk about the technique you use when you go running every day?]
Your employee shows up late regularly. How can you get them to care more?
[When can we talk about your hiring and leadership approaches?]
There’s racial injustice and unfairness all around us.
[Can we talk about persistent indoctrination around caste?]
You just had an argument with your brother. What’s the best way for him to see that you’re right?
[When can we talk about the narratives your family has developed for generations?]
Universities and local schools are in crisis with testing in disarray and distant learning ineffective…
[When can we talk about what school is for?]
It’s comfortable to ignore the system, to assume it is as permanent as the water surrounding your goldfish. But the fact that we have these tactical problems is all the evidence we need to see that something is causing them, and that spending time on the underlying structure could make a difference.
In a crisis, there’s maximum attention. And in a crisis, we often discard any pretense of caring about systems and resilience and focus only on how to get back to normal. This is precisely why normal is what normal is, because we fight to get back to it.
Changing the system changes everything. And it might be even less work than pouring water on today’s tactical emergency.","September 24, 2020","systems, underlying structure, crisis management"
What does “shortly” mean?,"When a client or customer asks when a project is going to be done, an answer offered might be, “soon” or “shortly.”
Frustration ensues.
It ensues because “shortly,” means: “I’m not sure” and “I don’t want to be responsible” and “you shouldn’t ask.” It creates little in the way of connection, and doesn’t project confidence, authority or even care.
“Shortly” is a one-word way to say, “go away.”
The alternative is to seek to understand and to work to be understood.
If the customer is double-parked, a better answer might be, “it will definitely be less than ten minutes, give me your phone number and I’ll call you the moment it’s done.”
If the engagement manager is trying to juggle priorities and dependencies, a better response might be, “would it make things easier if we could narrow down the delivery date to a two-or-three day span?”
And if the client is simply curious to understand why she hasn’t heard from you and whether you’ve got this under control, perhaps the answer is, “the dilithium crystals shorted out, the new shipment is promised for Monday and in the past, it has taken two weeks after arrival for us to complete the testing.”
It might not be done, but confidence is restored.

Dancing with belief,"All of us believe things that might be inconsistent, not based on how the real world actually works or not shared by others. That’s what makes us human.
There are some questions we can ask ourselves about our beliefs that might help us create the change we seek:
Is it working?
If your belief is working for you, if it’s helping you navigate a crazy world and find solace, and if it’s not hurting anyone else, it’s doing what it’s supposed to do. Often, beliefs are about finding human connection and a way to tell ourselves about our place in the world, not as an accurate predictive insight as to what’s actually happening. And beliefs are almost always about community, about being part of something.
Is it helpful?
Air traffic controllers and meteorologists rarely believe that the earth is flat. It’s a belief that would get in the way of being competent at their work. If your beliefs are getting in the way of your work, of your health or the health of those around you, or of your ability to be a contributing citizen, it might be worth examining why you have them and how they got there. Did you decide to have these beliefs or did someone with an agenda that doesn’t match yours promote them?
Is it true?
True in the sense that it’s falsifiable, verifiable, testable and predictive. Falsifiable means that the belief is specific enough that something contrary to the belief could be discovered (“there are no orange swans” is a falsifiable belief, because all we need to do is find one orange swan). It’s not necessary for a belief to be scientifically true, in fact, it undermines the very nature of belief to require evidence. Once there’s evidence, then whatever is true is true, whether or not you believe it.
Do you need it to be true?
Which means that much of what we do to somehow prove our beliefs are true is wasted time and effort. If a belief is helping you make your way through the world, if it acts as a placebo and a balm and a rubric, then that’s sufficient. The problems occur when some people use our beliefs to manipulate us, when they prevent us from accomplishing our goals or contributing to the well being of those around us.
What would change your mind?
If we decide that our belief is actually true, we owe it to ourselves to be clear about what would have to happen for us to realize that it’s not. One of the frustrating things about conspiracies and modern memes is that as soon as they’re examined or contradicted, they’re simply replaced with a new variation. It’s one thing to change beliefs because the scientific method shows us a more clear view of what’s happening, it’s totally different to retreat to ever more unrelated stories in the face of reality. Sometimes, it’s easier for people to amend their belief with one more layer of insulation than it is to acknowledge how the world is likely to work.","September 22, 2020","beliefs, change, truth"
Crossing from the early adopters to a larger group,"I’ve blogged many times about thechasm.
That’s Geoffrey Moore’s term for the gap between the small part of the market populated with people who like to go first, and the larger group of people who want to get involved with something that’s proven, popular and effective.
The early adopters ask, “is it new?”
The early majority ask, “did it work?” and perhaps, “what’s everyone else doing?”
Longtime readers of this blog know that I do my work for early adopters. The smallest viable audience is sufficient to make an impact, and it allows me to focus on the people who are enrolled in the journey forward.
But if you delight the early adopters, they spread the word. That is how the chasm is crossed–not with fancy ads or clever hype, but because the people who are engaged do the generous work of telling the others.
We’re launching the first lessons of the tenth edition ofThe Marketing Seminarthis week. With more than 10,000 alumni, it’s the most popular workshop on the Akimbo platform. And it works. That’s why the 8,000 people who took it after the initial launch decided to join in. Not everyone goes first. Almost no one does. That’s how our culture changes–when the few early adopters tell the others. And so each of us has to persist and continue to show up in the marketplace, doing the work and earning the trust of people who don’t get a thrill out of going first.

Time to get back to magic,"Most of the time, the phrase is, “it’s time to get back to work.”
This means it’s time to stop being creative, stop dancing with possibility, stop acquiring new insights and inspiration–and go back to the measurable grind instead.

“Is that the most important thing?”,"If you want to have an argument, to raise tempers or to distract, the easiest thing to do is start bringing up things that are easy to argue about.
Not the things that are important.
Because the important things require nuance, patience and understanding. They require an understanding of goals, of the way the world works and our mutual respect.

Getting the joke,"“But why is this important?”
When we encounter a fashion, a film or some other cultural artifact that the critical establishment has celebrated, it’s easy to not understand it.
Taste, after all, is unevenly distributed.
But you don’t have to like something to understand why someone else thought it was important.
To move the culture forward, we need to have the empathy to imagine what others are seeing, liking and talking about.

Questions for the founder,"A friend shared a new business idea with me yesterday. Some business model questions came to mind, asked here rhetorically. If you get them right, everything else is easier:
How will you get new paying customers?
Why will your paying customers tell their friends and colleagues?
Will this business work at a scale that you can both achieve and are happy living with?
Is it easy to start?
If it is, what will keep others from starting it?
How do you avoid a race to the bottom where you’re trapped making a cheap commodity as a middleperson?
Will it get easier as you go? Why?
What incentive do customers have to stick with you instead of switching to a cheaper or more convenient choice?
Businesses that are cheap to start, depend on providing a useful service at a cheap margin and are largely fungible or invisible are often difficult to turn into thriving enterprises. Customer traction, the network effect and emotional connection can change this, particularly if you build them in from the start.

(Today’s the best day to look for the purple circle). It’s our last session of the year, and this is a great time to join in. That link gets you a significant time-sensitive discount at checkout.
So far more than 10,000 people in nearly a hundred countries have shown up and connected, contributed and learned to improve their craft.
We’d love to have you join us. (Check out what nearly 100 alumni had to say).","September 15, 2020","Marketing, Workshop, Seminar"
Bad choices,"If made freely, a choice feels like the right thing at the time.
But we realize it was a mistake later, once the moment passes. We don’t know now what we learned in the future.
Bad choices can be caused by:
Take a look: each of these is the product of outside forces and can be unlearned and insulated against. The good news is that we can get better at our choices.","September 14, 2020","bad choices, learning, decision-making"
“Taking” lessons,"What an accurate and horrible term.
It’s hard to imagine that most people would look forward to taking lessons. In the piano or arithmetic or anything else.
You take medicine. You take your punishment. It’s unwanted but grudgingly accepted.
The term gives away the intent behind it.
Learning is different. Learning is something we get to do, it’s a dance, an embrace, a chance to turn on some lights.
You don’t take a workshop. You are part of one.","September 13, 2020","Lessons, Learning, Mindset"
In support of the hard-working teacher,"Sometimes I talk about the education-industrial complex on this blog, rarely with kindness. I captured much of that inStop Stealing Dreams.
Readers will see that not once have I criticized a hard-working teacher who meant well. That’s because it’s the bureaucratic industrial system that’s at fault here, not the teachers.
Now more than ever, with teachers scrambling with remote learning, personal health and the shifts in our culture, they matter.
Teachers matter because they have the guts to buck the dominant test and measure system. Because they show up with care and energy, and because they lead.
By time spent, what percentage of the typical school experience is spent on: tests, test prep, comportment, homework, memorization, the curriculum and the social pressure of fitting in?
And what percentage is spent on daydreaming, inventing, creating from scratch, doing it without a manual and finding new solutions to difficult problems?
I don’t think it’s an accident that we spend a fortune on high school football and almost nothing on creative writing hackathons.
Change is going to come from parents and from teachers who care. The system defends the system, and the system requires adherence and stability.
The massive shift to remote learning opens the door to slip in the kind of challenging problem solving and connection that we need right now. We have to hurry, though, because surveillance and more testing is probably right around the corner.","September 12, 2020","Teachers, Education, Remote Learning"
The honest mistake vs. the intentional act,"Even though the harm may be the same, we’re much more likely to move on from an acknowledged accidental mistake.
Is it because we know that we’ve made honest mistakes ourselves, and the act of forgiving the other person is a way of forgiving ourselves? Or is it because it feels more random and less personal to be impacted by something that was a mistake?
Or perhaps, there’s some sort of reparation when the other person apologizes and works to improve… as if our suffering made a contribution for others who will follow.
In a third situation, a random accident, where there isn’t a perpetrator, it seems as though we’re the most likely to move on. If the cause is a fellow human, somehow we process misfortune differently. The intention is a double injury.
And yet, after the incident, when each of us is faced with the chance to acknowledge that we made an honest mistake, we often compound the problem and turn it into something more like an intentional act, simply because we’ve been taught to avoid taking personal responsibility.","September 11, 2020","Honest mistake, Intentional act, Personal responsibility"
“Because” vs. “and”,"The way you’re feeling… is itbecauseof something that’s going on around you? Or are you simply feeling somethingandthere’s a situation?
One way to determine the difference:
Has this situation ever happened without you (or anyone, for that matter) feeling the way you’re feeling?
[to pick an outdated example, one that someday we might experience again]:
“I’m feeling stressed and overwhelmed because there are ten people waiting for a table at the restaurant and we’re falling behind.”
Except: plenty of people who run restaurants have experienced ten people waiting for a table without feeling stressed and overwhelmed.
It’s not the line that’s causing the stress. It’s your interpretation of the line.
You’re overwhelmedandthere’s a line.","September 10, 2020","emotions, interpretation, stress"
Who is good at discovery?,"Apple has carefully guarded the podcast directory, persuading podcasters that ‘winning’ here is the shortcut to building a popular podcast. But they’re terrible at introducing podcasts to new listeners, terrible at developing a point of view that enables the industry to thrive or even grow.
Compare this to Netflix. They’re terrific at surfacing content and helping people find things that they end up liking. Netflix, for economic and marketing reasons, has limited the number of ‘shows’ they have to promote, but within their set, they continue to delight. Compare this to YouTube–if you follow the ‘recommended’ path for just a handful or two of clicks, you’ll end up with something banal or violent.
Google built its entire business on the mythology of discovery, persuading millions of entrepreneurs and creators that somehow, SEO would help them get found, at the very same time they’ve dramatically decreased organic search results to maximize revenue.
Bookstores were pretty good at helping people discover new books, and in some situations, Amazon’s even better. Often, though, particularly on the Kindle and with Audible, Amazon does little indeed to help people find serendipity as they think about what to engage with next. (And putting recommendations up for sale to the publishers is shortsighted and greedy, imho).
In music, Roon’s ‘radio’ feature does a startlingly good job of introducing me to songs I thought I already loved, even though I’m hearing them for the first time.
Given how much our culture depends on finding out what’s new, it’s surprising that few have figured out how to be smart about it. If you’re a creator, the truth remains what the truth has been ever since Yahoo tried to sort the web by hand: the best way to make a hit is to build something for the smallest viable audience and make it so good that people tell their peers.","September 9, 2020","Discovery, Content, Recommendation"
"Self-directed, project-based learning","Why do educated people too often fall for foolish scams and conspiracy theories?
The problem is that no one taught us tounderstand. Instead, we are pushed to simply to memorize. To be educated enough to do well on the test, and then to forget what we were taught, because we never actually learned it.
Understanding opens the door to insight and to comfort with the data. Understanding is the platform we need to go to the next level… memorizing is a fragile house of cards, with no foundation. And the compliance mindset of “will this be on the test?” simply sets us up to believe the next thing that we’re supposed to learn.
We now have a chance to turn this fall’s back-to-school (in the Northern Hemisphere) into self-directed, project-based learning instead of a rush toward compliance and butts in chairs and pencils on tests. Shipping the project, proving it works and then doing it again. Learning by doing. Self-direction unlocks our ability to contribute for a lifetime, whereas preparing for the test ensures that we will always be at the mercy of the person who is giving the test. People are not entitled to their own facts–and understanding helps us discover the ones that matter.
From the age of five, many kids are capable of self-directed, project-based learning if we’re willing to turn off the TV and accept that the process won’t immediately lead to sought-after standardized test results. We can create a pattern of teaching people to be curious because curiosity is an engine for learning… it is less predictable but far more powerful than the current alternative: Creating a desire to get it over with combined with the ability to believe whatever the person in power tells us to believe.
Learning opens the door to the future we’d like to live in.","September 8, 2020","Self-directed learning, project-based learning, understanding"
Toward tired,"If this was a blog post about running, I’d definitely be teaching things that would make you tired.
And if you want to learn anything about making a difference, being creative or leading, you should ask the person teaching to cover things that will make you afraid.
Because just as you have to figure out where to put the tired when you run a marathon, you’ll need to figure out where to put the fear when you do work that matters.","September 7, 2020","running, fear, creativity"
Optimism as a choice,"If your team is up by thirty points at halftime, it’s not optimistic to expect that you’re going to win–it’s a realistic assessment.
Optimism is an attitude and a choice. It involves context and focus. We’re not deluding ourselves with the reassurance that everything is going to be okay (because that’s not productive). Instead, we’re committed to finding things we can contribute to, work on and improve. We’re devoted to seeking out useful lessons and to discovering where the benefit of the doubt might be helpful.
Positive thinking doesn’t solve every problem. But it’s a much better tool than negative thinking.","September 6, 2020","Optimism, Positive Thinking, Attitude"
Earned crankiness,"When an adult chooses to be cranky, it’s much juicier when it’s accompanied by a feeling of entitlement.
If we know that we deserve the chance to be angry and disappointed, that we’ve earned it, then we can explore the feeling with vigor. No need to worry about whether we’re being self-indulgent, we can go full throttle because it’s our due.
Not only is this an effective way to alienate those around us, but it’s also based on the false assumption that it’s possible to have earned the right to be cranky.
Crankiness isn’t a feature. It’s a bug.","September 5, 2020","crankiness, entitlement, emotion"
Filling a bottomless hole,"For every journey, there are steps along the way.
Tasks that need to be done before you can successfully go on to the next one.
But if one of those tasks is one you can never finish, you’re stuck.
You can never read all the stuff on Twitter or catch up completely on the news or be sure that everything is alright.
Don’t make bottomless holes a checklist task. They’re a sideline, something to work on once you’ve actually done your work. Whatever work that you’ve chosen to do.","September 4, 2020","bottomless holes, tasks, productivity"
What’s your agenda?,"If you write something, speak up or otherwise interact with someone, you probably have a reason. There’s a point to your statement, a goal to your instruction.
The change you seek to make.
What actions are you hoping to cause?
If you don’t have an agenda, you’re probably sitting by quietly, or you’re frustrated at your lack of progress toward an unstated goal.
An agenda helps build resilience, because it’s a compass, a chance to reset when we’re thrown for a loop.
Being clear to ourselves about the change we seek to make makes it more likely we’ll make it.

Head’s up: We’re less than two weeks away from the launch ofThe Marketing Seminar. This is our tenth session.

Efficient or productive?,"When time gets short (for new parents or startup founders, for example) we naturally focus on getting efficient. We can remove extraneous details and distractions and magically get much faster at getting tasks done.
But being efficient is not the same as being productive.
Productive is the skill of getting therightthings done, so that we accomplish what we set out to do in the first place. The work that matters.","September 2, 2020","efficiency, productivity, time management"
A new normal,"Time travelers should prepare for tough sledding. If you went back to 1820 or even 1920, all the sudden changes would discombobulate you. And the same is true for someone who came forward to today.
We’ve got a deep-seated desire for things to go back to normal, the way we were used to.
But this, this moment of ours is now normal.
For now.
And then, there will be another normal.
There is no “thenew normal”. Because that’s definitive.
There’s simply the normal of now.
A new normal. This too shall pass.","September 1, 2020","new normal, change, time travel"
Absolute value,"It’s time for the annual window painting competition in my little town. Store owners allow kids to have a 2 foot by 4 foot piece of window to paint a scary/funny/punny Halloween billboard, and the winners get a certificate.
And every year, parents not only help, they often take over and do all the work.
The thing is: Not one of these entries, ever, has been the best in the world. None has been perfect or even worthy of hanging in a gallery. It’s not a worldwide absolute competition. It’s relative.
Relative to what you’re capable of.
You’re not running the race against everyone else. More often than not, you’re simply running it against yourself.

A/B/C and the problem with skipping a step,"Striving to be asleep is a difficult leap. On the other hand, committing to lying still is do-able. Lying still makes it more likely you’ll get to the next step.
Hoping to grow your business by word of mouth by willing your customers to talk about you isn’t nearly as productive as making something worth talking about.
Skipping a step is frustrating and usually futile.","October 30, 2020","A/B testing, business growth, mindfulness"
The successful scientist,"The scientific method is the most powerful invention humans have ever created. It’s not just for people in white coats and in labs. The scientific method has changed what we wear, what we eat, the health of our families, the way we earn a living–the world as we know it is a result of a simple process of hypothesis, testing and explanation.
Unfortunately, school and other systems in our world focus on just one or two of the elements necessary to do it well.
There are very few contentious arguments in our world today that couldn’t be more quickly resolved if all involved were willing to act in good faith and work their way through the steps together.
Because if you seek to lead or to change minds, if you’re working for better, then you’re a scientist.","October 29, 2020","scientific method, leadership, problem-solving"
“All anecdote and no data”,"That’s a criticism, of course. A report, study or testimony that’s all anecdote with no data carries little in the way of actionable information.
On the other hand, if you want to change people’s minds, “all data and no anecdote” isn’t going to get you very far.
We act on what we understand, we understand what fits into our worldview and we remember what we act on.","October 28, 2020","anecdote, data, understanding"
Back in the tube,"There are two kinds of mistakes.
One is the sort where failure is not noticeable because failure means that you didn’t engage with an audience. If you do an art show and no one comes, no one realizes that your art show failed.
The other is harder to walk away from. You can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube. When you engineer collateralized debt obligations that merge together mortgage streams, inextricably linking the healthy ones with the others, it’s a mistake with real consequences.
Confusing the two types of errors is a recipe for tragedy. If we can figure out how to organize and plan for the first type of resilient failure, it’s far easier to experiment.","October 27, 2020","mistakes, consequences, resilience"
Misgivings,"If you’re not having any second thoughts at all, it’s probably because you’re not thinking it through enough.
The hallmark of the true believer is that there’s no room for judgment. For everyone else, misgivings are a sign that you’re carefully considering the problem at hand.","October 26, 2020","Misgivings, Judgment, Consideration"
Popular vs. good,"They’re not the same.
We often strive to have both, but that’s unlikely. The price of having one almost certainly involves losing the other.  We often end up compromising something to get both and fail.
Better to have one than neither.","October 25, 2020","Popular, Good, Compromise"
The thing about sunk costs,"Tomorrow is another opportunity.
There are thirty people over there who are just waiting for you to help connect them, lead them or make things better. But if you’re still defending the stuck project over here, the one you put so much into, you won’t be able to show up for them.
Customers, partners, clients and students who need your voice or your product aren’t going to benefit from it because you’re working so hard to dig yourself out of a previous hole, a situation that is now harder than ever to work your way through.
It’s easy to focus on the problem right in front of us, and to decide that this problem, and only this problem, is the problem for us to solve. But there’s a cost to everything, and the opportunity lost when you’re doing this is just as real, even when you don’t notice it.
Of course, we don’t create contribution by flitting from one thing to another whenever things get difficult. But we also sell ourselves short (and harm the people we’d be able to serve) if we’re unable to quit a project that’s gone sideways.
What happened yesterday already happened. It’s a gift and an asset from your previous self. You don’t have to accept if you don’t want to.","October 24, 2020","sunk costs, opportunity, project management"
Big business vs. small business,"Small companies create almost all the jobs. They are the insurgents, the agents of change.
Big companies are a backbone, reliable providers of goods and services. Big companies operate at a scale that most of us can’t even imagine.
The two points of view often conflict. And each can learn from the other.
Net neutrality is an argument between freedom of innovation by small business vs. control from big business.
Campaign finance reform is an argument against big companies and their leaders buying the outcomes of elections.
It’s not always about capitalism vs. the alternative. It’s often about the status quo vs. what’s next.
Worth noting: A small business is not a big business that hasn’t grown up yet. It’s different. A small business has an owner, someone who can make decisions without meetings, who can listen to customers and who can embrace the work at hand.
If you run a small business, I hope you’ll check out thenew workshopfrom my friend and colleague Ramon Ray. The folks at Akimbo are working with Ramon to help connect small business people on their journey to making a bigger impact. It works better together.","October 23, 2020","small business, big business, innovation"
“That’s not what I meant”,"Disagreements among people who mean well usually begin with that emotion.
You meant to say something or agree to something, but the “other side” didn’t hear it that way.
That’s enough for a customer to walk away forever. That’s enough for a lawsuit. Because denying the experience of the other person doesn’t open the door for re-connection.
Forward motion is possible if we can extend the sentence to, “That’s not what I meant, but that must be what you heard, how do we fix this? Will you help me make things right again?”
If we can agree on intent, it’s a lot easier to figure out how to move forward.","October 22, 2020","communication, misunderstandings, reconciliation"
Cross the bridge and join the dragons,"53 years ago, early in her career, Joni Mitchell recorded thissong.
It’s not something most people will want to listen to often. Shortly after that, she became the one and only Joni Mitchell. But first, she had dues to pay.
That’s the work of practice and discernment and skill. You’re not born with genius, it’s a skill.

“I hate this restaurant”,"Back in the old days, I took someone to a local Italian restaurant for dinner.
As we looked over the menu, complete with regional specialties and handmade pastas, he started to sulk. With a sullen look, he said, “I want a hamburger and french fries.”
Somehow, the patient kitchen staff figured out how to produce this out of thin air, and a tantrum was narrowly averted. But I’ve been thinking about that interaction a lot.
In his mind, “restaurant” meant, “a place where I can get a hamburger and french fries.” If you look at many 1 star reviews (of books, of music, of restaurants) this is precisely what you’re going to see. A mismatch of expectations. A mismatch that is blamed, completely, on the person who created the work, not the critic.
It doesn’t matter that the thing was clearly marked. It doesn’t matter that the thing was extraordinarily well-produced. And it doesn’t matter if just about everyone else experiencing it was thoroughly delighted.
Because for this spoiled, under-informed and impatient patron, it failed.
This failure comes from a few contributing factors, all amplified by our culture:
First, you can’t know if you’re going to like an experience until you experience it. All you know is your understanding of what was on offer. And because there are so many choices and there’s so much noise, we rarely take the time to actually read the label, or we get carried away by the coming attractions, or we just don’t care enough to pay attention until we’re already involved.
[And marketers are complicit, because in the face of too much noise, they hype what’s on offer and overpromise…]
Second, because many people are afraid. They’re afraid of the new and even more than that, afraid of change. Most people in our culture would like to be entertained not transformed, lectured at instead of learning.
Third, the double-edged sword of giving everyone a microphone means that we’ve amplified the voices of dissent at the same time we’ve given people a chance to speak up about their desires. This means that mass culture is far more divisive than it ever was before, and it also means that bubbles of interest are more likely to be served.
And so the fork in the road:
You can either turn your operation into a cross between McDonald’s and Disney, selling theregular kind, pandering to the middle, putting everything in exactly the category they hoped for and challenging no expectations…
Or you can do the incredibly hard work of transgressing genres, challenging expectations and seeking out the few people who want to experience something that matters, instead of something that’s merely safe.",,"expectations, criticism, cultural shifts"
Better and cheaper,"That’s a pretty powerful combination. Some customers gravitate toward the option that offers ease, quality and convenience, while others prefer low price. If you can do both…
One way we’ve seen that done is with scale. Many people prefer the big box store to the local merchant. Not only is it often cheaper, but the selection might be dramatically better, the parking might be easier and in some rare cases, the service is better as well. How is this possible? Because volume pays off in almost every way that matters to the customer.
Another way is with proprietary insight. If a company has a production process, a patent or some other barrier, they can often deliver something faster and cheaper… a barrier that a competitor without that shortcut can’t overcome.
A third way is with herculean effort. When the people who work on the team simply care more. Caring is work, and caring is in short supply. An organization staffed with smart people who care can often run circles around a lazier competitor.
Most of the time, though, you’re probably unable to rely on one of these approaches. If that’s the case, the next best option is to choose. To actually be better (regardless of price) or to actually be cheaper. But pretending that you have both doesn’t work very well.
It costs a lot but it’s worth more than it costs.","October 19, 2020","1. Value

Unacceptable,"The word has a very specific meaning, which is why it’s so powerful.
If we accept behavior that’s unacceptable, we’re compromising on something that we thought was too important to compromise on.
And that’s how we end up with the unacceptable becoming commonplace.","October 18, 2020","unacceptable, compromise, behavior"
Two kinds of limbo,"Uncomfortable limbo happens when we’re seeking firm footing and there isn’t any. The discomfort comes from not knowing, from our unlimited desire to get through it to the other side.
And comfortable limbo is a place to hide. We lull ourselves into complacency, because the limbo of being in between feels safe, with no responsibilities.
Amazingly, two different people can experience the same limbo in totally different ways. It’s not the limbo that’s different, it’s us.","October 17, 2020","limbo, discomfort, perspective"
We like what we choose,"Not the other way around.
It feels safer to say that we’re born with talents and gifts, that we have a true calling, that we’re looking for what connects with our passion.
That’s not useful (because it means you spend a lot of time shopping around) but it’s also not true.
Newresearchconfirms that random choices lead to preferences, and then it follows that preferences lead to habits and habits lead us to become the person we somehow decide we were born to be.
If you had grown up somewhere else or some time else, there’s little doubt that you’d prefer something else. The things we think we need are simply the things we’re used to.
And if you like what you like simply because you have a pattern, that means that you might be able to like something else if you could develop new patterns.
In short: If we commit to loving what we do, we’re more likely to find engagement and satisfaction. And if what we do changes, we can choose to love that too.","October 16, 2020","choices, preferences, habits"
Two kinds of momentum,"There’s the unalterable momentum of physical objects as understood by physics: objects in motion tend to remain that way. A fast-moving baseball hitting your head hurts more than a lobbed one.
But usually, momentum is only conceptual, and it’s based on our habits and our difficulty in understanding (and ignoring) sunk costs. We stick with a pattern, a leader, an employee or a project much longer than we should.
The behavior that keeps someone from getting hired is trivial compared to what it takes to get fired. And at some level, that makes sense. When we’re not committed yet, the cost of looking around and switching our choice is small. But once we’ve emotionally committed to a cause or a project or a person, the cost of change is high, partly because it involves feeling as though we made a mistake.
But compounding that initial choice by doubling down on it is the actual mistake.
Digging a deeper hole rarely gets us to the other side.","October 15, 2020","momentum, commitment, sunk costs"
Show no work,"There are two sorts of projects.
In the first, you’ll need to show your work. Show us why the logic holds up. Tell us how this has happened before. Explain the best practices you’ve learned from and the standards you’re following.
In the second, you’re taking a leap. Simply guessing or going on instinct.
Either path can work, the problem is when we confuse them. Perhaps we’re doing something that is based on what’s come before, but we refuse to examine, measure or compare, insisting that history doesn’t apply. Or worse, when we’re going on instinct and assert that it’s actually a reliable, proven path forward.
If the stakes are high and the outcome needs to be reliable, we hope you’ll be able to show your work.
And when it comes to the part of the project that’s yours and yours alone, the part that isn’t based on what’s come before, show no work. And plan accordingly.","October 14, 2020","projects, logic, instincts"
The power of community and the trap of opt-out,"In Colonial America, they had private fire departments. If you didn’t voluntarily pay your dues, the firemen wouldn’t put out a fire–they’d watch your house burn and make sure it didn’t spread to your neighbor’s house.[or this!]
While this is a vivid way to ensure that everyone pays their dues, it’s such an inefficient way to support the fire department that it was replaced with the smarter alternative: a smaller tax on everyone, automatically collected. Even if a few manage to avoid paying their share, the blanket protection, which also leads to fire inspectors and building codes, clearly makes the case for universal protection.
We don’t let citizens opt out of paying their taxes, because community works better when group consensus leads to group action. It’s more efficient to provide services this way, and far more important, it creates a culture of ‘us’, which changes behavior from selfish to generous.
There’s a balance, neither extreme works. It’s up to us to think hard about where the (unstable, hard to find) balance lies.","October 13, 2020","community, tax, cooperation"
Persistently irrational,"When people around you do something that makes no sense or is self-defeating, it might not be because they’re stupid.
It’s more likely that they don’t believe what you believe, don’t see what you see or don’t want what you want. It might be different measures of time, of status or desire. If we hope to understand behavior, and ultimately to change it, we need to see the stories behind it.
Because, in many ways, we’re all irrational sometimes.","October 12, 2020","irrationality, understanding behavior, perspectives"
Figure and ground,"When does it snap into focus?
Because we don’t like to be wrong.
And more than that, we don’t like to be confused.
So when we encounter something new, we pause for a second until we think we get it. Then we lock it in, and it’s ours.
But what if we’re wrong?
What if our understanding of what we encountered wasn’t useful, accurate or true?
Suddenly, there’s a conflict. A conflict between being wrong and being confused. Because the only way to stop being wrong is to be momentarily confused. To jump from one state to another.
The magic is in waiting a few beats before you lock it in. Getting comfortable with ‘confused’ is a stepping stone on the path to becoming wise.","October 11, 2020","figure and ground, confusion, wisdom"
It turns out that ‘beiger’ isn’t a word,"Perhaps it should be, given how much time is spent trying to make things more and more beige.
Bland is not a helpful goal.
The goal could be to become useful, remarkable and worth seeking out. To do something that’s hard to replace, groundbreaking or thrilling. Generous work that makes things better.

Once you realize that you can improve, amplify and refine the things that other people call attitudes, you may realize that they are skills.
Which is great news, because becoming better at a skill is something we’re able to do.
Some people call these, “soft skills.” That’s because they’re not easy to measure. But for me, they’re real skills. The skills that actually determine how far we’ll go and how it will feel to work with us as we move forward.
Akimbo is hosting the third Real Skills Conference on Saturday, October 17 from 3 to 5 pm ET. You can find all the detailshere.
It’s truly a conference. No keynotes, no experts, simply a group of people who want to understand what it means to level up by seeing what’s possible and then deciding to do something about it. If spending an afternoon with people like that in service of making a difference would be helpful, I hope you can join in.",,"Attitudes, Skills, Conference"
The cold open,"No one ever bought anything on an elevator. The elevator pitch isn’t about selling your idea, because a metaphorical elevator is a lousy place to make a pitch.
When you feel like you’re being judged and only have a minute to make a first impression, it’s tempting to try to explain the truth and nuance of who you are, what you’ve done and what you’re going to do in the time it takes to travel a few floors.
That rarely works.
The alternative is the elevator question, not the elevator pitch. To begin a conversation–not about you, but about the person you’re hoping to connect with. If you know who they are and what they want, it’s a lot more likely you can figure out if they’re a good fit for who you are and what you want. And you can take the opportunity to help them find what they need, especially if it’s not from you.
Too often, we feel rejected when in fact, all that’s happened is a mismatch of needs, narratives and what’s on offer.
Instead of looking at everyone as someone who could fund you or buy from you or hire you, it might help to imagine that almost no one can do those things, but there are plenty of people you might be able to help in some other way, even if it’s only to respect them enough to not make a pitch.
No one wants to be hustled.","October 8, 2020","elevator question, first impression, connection"
The clarity (and risk) of graphs,"You might not agree with something you read on the front page of theWall Street JournalorThe New York Times, but at least you understand it. There’s simply no way a sentence like this would make it through the editing process: “Are we not pure? “No, sir!” Panama’s moody Noriega brags. “It is garbage!” Irony dooms a man—a prisoner up to new era.”
And yet, major publications continue to post graphs and charts that are nonsensical and redundant at the same time.
Following their lead, we’re busy putting similar junk in our presentations and brochures as well.
Consider this one from a recent issue of theTimes. (click to enlarge)
Why are the months on the vertical axis? Why is it symmetrical, repeating all the information?
Most important… what is it trying to say?
If you don’t know what you’re trying to say, not saying it with a graph is a good way to hide.

Better clients,"That’s it. Two words.
If you’re a freelancer, that’s the hard part. The important part. The part that will open the door to the work you seek to do.
Better clients challenge you. They support you. They spread the word. They pay on time. They pay more and expect more.
Everything else will take care of itself if you focus on getting better clients.
It’s possible, but alas, unlikely, that better clients will simply appear. That outsiders will realize how hard you’re working and will show up. Alas, while it may seem unfair, it turns out that you don’t get better clients simply by working hard. It’s much more productive to take the steps necessary to attract them and keep them instead.

Today’s the best day to sign up forThe Freelancer’s Workshop. The team at Akimbo is running it again because it works. It will change the way you do your work, whatever sort of freelancing you do. The Akimbo secret isn’t the videos, it’s the ability to learn together.

The first rule of the game,"“All players must agree to not cheat.”
It’s simply too difficult to enumerate all the rules necessary to engage with people who don’t have goodwill about the process. If you want to cheat, you’ll figure out how to cheat.
When all the players enroll in the spirit of the game, the game works. No matter what the game is.
Cultures and industries change. They often embrace the idea of fairness and a mutual respect for agreed-upon rules. But, over time, the spirit of the game can fade–and it incurs a cost on all the participants, because it’s difficult to move forward if you’re not sure what the rules actually are.
As the stakes have risen in marketplaces–of ideas, of commerce, of governance–it’s become more acceptable to play to win while cheating. To buy a slot on a bestseller list, to coerce or to collude, or to rig an outcome of one sort or another.
No one wants to be hustled.
Breaking the first rule ensures that the rest of the systems will be under great stress. Let’s play or let’s not play. But cheaters aren’t welcome.","October 5, 2020","cheating, fairness, integrity"
What does it mean to be smart?,"Termites and squirrels are successful. They’ve persisted through millennia, and they do things to survive that we could never figure out. They have good instincts. But they’re not smart, not smart in the sense that we hope a leader or a colleague will be.
That kind of smart requires you to be open about how you do your work, how you make choices and the sort of change you seek to make in the world. There’s no need for a smart person to change the story or be evasive or lie, because that’s not part of being smart.
You want a smart heart surgeon, because she can tell you preciselywhyshe’s going to do one procedure instead of another one.
This kind of smart also requires domain knowledge. Smart people havedone the reading, and they understand what has come before. They know that history doesn’t repeat itself, but it rhymes. And they’re not interested in making a mistake that they could have avoided with informed preparation.
And a smart person, in addition to revealing their methods and goals, and being alert as to what works, most of all, will change their methods and goals based on what they’ve learned.
Look around you. If you’re seeing buildings that don’t fall down, public health systems that are functioning and products that delight you, it’s because a smart person did the difficult work of creating them.","October 4, 2020","Smartness, Knowledge, Adaptability"
Walking away from the idée fixe,"“It’s going to be exactly like THIS. It has to be, and I don’t want to hear otherwise. Don’t you believe in me?”
The wedding with the perfect dress, the perfect cake, the perfect groom. It doesn’t matter that the family, the finances and yes, our spouse all don’t want it.
The business with the famous venture capitalist behind it, the IPO, the business model. It doesn’t matter if the people we seek to serve can’t support that.
The musical career with a debut at Carnegie Hall, the glowing reviews and the fancy record deal. It doesn’t matter that the practice and the compromises make you unhappy…
There are industries in place that groom us to do things a certain way. Not because it’s good for us or our mission, but because it’s easier or more profitable for them.
In fact, you can make a ruckus online without venture funding (most people who do don’t have it). In fact, you can have a happy marriage without a big wedding. And in fact, you can happily write your novel without Random House publishing it.
I know you’ve been proving the naysayers wrong for so long that by now it feels like a regular part of the journey. It’s entirely possible, though, that the folks who are pointing out that the industry’s path might not beyourpath have a point.
For every person who has proven the skeptics wrong, there are a hundred who should have listened to them and done the work they cared about instead of keeping track of the wrong metrics.

The arc and the arch,"They sound similar, but they’re not.
An arc, like an arch, is bent. The strength comes from that bend.
But the arc doesn’t have to be supported at both ends, and the arc is more flexible. The arc can take us to parts unknown, yet it has a trajectory.
An arch, on the other hand, is a solid structure. It’s a bridge that others have already walked over.
Our life is filled with both. We’re trained on arches, encouraged to seek them out.
But an arc, which comes from “arrow,” is the rare ability to take flight and to go further than you or others expected.","October 2, 2020","arc, arch, flexibility"

The monopoly distinction,"At enlightened companies, leaders are smart enough to ask, “how do we make things better for our customers?” They realize that this simple ratchet leads to loyalty, word of mouth and more customers.

The persistence of hierarchy and status roles,"REM was one of the most respected indy rock bands. You’d think that a group that somehow managed to thread the needle between whatever authentic means to them and huge popular success could walk away from traditional measures of who’s up and who’s not…
In a long-ago Rolling Stonearticle, lead singer Michael Stipe said that he had never heard a song from Mariah Carey and in fact had just learned how to say her name. There’s a difference between focusing on your lane and denigrating the others in your field.
In the same article, bandmate Michael Mills expresses disappointment that even though they recorded at Prince’s studio in Minneapolis, he never stopped by to say hello or even invite them to the party on Friday.
Turtles all the way down,turtlesall the way up.
High school persists.
It’s possible to use the status hierarchy as a sort of fuel, a way to motivate yourself to push a little harder. But it is also possible, and far more resilient, to use connection and possibility as fuel as well.
The best lesson of high school might be that everyone has a noise in their heads, everyone feels uncomfortable and everyone would appreciate a little kindness and respect.","November 29, 2020","Hierarchy, Connection, Kindness"
"More popular (and cheap, too)","If Harper Lee had writtenTo Kill a Mockingbirdtoday, there’s no doubt that the salesforce and the marketers would have pushed for a catchier title, probably with better SEO.

On a similar note: What would happen if instead of taking elements out of our work in order to make the product cheaper, we put things in instead? What if we made it better?
It’s tempting to race to the bottom. The problem is that you might win, and then you’ll have to stay there. Worse, you might try and come in second, accomplishing not much of anything.
Linkbait is a trap, because it brings you attention you actually don’t want.
The alternative is to be idiosyncratic, specific and worth the effort and expense. What would happen if you made something important, breathtaking or wonderful? The race to the top is not only more satisfying, it’s also more likely to work.

The grateful pumpkin,"It might not be autumn where you live, but the iconography of the large orange pumpkin travels around the world.
People carve faces into them, stick a candle inside and use them to ward off the darkness.
Perhaps we could consider writing on one instead. Inscribing all the things we’re grateful for, all the people who show up in our lives. We could highlight our heroes, our friends, the selfless people who show up for the community instead of simply looking for a shortcut… We could even remind ourselves of the systems, situations and dynamics that we take for granted.
Seeing that pumpkin every day is a great way to remind myself of how extraordinarily lucky I am. Even when it seems as though the news is an unending litany of selfishness and tragedy, it’s possible to find someone who made a difference.
Thank you for caring, for showing up and especially, for leading.","November 26, 2020","gratitude, pumpkin, thankfulness"
Butterfly hunting,"Ideas are like that.
The successful editor, curator or entrepreneur doesn’t go hunting ideas to kill them, but to celebrate them, identify them and dance with them.
And a brutal, all-out frontal attack won’t work. It’s not about raising a ton of money or insisting that the world supply you with only the good ideas. Quibi failed because of the hubris of believing that the ideas could be conjured on a schedule. And countless middlemen have struggled with the dead-end of only wanting to embrace the good ideas, which are often impossible to distinguish from the others at a distance.
Sometimes, you need to look more closely, to reconsider or to circle around again.
And sometimes we go butterfly hunting and find nothing at all.
Fred Hills, who published fiftyNew York Timesbestsellers (including my first one) died a few weeks ago. He took the quest literally, and used to go butterfly hunting with Nabakov. His belief in my book was matched by the trust he offered me and so many authors to find our voice and share it.
Chris Meyerwas another butterfly hunter, patiently connecting, leading and challenging, turning on lights in a way that made everyone in the room see the possibilities that lay just ahead.
The ideas are there. It might take patience to nurture them.

Subconscious pre-filtering,"It’s entirely possible to believe that your ideas come from the muse, and your job is to simply amplify them. And that successful people are lucky because the muse keeps giving them useful and powerful ideas.
I’m not sure that’s what successful people do. All of us get an endless supply of ideas, notions and inklings. Successful people, often without realizing it, ignore the ones that are less likely to ‘work’, and instead focus on the projects that are more likely to advance the mission.
It’s possible to get better at this pre-filtering. By doing it out loud. By writing out the factors that you’re seeking, by explaining to someone else how your part of the world works.
Instinct is great. It’s even better when you work on it.
You can find more on this inThe Practice, my new bestselling book.

"A paradox of community, belief and reality","Belief happens when we combine community with emotion. It’s a way for us to see and understand the world, at the same time that we engage with some of the people around us. Belief is a symptom of shared connection, and community makes us human.
Reality, on the other hand, is widely experienced and consistent. Gravity doesn’t care if you believe in it or not, it’s still here. And that jar of jelly beans has the same number of beans in it, no matter how many times we count them.
When belief doesn’t match our experience of reality, stress occurs.
This stress can surprisingly make community stronger. There’s very little community among people who believe that the Earth is a sphere, no meetings or conventions of the round Earth people. That’s because you don’t need belief to know that the Earth is round.
There is a long history of building community cohesion by encouraging members to ignore the facts of the world around them.
The disconnect between what’s out there and the emotions that lead us to believe something that isn’t real can actually make a community tighter. Sometimes, the disconnect between belief and reality is precisely the point. When the disconnect gets really large and the community becomes more insulated, cults arise.
But in our modern age, this stressful disconnect between belief and reality also makes it difficult to spread the word. The outsider may be hesitant to sign up for the stress that belief in non-real things can cause.
As more and more information is just a click away, and as our culture fractures into a long-tail of filter bubbles, the chasms between belief and reality become more profound. But beliefs change, and reality persists, and so the cycles continue.","November 20, 2020","community, belief, reality"

“Until further notice”,"Of course,everyrule, every announcement and every policy is in place until further notice.
We say it as a form of throat clearing. A way to make the announcement seem more official and specific. We repeat the redundant as a form of gift wrap, a way to be sure that it feels both urgent and impersonal.
“May I have your attention please” is another wasted phrase that is actually self-cancelling on inspection. In this case, it acknowledges that attention is being taken, whether you want to loan it out or not.
This patina of bureaucratic civility exists to let the bureaucrat off the hook. But it also is a signal to the listener that an official is speaking up. We should use it (or not use it) with full knowledge of the signal we’re sending.
It’s the seat belt training video, the do not remove tag on our mattress, the ‘your call is important’ filler on hold and the ritual of singing a not-very-good song to people we care about every single year.
If you look around the built world, you’ll find these tropes and filigrees just about everywhere. As media changes, we strip away the old ones and invent new ones to fill their spot. Use them (or not) as a way of sending a message of awareness and authority.","November 17, 2020","bureaucracy, communication, tropes"
The right answer,"Which is better: Feeling like you were right the first time or actually being correct now?
When we double down on our original estimate, defend our sunk costs and rally behind the home team, we’re doing this because it’s satisfying to feel as though we were right all along.
On the other hand, if the outcome is important and we’re brave enough to learn, we can say, “based on what we know now, we should change course, because the other path is actually a better way to go forward.”
More often than not, there are moments when we’re wrong. We can either acknowledge that we were wrong yesterday, or we can curse ourselves by choosing to be wrong going forward.

The incoming,"Standing at my desk this summer, it had just turned 10 am, and I realized that I’d already:
Heard from an old friend, engaged with three team members on two continents, read 28 blogs across the spectrum AND found out about the weather and the news around the world.
Half my life ago, in a similar morning spent in a similar office, not one of those things would have been true.
The incoming (and our ability to create more outgoing) is probably the single biggest shift that computers have created in our work lives. Sometimes, we subscribe or go and fetch the information, and sometimes it comes to us, unbidden and unfiltered. But it’s there and it’s compounding.
One option is to simply cope with the deluge, to be a victim of the firehose.
Another is to make the problem worse by adding more noise and spam to the open networks that we depend on.
A third might be, just for an hour, to turn it off. All of it. To sit alone and create the new thing, the thing worth seeking out, the thing that will cause a positive change.","November 13, 2020","incoming information, digital overload, focused creation"
The gift of results,"When Ignaz Semmelweis pioneered statistics in order to save countless women from dying in childbirth, his fellow doctors refused to believe him. They ignored his work, didn’t wash their hands and it was another twenty years before his insights on the spread of disease were adopted.
We live in a faster, more competitive world than he did.
When Jethro Tull wrote about the rotation of crops, many farmers continued to do things in the old way. Over time, though, the yields don’t lie. You don’t have to like the idea, but you can see that it works.
Results show up. They’re easy to see, easy to measure and they persist.
The bridge falls down or it doesn’t. Market share goes up or it doesn’t.
We can view results as a threat, or see them as an opportunity. It depends on whether we’re defending a little-understood status quo or seeking to make things work better.
Results don’t care about our explanation. We need a useful explanation if we’re going to improve, but denying the results doesn’t change them.
As the world has become ever more filled with results, it has crowded out each individual’s personal narrative of how the world works. Particularly in times of change and negative outcomes, this can cause a lot of distress.
Our narrative is ours, and it informs who we are and the story we tell ourselves.
Beliefs are powerful. They’re personal. They can have a significant impact on the way we engage with ourselves and others. But results are universal and concrete, and no matter how much we’d like them to go away, there they are.
When people talk about how modernity has changed humanity, they often overlook the fundamental impact that results have had. Competitive environments create more results, at greater speed, and those results compound over time.
We still need a narrative and we still need our individual outlook. But over the last century, we’ve had to make more and more room for the systems that create results. Our shared reality demands it.","November 12, 2020","Results, Narrative, Change"
Second cousins,"Being smart often has little to do with being persuasive.
And yet we often assume that one leads to the other.
We spend years and years educating people to do well on tests in the belief that this will make them smart.
And we assume that they’ll figure out the persuasive stuff on their own.
We conflate the two on a regular basis, assuming that charisma or followers or influence is somehow aligned with insight, foresight, and learning.
The good news is that being persuasive is a skill. If you’re smart, we’ll all benefit if you’ll also invest the effort to find a way to lead.","November 11, 2020","persuasion, education, charisma"
A theatre of dominance,"Organized sports often turn into a play about status roles and dominance. Bullfighting, pro wrestling, even hockey, are about who’s winning, who’s losing and who’s in charge.
But they are also theatres of affiliation. The fans celebrate their unity as well as their divisions. The pomp and circumstance are a form of culture. There are insiders and outsiders, and the right way and the wrong way.
When a sumo champ breaksprotocol, the crowd isn’t happy. When the people next to you are wearing the same jersey as you, neither of you is headed onto the ice, but both of you feel like you belong.
The symphony has the same elements. The affiliation of players in tune, of familiar music from the canon, of an audience that knows not to clap between movements. But it’s also the dominance of the European-trained conductor, bringing his passion and will to bend the performance to his wishes.
One way to understand what’s happening in the office or on the news is to look at it through these lenses.
The theatre of affiliation happens when groupthink sets in, when we’re wondering what others will think of a new idea, when we go out of our way to play the long game and to be kind and thoughtful. “People like us do things like this.”
And this always dances with the theatre of dominance, when we see someone shortcutting to gain market share, or subjecting a co-worker to abuse in a meeting. It leads to a reinforcement of caste and stereotypes, and yet it persists. “I’m winning.”
Affiliation is the infinite game of culture building, sustainability, cooperation and resilience.
Dominance is an instinct as well, something we see in many successful species, and particularly when the game that’s being played is tweaked to reward dominators, it often returns.
When you’re in one mode, it’s tempting to believe that everyone else is too. But depending on which pocket of culture you’re in, which ticket you bought, what state your persona is in, it might be that you’re not seeing what others are seeing.
Getting in sync requires doing the emotional work of changing state long before we start using words and rational concepts. When in doubt, assume the people over there might be engaging in a different sort of theatre than you are.","November 10, 2020","1. Dominance

Launches and orbits,"The launch is fraught. It takes a lot of energy to get the thing started, and the orbit is the goal–there are still satellites up there, circling, decades after launching.
Even after twenty of them, a book launch feels uncertain. After all, you’re asking people to add one more thing to their reading list, something that no one has read yet. It’s an act of trust and kindness and support that I still don’t take for granted.
Thank you.
Launches are often characterized by a rush, a series of shortcuts and not enough patience. But it turns out that a successful launch often takes years, because the leaps we ask people to take require trust and confidence.

The unspoken questions,"Before we make a decision, we wonder about our dreams, our stories and our needs. Some of the things we wonder about, even if we don’t verbalize them to ourselves:
What will I tell my friends?
What will I tell my boss?
What is everyone else doing?
Will this make me feel dumb?
Is this good for me right now?
Does it help my family?
Is it scarce?
Does it raise my status?
Will this help me be part of a group I care about?
Would my mom be proud of me?
Will I get blamed?
Is there a shortcut?
Is it safe?
Is it thrilling?

The useful crisis,"The Cuban Missile Crisis was an actual crisis. The world was hours away from being annihilated–gone forever, all of us.
Since then, the media has exploited (and invented) crises on a regular basis, now more than ever, often at the expense of focusing our attention on chronic conditions, which are the real challenges.
Today’s election day in the US, and the whole world is watching. Even with mail-in voting, it’s mostly a one-day thing. A useful crisis, a chance to encourage millions of people to get involved, at least a little. The last time around, only 80,000 votes separated the outcome, a truly tiny fraction of the population who didn’t show up and vote but could have.
While the Tonkin crisis accelerated the US’s involvement in Vietnam, it was the chronic and persistent war that truly took a toll. We notice the amplified moments but the long haul is often invisible. And media like Twitter make it 140 times worse.
A crisis doesn’t have to be a negative event. A wedding is a crisis–one ceremony, one day, over and done. All eyes, all attention, all on this moment. That’s why we do it–even though the chronic condition of the marriage itself is always more important. And we do the same thing for job interviews and product launches as well.
Today’s the launch day for my new book,The Practice. People asked me why I would waste the focus and crisis of a launch on a day when everyone is going to be talking about something else. I did it partly because I know you can handle two things at once, and would probably want to find something to fill your time while you were waiting for the results. And mostly becauseThe Practiceis about the long haul, the persistent posture of creation and possibility. I’d love to have an exciting launch day (I’ll be posting some hoopla details later today) but I’m far more interested in what the people who go first do with the book after they read it. Tomorrow, next month and next year.
It doesn’t make sense to waste a good crisis, but it also hurts us when we are only concerned with them.
Please vote today if you can, and then let’s all try to find a way to work together to figure out how to focus on the persistent, chronic conditions that we can each do something about.

What do you get and what does it cost?,"This is pretty easy to discuss when we’re discussing buying an ice cream sandwich. It costs $2, you get an ice cream sandwich.
It gets a little more nuanced when we talk about what $2 means to you, what the freedom to choose is worth, the guilt or joy you get from eating a sugary dessert all on your own, the fun of sharing it with a friend, your narrative about hormones and livestock… Maybe it’s not that easy after all.
And so we get to the sometimes subtle calculation of voting.
Tomorrow in the US is voting day. It apparently doesn’t cost anything to vote–just a few minutes of time. But it actually can feel like it costs a lot, because it comes with cognitive load, with decision making, with a feeling of power or futility or connection or loneliness. If you don’t vote, it’s a lot easier to deny any responsibility.
A year ago, I was standing in line at an ice cream stand in Syracuse, NY. A person in front of me took more than two minutes (a long time when it’s a long line!) to make up their mind, and even let two other people jump ahead because it was so hard (which means, also, so fun) to be undecided. That’s a choice, and the date certain of voting pushes us to move through that state…
But along with these costs, voting comes with the feeling of participation. Even if you don’t think your vote counts, others do. People are paying attention, and over time, it adds up.
And it comes with the feeling of generosity, because you can vote to advance the well-being of someone who needs to be seen even more than you do.
If you’re a habitual non-voter, it’s worth wondering for a moment about the calculation you use to keep that streak going, and perhaps consider exploring the feelings that come when you break that streak.
Not just tomorrow, but in all the ways, and on all the days, when we don’t speak up, don’t raise our hands and don’t vote.","November 2, 2020","voting, decision-making, participation"
"Omission, commission and the places in between","If you accidentally leave the gate open and foragers end up destroying 1000 acres of crops, the guilt feels different than if you went and actively burned down the fields, even if the damage is identical.
In our society, we treat errors of omission differently from the decision to commit a crime.
But there are countless places in between.
What if you should have known?
What if you could have known but didn’t bother to do the work?
What if you promised you’d do the work to find a path, but then didn’t?
One reason we hide is that we’re afraid of being on the hook, of making a promise we can’t keep, of showing up and taking responsibility for our intentional actions. But, as information becomes more widespread and our leverage increases, we’ve already put ourselves on the hook. Could, should and would not only rhyme, they exist on a continuum.","November 1, 2020","Omission, Responsibility, Accountability"
Toward better,"Well, that was interesting. Tragic. Heartbreaking. Painful. Difficult.
Have more people ever been happier to see a year go away? I’m posting this a few hours early just to clear the decks a bit faster.
Our attitude doesn’t have to be driven by the outside world, but sometimes, they overlap. The outside world provokes, persists and insists on changing the story we choose to tell ourselves.
And one reason we invented the calendar was to keep the outside world at bay as we reclaim agency over how we’ll choose to act–to respond instead of to react.
For those of you keeping track, 2021 is the product of the prime numbers 43 and 47. If you were looking for a reason to be optimistic, that’s as good as any.

A different urgency,"For many people, work consists of a series of urgencies. Set them up and knock them down. Empty the in-box, answer the boss, make the deadline.
Over the next few weeks, there may be fewer urgencies than usual. That’s the nature of coming back from a break.
What if we used the time to move system deficiencies from the “later” pile to the “it’s essential to do this right now” pile?
Improving a system returns our effort many times over.
Fix your supply chain. Dig deep into your communication rhythms. Figure out the priority list. Quit the tasks that are holding you back. Walk away from dead ends. Add rigor to your processes. Understand the difference between the things that feel urgent and those that are truly important.
None of this works if you do it temporarily. The point is to create and fix systems with finality. Identify a class of projects that your team will do instead of you and then never do them again. Reorganize your data archiving approach and then stick with it. Build a system for lifelong learning and then maintain the commitment.
In any given moment, an urgency that feels like an emergency gives us the permission to abandon our systems and simply dive in and fix it, as only we can. And this permission is precisely why we get stuck, precisely why the next urgency is likely to appear tomorrow.
Resolutions don’t work. Habits and systems can.
Most of us are so stuck on the short-cycles of urgency that it’s difficult to even imagine changing our longer-term systems.
Amazingly, this simple non-hack (in which you spend the time to actually avoid the shortcuts that have been holding you back) might be the single most effective work you do all year.","December 30, 2020","urgency, systems, improvement"

Cleaning out the fridge after a power failure, I found three half-empty containers of anchovies. Because they magically migrate to the back of the fridge, every time I had needed some, I ended up opening a new jar, because the old ones were invisible. Not just invisible if I had looked for them, but so invisible that it never even occurred to me to look for them.
And this is even more likely to happen with the data on your hard drive. If you don’t know to look for it, if you don’t believe it’s there, it might as well be deleted.

Stand up and fight,"One of Woody Guthrie’s resolutions was to “Wake up and fight.”
But he wasn’t talking about being a bully. Or picking a fight at the local bar.
He was talking about changing the culture.
He was challenging himself to push back against the doubters, and even more than that, to overcome his own self-doubt.

Amplify possibility,"“People like us do things like this.”
Social media understands this.
It also knows that people like points, likes and something that feels like popularity.
The social media companies optimized their algorithms for profit. And profit, they figured, would come from engagement. And engagement, they figured, would come from confounding our instincts and rewarding outrage.
Because outrage draws a crowd.
And crowds establish culture.
And a desire to be the leader of a crowd reinforced the cycle.
And so the social networks created a game, a game in which you ‘win’ by being notorious, outrageous or, as they coined the phrase, “authentic.” The whole world is watching, if you’re willing to put on a show.
That’s not how the world actually works. The successful people in your community or your industry (please substitute ‘happy’ for successful in that sentence) don’t act the way the influencers on Twitter, YouTube or Facebook do. That’s all invented, amplified stagecraft, it’s not the actual human condition.
Many of us have an overwhelming need to rubberneck, to slow down when we pass a crash on the highway. This is odd, as most people don’t go out of their way to visit the morgue, just for kicks. And yet…
I hope we’d agree that if people started staging car crashes on the side of the road to get attention, we’d be outraged.
That’s what happening, and the leaders of social networks pretend that they can’t do a thing about it, just as Google pretends that they can’t control the results of their search algorithm.
The shift that the leaders of the social networks need to make is simple. In the long run, it will cost them nothing. And within weeks, it will create a world that’s calmer, happier and more productive.
Amplify possibility. Dial down the spread of disinformation, trolling and division. Make it almost impossible to get famous at the expense of civilization. Embrace the fact that breaking news doesn’t have to be the rhythm of our days. Reward thoughtfulness and consistency and responsibility.
You can do this. Enough already.","December 26, 2020","social media, engagement, responsibility"

The seeds we plant,"2020 was a terrible year for too many people. So much trauma, dislocation and illness. Everyone has their own stories, and everyone suffered (unevenly and unfairly) from the extraordinary shifts in our lives.
And yet, seeds were planted. Five or ten or twenty years from now, people will remember projects that were started, connections that were established, realizations that occurred. Doors were opened, babies were born and changes were made.
Few people celebrate forest fires, but we’re all eager to walk through the sylvan glades that follow.
If you were kept from planting all the seeds you hoped to in 2020, that’s okay. Because the best time to plant more seeds is always right now. Or perhaps tomorrow.

Did it do what it was supposed to do?,"That’s not often the same as, “I did my best.”
Quality has a very specific definition: Did it meet the customer’s requirements?
Any experience, product or deliverable that meets that spec is deemed to have met the quality standard. If it doesn’t, it’s not of quality.
And so we need to begin with,“who’s it for?”because the customer might not be who we think it is.
“Was it a good wedding?” might mean, “did the host feel fully seen, empowered and celebrated?” or it might mean, “did you have fun?” or it might mean twenty other things.
The second question goes along with that, which is,“what’s it for?”This product or experience, what did the customer hire it to do? Again, being clear about this is the only way to improve what we’re doing.
Only after we answer these two questions can we dig into how to be more clear about what we’re offering and to whom, along with how we can make our work more effective and efficient.
[And then it gets complicated…]
What if there’s more than one “who”? What if instead of trying to please one customer, you have a variety of customers? Or if there are internal constituents, or non-paying entities who have a say in it?
What if you try to do it again? Which elements could be improved? Become more efficient? Have less impact on the workforce or the environment? Become more reliable?
And what if the organization is more than just a few people? Where do processes, supply chain management and systems come into play?

"Guests, hosts and landlords","The landlord acts like he owns the place, because he does. The landlord makes the rules and has the power to enforce them.
The host acts on behalf of those that are being served. “Gracious” is the goal.
And guests realize that they’re in a fortunate position and try not to abuse it.
As Dave Winer has pointed out, the web has no owner. We’re all guests, except when we have a chance to be a host. Acting like a landlord is counter to what makes the whole thing work.

Beyond a shadow,"How certain do you need to be?

In our vigilance to avoid blunders, sometimes we try to eliminate mistakes as well.
For understandable reasons, we spend a lot of time trying to avoid blunders and minimizing mistakes. But if that’s all we do, we’ve given up the chance to do something magical.
If you’re working on the frontier, if you’re leading, creating or inventing, you’ve signed up for mistakes. That’s the price of innovation.

What’s your game?,"Someone who plays Monopoly every week, and always uses the little silver hat as their playing piece and always buys Boardwalk if he can–he may think that this is his game.
That’s way too literal.
Someone who trades pork bellies on the floor of the commodities exchange might believe that she has a particular affinity to pork bellies, and that the specific is the game.
Still too literal.
In the first case, the ‘game’ isn’t the silver hat, the properties or even the Monopoly set. The game is the way it feels to engage with the regular group and the thrill of trading and perhaps winning. It would be possible to replicate or even surpass this game by playing Othello instead, or scouring garage sales to sell hidden treasures on eBay…
In the second case, the ‘game’ might actually be the thrill of the trade. Or it might be the satisfaction the trader gets from having an easily measured indicator (wealth) go up. Or it might be the status that comes from being richer than the folks you went to high school with…
We invent all sorts of trappings and decide that the trappings are our work. They’re not. There are only a handful of games that most people decide to play… games that have boundaries, other players, connections and outcomes. You can switch from one set of trappings to another much more easily than you imagine, particularly if you focus on the basic building blocks of your game instead of the outward appearance.
If someone takes away your playing piece, don’t fall into the trap of deciding you can’t play a game any longer.
If someone tries to persuade you that the game is to make as much money as possible, realize that they need more insight and imagination.
Whenever you can, it might pay to seek to create a game that works for you and for those you seek to serve. Because those games are the sustainable ones and the ones that you can play for a long time to come.","December 17, 2020","game, engagement, sustainability"

Your story doesn’t have to be a book, it is simply your chance to make a difference. “Here’s what I see, here’s how you can be part of it.”
When we remove the pre (finding the pen, the paper, the notebook, the software) and the post (finding a way to publish it), it turns out that we write more often, and writing more often leads to writing better.

Seeing differently,"Here are some books for the end of the year… fifty years of ideas that have helped me understand the world differently:
Gödel, Escher, Bach— Before meta was cool, Douglas Hofstadter won a Pulitzer Prize for this intricately created examination of math, art and music.
Caste— My book of the year. Wilkerson helps us see how persistent and hidden the indoctrination of race and status lie in our culture.
Understanding Comics— Another meta book, and a masterpiece of explanation and insight.
The Red Queen— There are a ton of very cool books on evolutionary theory and this one is particularly good.
Knocking on Heaven’s Door— Lisa Randall’s explanation of physics will change the way you look at the world.
Guns, Germs and Steel— Another classic, it has earned its spot in the canon. An explanation (not without controversy) of how the world ended up as it did. This is what the study of geography is actually about.
The Beginning of Infinity— After you read Randall, this book will take those ideas and expand them. A lot.
Impro— This book transformed the way I saw human interaction, and had a significant impact in the creation ofThis is Marketing.
What Technology Wants— Kevin Kelly has changed my mind over and over again, and this one is the one I think about the most often.
The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas— A short story from Ursula LeGuin that you will never forget.
Debt— An astonishing look at 5,000 years of human history by the late David Graeber.
The Jazz of Physics— A great book, even (especially) for people who think they don’t like either.
When Things Fall Apart— Each of Pema’s books is special, and the audio books in particular. This is a fine place to start.
Books are an extraordinary device, transitioning through time and space, moving from person to person and leaving behind insight and connection. I’m grateful every single day for the privilege of being able to read (and to write).

A harried traveler simply wolfs down a hamburger, not really worried or aware of its provenance or flavor.
And a bureaucrat buys whatever is cheapest and meets spec, without regard for how well it is designed or the supply chain that created it.
Enthusiasts will work their whole lives to be able to tell the difference in how an orchestra sounds, or how the chocolate is tempered or the simple elegance of thoughtful engineering.

Whining,"Toddlers whine. Most adults figure out how to lose the habit, because it’s toxic. And yet it persists.
Whining is a seductive package deal. When it works, it gets us attention, it lowers expectations, it gains sympathy and it forces people to identify with our pain. And it helps people feel as though they’re not responsible.
Often, the amount of whining is totally unrelated to the level of discomfort, and it seems to increase with how much privilege people perceive they deserve.
So why avoid it?
Because it changes our outlook on the world. When whining becomes a habit, we need to continue it, so we begin to interpret events as opportunities to prove that our whining is justified.
And because over time, people hate being around a whiner. The selfish desires of the habitual whiner eventually become clear. We realize that our shared reality is the world as it is, and that the whiner isn’t actually being singled out. And through practice, we learn that the best way to make things better is to work to improve them, not to demand special treatment. Reminding myself of the perils of whining is helpful indeed.

Not just easy-to-measure and profitable endeavors like sports betting or the stock market, but essential human interactions like, “what’s the best way to welcome a kindergarten student on the first day of school,” or “If we arrange the intersection this way, traffic will flow better.” In matters of public health and engineering, the ability to have a good idea about the repercussions of our work is urgent.
When dealing with a prognosticator, it’s worth asking three questions:
“What’s your track record?”It’s unlikely we’ll be right every single time, but once we adjust for luck and statistical anomalies, do you regularly outperform the others, or are you simply loud about it?
“Can you show your work?”It’s hard to trust someone who has a secret method. While this might be a competitive requirement, it’s more likely that the person has simply had a lucky streak (streaks are statistically likely).
“Have you taught your method to others?”This is a variation of the previous question. If people are using the method to successfully predict the future in other areas, then we’re seeing a resilient and robust approach to understanding how the world works.
Rules of thumb (the topic of my very first book, co-authored 34 years ago) are a stand in for the sort of rigor that is far more common today. With our predictions etched into the memory of the internet and more data available than ever before, we ought to be better at predicting what’s going to happen next and determining who’s good at that and who isn’t. But belief is a strong force, widely held, and sometimes it takes us a while to realize that confidence and volume are not a replacement for seeing things as they are and understanding how they work.","December 8, 2020","predicting, future, methodology"
On getting a fancy MBA…,"If I was admitted to a prestigious business school and scheduled to begin in January or even September, I’m pretty sure I’d defer.
Take a gap year, take two.
For many students, the two most important parts of the top-tier MBA are getting in and getting out. It’s about selection and certification.
For the last seventy years, the most famous graduate schools in business have been honing a particular model of teaching and value creation. They excel at a sometimes-magical sort of classroom experience, one that uses exclusivity and status and real-time high-stakes interaction to create an esprit de corps as well as occasional moments of real growth. And when the programs work, the $350,000 in tuition and opportunity cost for two years can be repaid with a fancy job that brings leverage and impact to the certified graduate.
The scarce degree is a signaling mechanism for a certain group of consultants and investment banks eager to hire people who have been filtered out and paid their dues as a way of showing commitment to a specific career.
It’s predicted that more people will apply this year than ever before. In uncertain times, the process feels reassuring. For most students, the elite MBA is about the prize at the end, not the learning or the experience.
Due to the pandemic, many of those in-person interactions moved online. And if the schools are honest about it, the interactions they offered online aren’t very good. Instead of the result of nearly a century of improvement, they’re often slapped together, and they’re filled with compromise. The people who built them weren’t charged with improving what was on offer on campus, they were supposed to come up with something that would either augment it or be a less-expensive and less-prestigious alternative for people who couldn’t participate in the ‘real’ program.
My alma mater was proud to have shifted online in a matter of weeks, but they certainly realize that if it didn’t have the fancy name on it, it wouldn’t have been worth much.
After a semester or even a full year of this, it’s quite possible you won’t have really gotten to know your peers, nor will you have learned much more than you could have from a close reading of twenty books.
And for many, that’s okay, because they’re paying for the certificate, not the learning. Iwroteabout this twenty years ago…
When I taught at the NYU graduate school of business, I was amazed. Not by the caliber of students, which was very high, but at how little emotional enrollment and intellectual curiosity many of them had in learning what was on offer. A few realized how much they could learn, but many of the students were simply concerned with what was on the test.
When I started thealtMBAfive years ago, I probably chose the wrong name for it. Because I didn’t set out to replace the business school. Instead, the goal has always been to use a new medium in a new way, to create a thirty-day experience that does what it doesbetterthan it could be done any other way.
As a filtering/certifying/sorting mechanism, the elite MBA remains a profitable path for the few people who end up at McKinsey and similar institutions. But most of us don’t have those jobs and don’t want to do that work. Instead, we have the opportunity to level up and figure out how to find more relevance and impact in the work we choose to do. We don’t need a certificate–instead, it’s about learning to see and exploring how to make an impact.
The altMBA and its parent, Akimbo, are now independently owned and run, a B Corp. committed to doing work that matters. But the mission hasn’t changed–to use this new medium in a productive way to help people level up. If you’ve been wondering, “is this all there is to work,” it might be a good time to check out thealtMBA. If you’re ready to lean into the process and the learning, without giving up your day job or focusing on scarcity, the altMBA could be a good fit.
No teachers, no gurus, no tests, no accreditation. Simply community in service of finding a better way forward.
The Early Decision admission deadline is tomorrow, Tuesday.
If you know someone in traditional education who is eager to push their medium forward, I hope you’ll point them to what they’re building atAkimbo. At 2% of the cost, it shouldn’t be better than what the famous schools are offering online, but I’m pretty certain that it is.
Education and learning are often very different. And online is not simply the same as sitting in a very big classroom but with a keyboard. It’s an entirely new form of pedagogy, one that’s about doing, not complying, about possibility, not coercion.
We have the chance to make things better. To learn and to lead. Together.","December 7, 2020","MBA, education, altMBA"
Trading trust for attention,"The old adage was always wrong. “Say whatever you like, but spell my name right.”
And now it’s even more of a trap.
The temptation to get the word out is overwhelming. There’s so much noise and so much hustle going on that we might believe that it’s okay to trade our standards and principles and position for some attention. At least for a minute or two.
The latest viral video is for an online dating site, and it features Satan as one of their customers. Nicely shot, sort of funny, with just the right amount of inside humor, there’s no arguing that it got attention.
But it burned trust. It established an image that contradicts the position they worked hard to earn for more than a decade.
There have always been shortcuts to attention. But the only purpose of advertising of any kind is to cause action, and action only happens when there’s trust involved.","December 6, 2020","trust, attention, advertising"
Treats,"The only way to train a group ofsea monkeysis by triggering an instinctual reaction.
The best way to train a dog is with tiny tasty treats, combined with calm and consistent feedback. Some dog owners resist this approach, because it doesn’t seem like the dog isreallyengaged or paying attention or learning anything if there’s too direct a connection between the actual treat and the action of the dog.
It’s tempting to resort to punishment instead, because it’s not only immediate, but for some trainers, it can relieve frustration and requires less patience. But punishment creates trauma.
Humans make up a lot of stories about what motivates us, but sooner or later, many of our stories involve feedback. We’re not sea monkeys, but we’re well aware of how the world around us treats us.
The most persistent changes in behavior happen when the story is so ingrained, we forget all about the feedback that reinforced it in the first place.
But it still started with the desire to be seen, to be treated with respect, to receive the dignity we each deserve. Ring a bell?","December 5, 2020","training, feedback, respect"
Insulation from the user experience,"When a small enterprise offers a lousy user experience, the person in charge learns about it, fast.
Customers leave, visitors bounce, complaints roll in. It’s expensive and it undermines the goals of the organization. Fortunately, in a small organization, the person with the ability to make change happen hears about it and can take action.
In a large organization, like my bank, the resources to make things better are dramatically bigger and largely underused.
That’s because the person who should take action has other priorities. Not only aren’t they exposed to the valuable feedback that frontline workers get (because the organization doesn’t reward ‘bad’ news), but they haven’t prioritized getting the user experience right.
It seems more important to please the boss, go to meetings and keep the numbers on track than it is to fix what might not feel broken.
Spend some time in the store.
Visit your own website to get work done the way a customer would.
Answer the tech phone calls for a few hours.
And figure out how to turn the user experience into a metric that’s as easy to measure as how much money you made last month.","December 4, 2020","User experience, organizational priorities, customer feedback"
Generalizations work (until they don’t),"Unlike natural phenomena like orbiting planets or geologic formations, there are no consistent and perfect laws of human behavior.
If we’re talking about groups of people, if we’re teaching, leading or trying to predict future behavior (all three are related) then we’re making a generalization.
And perhaps we don’t realize it, or aren’t clear that we are.
“In general, in many settings, most kindergarten kids have trouble getting through a long day without a nap.”
That’s not quite the same as, “all kids need a nap.”
Useful generalizations are essential to productive interventions and generous leadership.
Without generalizations, it’s almost impossible to begin to serve people.
And there lies the trap. If we stick with them too long, or insist that they are absolute, or fail to seek out the exceptions that all generalizations have, then we end up excluding or ignoring people who need to be seen. Which betrays all the work we set out to do.
We begin with a market or an audience, but we ultimately serve the individual.","December 3, 2020","Generalizations, Human Behavior, Leadership"
Understanding the automatic self,"How do you act when you’re not thinking about how you act? When no one is looking and when you’re just doing what you’re doing…
That’s the automatic self. No narrative, no second-guessing.
Now, here’s the real question:
Has your automatic self changed since you were a kid?
If it has (and I hope it has) then that’s all the proof we need that the automatic self isn’t a given, it’s not hard-wired and it’s not permanent.
In fact, it changes from practice. It’s a skill.
We can learn to be the ‘authentic’ version of ourselves that we’d like to live with.
It takes habits, learning and feedback. And the commitment to become a better version of ourselves.","December 2, 2020","automatic self, authenticity, personal growth"
Shopping is not the same as buying,"Just about everyone over the age of fifteen, anywhere in the world, engages in the market in some way. We need things and we buy them.
That’s not what shopping is.
Shopping is the act of imagining what you might want. It’s the thrilling but risky exchange of money for something that you’ve never purchased before. Something that might be better than you hope, but it might not.
In some communities, shopping is so foreign and risky that it simply doesn’t happen.
Shopping is a cultural activity, with styles and approaches varying depending on who you are and where you live.
Shopping releases chemicals in our brain. In many cases, particularly with luxury goods, it’s this emotional shift that we’re actually paying for, not the thing we’re buying.
The trillion-dollar industries that are based on shopping as a sport (as distinguished from buying what we need) are relatively new, but have been around long enough that many of us take them for granted–normal activities that appear to have always been around.
Money is a story. Your story is probably different from everyone else’s. Our relationship with debt, savings and earning money is extraordinarily complex. Consumer credit has turned from a convenience and useful bridge into, for many people, a trap.
Gift cards, garage sales and self-storage units start to reveal just how many layers we’ve built up around our commitment to shopping.
In small doses, for many people, shopping can produce happiness. But it doesn’t usually scale.
More stuff might not be the substitute for the things that we truly want.","December 1, 2020","Shopping, Consumer Behavior, Emotional Spending"
The stuff in the margins,"Do you have to use all the time in the brainstorming session? Fill in the entire page of your creativity notebook?

Belief and knowledge,"They’re different.
Knowledge changes all the time. When we engage with the world, when we encounter data or new experiences, our knowledge changes.
But belief is what we call the things that stick around, particularly and especially in the face of changes in knowledge.
While more knowledge can change belief, it usually doesn’t. Belief is a cultural phenomenon, created in conjunction with the people around us.
The easy way to discern the two: “What would you need to see or learn to change your mind about that?”","January 30, 2021","Belief, Knowledge, Change"
Panes of glass,"We have windowpanes because glass used to be really expensive. Panes allowed us to use smaller sheets, with the added bonus that if one broke, you could simply replace part of the window.
Today, big sheets of glass are much cheaper, and many windows feature fake panes of glass–a process that uses one big sheet with moldings crisscrossed over it. Of course, this actually costs more to create than a simple window would. We’re overpaying to reproduce the effect that we originally put into place to save money.
If you look around, you’ll realize that we make choices like this all the time when new technologies arise. Cruft is a comfort.","January 29, 2021","windowpanes, glass, technology"
The coordinators,"Fashion is everywhere.
It’s not simply the clothes you chose to wear today  (and the ones that haven’t seen the outside of your closet for years).
It’s the music that you’re loving right now, songs you wouldn’t have tuned into ten years ago.
It’s the way we understand how the world works, which policies make sense to us and what sort of food we eat. Even the investments we make or the debts we incur.
It’s the rhythm of our days, our priority list and our urgencies as well.
Almost none of our choices in the world are the result of independent direct experience. Instead, we make them in the context of culture, of our surroundings, of ‘people like us do things like this.’ We choose to align with a segment of the culture and take our cues from them.
Sometimes, there’s a coordinator.
Forty years ago, fewer than 100 people determined what songs were going to be the popular ones, the ones that ‘everyone’ would be listening to next week. And a consortium of industry titans decides what colors are going to show up in appliances a few years from now.
We might want to believe that culture simply happens, that it’s organic, distributed and based on millions of independent decisions. And sometimes it is. But more often, there’s an instigator and a benefit for someone along the way.
While many fashion systems are more open and permeable than before (there aren’t three TV networks, there are a million YouTube channels) there are still gatekeepers and narrative setters.
How does the coordinator decide? Are they working in your best interests? Are they erratic, self-deceiving, elusive, selfish, or perhaps a long-term thinker? Do they have a bias toward reality and resilience or is it simply a hustle?
In Latin, the expression isCui Bono. Who benefits? If it’s you, if it’s us, then fashion is working for us. On the other hand, if it leads to negative outcomes, disappointment and disconnection, it’s worth asking if it’s something we want to keep doing, even (especially) if it feels right in the moment. Because everything we do feels right in the moment.
It’s not a secret conspiracy and it is a choice. Who decides today what’s going to be important tomorrow?","January 28, 2021","fashion, culture, coordination"
Asking for the second favor,"The first favor is when you ask a friend or colleague to do something for you.

Useful redundancy,"There’s a section in the greeting card store for “New Baby” cards. I’m not sure what other kinds of babies are available. But the ‘new’ reminds us of why we are sending the card.
And “Happy Birthday” goes without saying as well. The person knows it’s their birthday, and of course you want it to be a happy one, that’s why you sent a card. While a blank on the front of the card would probably have just as much information value, saying it more often than is necessary is precisely the point of the card.
Sometimes, we assume that the person we’re engaging with knows exactly what we mean and want to express. But that assumption is often wrong, and a little redundancy can go a long way.

Famous conductors,"Here’s a useful metaphor:
Famous conductors are often judged for an hour or two on stage. They wear expensive clothes, make dramatic gestures and receive ovations. They also get paid a lot to carry a very little stick and they’re the only one on stage who doesn’t make noise.
But it turns out that none of these things are what makes a great conductor.

These were not pings for me, not on my phone. They weren’t sounds that my phone even makes.
It doesn’t matter.

It’s probably not breathtaking in scope.
It’s probably not immediately popular.

And we can decide to take responsibility.

The trap of busy,"Everyone who wants to be busy is busy.
But not everyone is productive.
Busy is simply a series of choices about how to spend the next minute.
Productive requires skill, persistence and good judgment. Productive means that you have created something of value.
Perhaps your self-created busy-ness is causing you to be less productive.","January 21, 2021","busy, productive, choices"
Tolerance,"It means two things:
In high-quality manufacturing, producing to tolerance means that all the parts are as identical as possible. Getting the tolerances precise permits cars to be made more reliably, and for production to run more effectively.
In human beings, tolerance creates resilience. Tolerance of different abilities and preferences makes it easy to work with diversity of thought and approach and expertise, enabling better outcomes.
Tolerance doesn’t mean permitting behavior that undermines the community. In fact, it requires that we put the community first. Instead, it’s a willingness to focus on contribution instead of compliance.
We need to choose wisely. Are we working with machined parts or with people?","January 20, 2021","Tolerance, Diversity, Community"
Arguments and outcomes,"The purpose of marketing is to cause change. If we’re trying to build a movement, raise money for a non-profit, sell a product, change lifestyles, build community–these are all marketing activities that exist to change the way people act.
The project usually begins with clarity. The cause is just, the harm is real, the product is better. The work is worth doing, there’s an urgent need for change, it’s real.
But sometimes, the original arguments, as valid as they are, don’t work. In fact, they rarely do. People don’t all line up to donate or work out or sign up from the very start. You can put in the energy to have your pitch get heard, but the early ones often fall flat. It’s only as the arguments become more clear, or change, that they begin to resonate.
And yet we can get stuck with a certain orthodoxy. An early argument can become the only argument. The story that the group tells from the start is therightone, and anything else is a disappointing compromise, even if it leads to the action you sought in the first place.
In general, there are three things that cause people to change their actions:
Status roles involve whether this action will move someone up or down in the estimation of their peers or competitors.
Affiliation is related to status, but more specific. It’s “people like us do things like this.” In the words of the Rolling Stones: He can’t be a man because he doesn’t smoke, the same cigarettes as me.
And convenience is the hallmark of a semi-lazy decision–it’s just easier.
Using these three drivers, you can look at the spread of helmets in the NHL, or electric cars in California or Nike sneakers everywhere. We can see it in the decline in smoking in some communities, or the rise of a popular style of music as well.
The originators of these and other ideas didn’t begin with status, affiliation or convenience, but that’s what ended up working.","January 19, 2021","marketing, behavior change, social influence"
Three types of kindness,"There is the kindness of ‘please’ and ‘thank you.’ And the kindness of “I was wrong, I’m sorry.” The small kindnesses that smooth our interactions and help other people feel as though you’re aware of them. These don’t cost us much, in fact, in most settings, engaging with kindness is an essential part of connection, engagement and forward motion.
And then there is the kindness of dignity. Of giving someone the benefit of the doubt. The kindness of seeing someone for the person that they are and can become, and the realization that everyone, including me and you, has a noise in our heads, a story to be told, fear to be danced with and dreams to be realized.
And there’s another: The kindness of not seeking to maximize short-term personal gain. The kindness of building something for the community, of doing work that matters, of finding a resilient, anti-selfish path forward.
Kindness isn’t always easy or obvious, because the urgent race to the bottom, to easily measured metrics and to scarcity, can distract us. But bending the arc toward justice, toward dignity and toward connection is our best way forward.
Kindness multiplies and it enables possiblity. When we’re of service to people, we have the chance to make things better.

Pleasing the unpleasable,"There are bosses, customers and partners who will never be happy.
And sometimes, despite the futility, we work to please them anyway.
Because that can be a compass. It can help us do the work that will satisfy others (or ourselves).
It can also be a trap, an endless treadmill of disappointment that leads nowhere in particular.
We should be clear about which one we’re on. Because working to please the pleasable is a lot more likely to pay off.","January 17, 2021","pleasing, satisfaction, futility"
Is mood a gift or a skill?,"Some days, we wake up with optimism and possibility… we’re able to find more reserves, connect better and do more generous work.
That might be because the outside world has handed us good news and opportunities, or it might be because the chemicals in our brain are particularly aligned…
I think it’s fair to assert that sometimes, our moods are handed to us.
But it’s also clearly true that we can do things to improve our mood. Morning pages, meditation, exercise, positive thinking, the right audio inputs, who we hang out with, the media we consume–it’s all a choice.
And if it’s a choice, that means it’s a skill, because we can get better at it.","January 16, 2021","mood, skill, positivity"
The difficult choice of disappointment,"All forward motion disappoints someone.
If you serve one audience, you’ve let another down. One focus means that something else got ignored. If you create something scarce, someone won’t get their hands on it.
The very act of creation means that it won’t be the ideal solution for everyone.
On the other hand, with certainty, we know that doing nothing disappoints an even larger group of people.
The opportunity is to find someone to delight and to embrace the fact that someone is not everyone.","January 15, 2021","disappointment, audience, creation"
Born to run (things),"The first half of Bruce Springsteen’s autobiography makes some things abundantly clear:
He had no natural ability to play the guitar. In fact, after his first lessons, he quit, unable to play a note.
He had no singing talent. Every group he was part of needed a lead singer, and it wasn’t him.
And just about everyone dismissed him. Audiences walked out, his first agent simply stopped returning his calls and bandmates gave up and moved on.
He didn’t even know how to drive a car. Not only wasn’t he dating in high school, he wasn’t even cruising around town, being a charismatic rock star.
Talent is overrated. Skill is acquirable.
Showing up is something almost every creative leader has in common. In business, in the arts, in society. Consistently shipping the work, despite the world’s reaction, despite the nascent nature of our skill, despite the doubts.
And community is essential. The people you surround yourself with can reinforce your story, raise the bar and egg you on.
After the fact, the community becomes an integral part of your story of success. But first, you have to commit to the journey.

Burn out, on the other hand, is often caused by trying to control things that we can’t possibly control. As a result, we waste cycles and create a pattern of stress.

Understanding “popular”,"Popular doesn’t mean better by any absolute scale.
Popular simply means that more people likethisthing thanthatthing.
Popular isn’t an act of genius. Popular is either an intentional act (to serve a particularly large, homogenous audience) or a lucky break.
The most direct way to become popular is to serve the audience that made the last thing popular. By that definition, popular almost always means ‘not better.’ It simply means that you found a large group and gave them what they wanted.

Natural technique doesn’t exist,"It’s amazing how much we can get done simply by trying.
Whether it’s writing or golf or sales, when we show up and do our best, we can make things happen.
But then, our internal horsepower becomes insufficient. As we seek to make a bigger impact, we discover that powering our way through obstacles is simply too difficult.
And so we need to learn technique.
Technique is the unnatural approach to a problem that, with practice, becomes second-nature. Technique is the non-obvious solution that amateurs and hard-working beginners rarely stumble upon on their own.
The commitment to a practice opens the door to finding a more useful technique.
You got this far because your natural approach was helpful. But to get to the next level, you’ll need technique, which, by definition, isn’t something you come by on your own.
If there are people who are playing at a different level than you who are embracing an approach that feels unnatural to you, you may have found the technique that you’ve been missing.","January 10, 2021","technique, practice, improvement"

Why isn’t there a line at the library?,"If any other institution was giving away essential items, it would be a sensation. The grocery store, the car dealership, even the laundromat would have a line out the door.
And now that we’ve moved many elements of the library online, it’s even easier to access.
A century ago, information was truly scarce and books were far more expensive than they are now. A decade ago, obtaining the instructions on how to do something was difficult indeed.
“It’s too expensive,” or “I can’t get access to it,” used to be really good excuses. But they obscured the truth: “It’s too much work.”
And that’s the answer to the question. It’s too much work to change our minds. It’s too much work to dance with the fear of failure. It’s too much work to imagine walking through the world differently.
That doesn’t have to be the case. We can refuse to be brainwashed into accepting the status quo, and we can commit to finding the others, engaging with them and leveling up.

The tumblehome,"Chestnut brand canoes dominated the Canadian wilderness for years. One reason is that they were shaped with a tumblehome. If you leaned the boat over, the boat leaned back, providing stability. The more you leaned, the harder the boat worked to stay upright.
This is the resilience that leads to stability, not brittleness. It is the hallmark of a system that is aware of the forces on it and responds with just enough to keep things steady over time.
Tumblehome provides support, but it also requires ongoing effort, care and focus to keep a system functioning. The tumblehome doesn’t take care of itself.
Every existing system persists because it has a sort of tumblehome. And if you want to understand a system, it helps to see where the tumblehome lies.","January 7, 2021","tumblehome, resilience, stability"
Mode switching,"What’s the point of sorting the silverware when you empty the dishwasher–why not simply put all of it in the drawer in a random order, and then pick out the cutlery you need when you need it? It’s the same amount of sorting, after all.
We intuitively understand the reason. If you take a minute to sort the forks, knives and spoons all at once, you won’t have to spend ten seconds every single time you want to find a fork.
The cost of changing gears is higher than we give it credit for. The web has persuaded us thateverything is miscellaneous,that sorting things carefully and keeping them where they belong is a waste of time–because we can simply find them when we need them.
But switching to ‘find mode’ breaks our rhythm and eliminates the useful serendipity that happens when the right things are near each other, right where we expect them to be.","January 6, 2021","mode switching, organization, efficiency"
Pain is real,"And it is unevenly distributed.
The only way we have to understand someone else’s pain is to consider it in comparison to our own experiences. It’s a bit like our taste buds: If something is described as chocolatey, but you’ve never tasted chocolate, you have no clue what they’re describing.
It’s easy, then, to dismiss the pain that others report, physical or emotional, if it differs from our experience.
Even if you’ve never felt this particular pain, the other person is feeling it, right now. Perhaps you’ve felt the pain before and don’t think it’s that bad–your customer’s experience might be different.
You might have been insulated from fear or the trauma that has magnified the experience for the person you’re engaging with.
Even if the circumstances wouldn’t have caused you to feel this particular pain, that might not be true for your friend. And even if you can’t imagine the feeling, it’s still real for them.
Pain ignored is still pain. And pain acknowledged is a first step toward easing that pain.","January 5, 2021","pain, empathy, experience"
The ruts,"It’s not an accident that dirt roads end up with deep ruts on them, that moguls on hills get steeper and that we find ourselves slipping back into the very things that exhaust us at work.
Once the pattern starts to be grooved, we repeat it, which only makes the groove ever deeper.
Habits are habits because in many ways, they’re simply easier in the moment.
A significant challenge in learning (as distinct from certified ‘education’) is that learning requires us to break old habits and walk away from old ruts. It rewires our instincts and helps us see the world in a new way–not just see it, but act differently in it.
It’s incredibly difficult to lever yourself out of a long-term rut. A community and a curriculum can make a huge difference.
That’s why I created the altMBA five years ago. It wasn’t designed to be a knowledge-delivery tool (the internet does that just fine, all the time, for free). It’s designed to be a habit-breaking, habit-forming, rut-reducing tool.
And the best way to break a habit is to model and then commit to a new habit.
Tomorrow’s the regular deadline to apply for the next session of thealtMBA. If you’re ready to leave your rut behind, I hope you’ll consider it.

Infrastructure,"If you want to see wisdom and maturity in action, look for someone (or a community) investing in infrastructure before it’s too late.
Part of what makes my part of the country so lovely is that the trains work, the water is clean and the health department inspects restaurants.
But for the last fifty years, around the world, few communities have invested enough to maintain the systems they were smart enough to build. Now, my block loses power for days at a time after a storm… And it’s far more dire elsewhere.
In our personal lives, we can coast on a particular credential or bit of knowledge for years. And then one day, we realize we’re obsolete. The idea is the same:
We need to plant our trees before we want the shade, and fix our systems before they break.","January 3, 2021","Infrastructure, investment, sustainability"
2030,"I just installed newsmoke detectorsin the house (definitely worth the hassle and low expense) and the batteries now last ten years.
There’s a little spot on the side of the detector to write the year you installed it.
I’m wondering what the person (maybe me) who changes the batteries a decade from now will think when they see “2020” written on the side.
Whatever happens over the next ten years, if history is any guide at all, the year we just finished will be mostly a faded memory.
What will matter more than what just happened is what we decide to do with where we are, daily, persistently, generously, for the next 3,650 days.

A simple 2 x 2 for choices,"Our life is filled with projects. We invest time, effort or money, and perhaps we get a result.
It’s useful to have a portfolio of projects, because not all of them are going to work.
The 2 x 2 grid looks like this:
It might be simple, but it’s not always easy. Success doesn’t always mean money, it just means that you got what you were hoping for. And while every project fits into one of the four quadrants, there’s no right answer for any given person or any given moment..
Here are some of the traps that are worth avoiding:
On the other hand, consider a portfolio of projects. Some of them have a very high likelihood of working out, and each one of these outcomes is pleasant, if not game-changing. Play often enough, though, and your persistent generosity will pay off.
And then, mix into that some of the moonshot projects that most people are afraid to take on. They’re afraid because they have equated “low chance of success” with “risky.” They’re not the same. Risky implies that failure will cost a lot. It won’t. You can thrive with this strategy because you have a portfolio, and because you realize that “unlikely” is not the same as “not worth trying.”
The best portfolios are persistent (because patience is a rare skill), they’re generous (so others root for you to succeed) and they build on each other (because then, even the ones that don’t work increase your chances for the next one to work out).

Tilting at windmills,"The windmills aren’t the problem, it’s the tilting.
In Cervantes’ day, ’tilting’ was a word for jousting. You tilted your lance at an enemy and attacked.
Don Quijote was noted for believing that the windmills in the distance were giants, and he spent his days on attack.
Change can look like a windmill.
When we say, “the transition to a new place is making me uncomfortable,” we’ve expressed something truthful. But when we attack a windmill, we’ve wasted our time and missed an opportunity to focus on what matters instead.
When my dad taught at the University of Buffalo, the heart of his MBA classes was teaching about the ‘change agent’. This is the external force that puts change into motion. The change agent, once identified, gives us an understanding of our options and the need to respond, not to react.

Grievance and possibility,"We might be settling scores or we might be opening doors. It’s up to us.
Grievance and possibility have confusing roots.
Grievanceisn’t about grieving. In fact, it’s the opposite. Grievance is the narrative of getting even.
Possibilitydoesn’t itemize everything that’s possible. Instead, it focuses on the side effects that come from acting as though things are possible.
Grievance looks back and possibility looks forward.
Organizations and relationships that are focused on grievance care a lot about their share. About the competition. About maintaining ‘enough’.
Organizations that are focused on possibility care a lot about how big the pie is. About innovation. And about what’s next.
You can build a relationship or a career on grievance or on possibility.
And you can run a justice/penal system that way as well.
Possibility begets more possibility. Opportunities multiply.
And, alas, grievance leads to more grievance. Because it’s the fuel that keeps the narrative going.
Organizations/partnerships/systems that are usefully focused on possibility don’t deny that there are reasons for grievance, that there have been actions and omissions that must be addressed. In fact, they adopt a posture of forward motion as the best way to address the problems that came before.
One challenge is embracing the effective and generative approach of possibility when we’re sure that we’re entitled to grievance.

Ranking the unrankable,"Weight is a useful measure. 10 pounds is twice as much as 5 pounds.
Measuring things and then ranking them effectively enables us to make better choices and to scale up our operations.
Sometimes, though, in our rush to standardize and process a complicated world, we begin to measure things that can’t be easily measured, and then, since we’ve measured them, to aggressively rank them.
Smartisn’t easily measurable. Neither isbeautiful,goodorsuccessful. And especiallyhappy.
A high SAT score is a measure of whether or not you scored well on the SAT. That’s it. A bank balance is a measure of how much money you have in the bank. That’s all.
In the face of the difficulty the system has in measuring things that don’t measure, we create proxies. Things like popularity as a proxy for whether a work of human creativity has worth or not.
It’s a method built to process commodities instead of people, and it’s running amok.
A precision ranking is nothing but a number, an inaccurate and ultimately useless stand-in. These proxies are created and spread and relied upon by a system that craves certainty and order.
Realizing the fraud of the proxies might help us get back to what matters instead.","February 24, 2021","Measuring, Proxies, Value"
The reverse value/luxury curve,"For most products and services, we rate them on a curve.
Of course the seat on the discount airline was cramped, but that’s okay because it was cheap.
Of course this Camry doesn’t look or ride like a Porsche, don’t be stupid…
But, the opposite is true in the high end. When luxury goods are compared to luxury goods, the narrative is, “this one must be better, in absolute and relative terms, preciselybecauseit’s more expensive.”
And so hiring McKinsey costs 10x more than hiring a former McKinsey consultant. And so it’s worth more.
And so $150,000 elephant-sized stereo speakers (yes, they exist) are far better than $5,000 speakers (can’t you see?)
This goes beyond the standard understanding of aVeblengood. Because in addition to being more expensive, these super-luxury goods areless effective, harder to use and generally a pain in the neck.That’s part of their appeal.

The end of dumb pipes,"The phone company didn’t care what sort of conversation you were having. The call was the call. Same is true for cable–what you watched didn’t matter to them.
The reason retail banks are so frustrating to many customers is that because they began with a geographic focus, they’re dumb about who their customers are. They underserve or overserve in random ways. And in trying to serve everyone, they end up doing a lousy job of serving anyone.
But there’s no longer a reason for a provider to be dumb. They can optimize for you and your needs. They know what you’ve done and they should be able to guess what you might want next. Not to do thistoyou, but with you and for you.

Algorithms give or they take,"If there’s scarcity, we need to make choices.
Who gets hired, what website shows up at the top of the search results, who gets a loan.
And while we can make those choices on a case by case basis, at scale, we rely on algorithms instead. A series of coded steps, inferences and decision-making heuristics that ostensibly get better as they gather more data.
At this point, it’s clear that algorithms are remaking our culture. They drive how social media networks surface content, how search engines highlight websites, how AI makes decisions about who flies or doesn’t, who gets a loan or doesn’t, it’s everywhere, all the time.
And algorithms are not neutral. They can’t be. Every decision has consequences, and unlike the pythagorean theorem, there isn’t a right answer, simply a choice about now or later, all along a spectrum.
An algorithmtakeswhen it finds a selfish or defective element of society and magnifies it for short-term profit. It finds habits or instincts that individuals might have and exploits them to do something that benefits the algorithm-maker without leaving the culture or the user better off in the long run.
And an algorithmgiveswhen it amplifies the better angels of our nature, when it helps us do the things we’d like to do in the long run, for us and the people we care about.
A challenge for anyone programming at a monopoly, a public company, a well-funded startup or even a non-profit in search of donors is this: Do you have the guts to build an algorithm you can be proud of even if it doesn’t pay off as well in the short run?
Because if the answer is no, blaming the system isn’t going to help anyone. You are the system, we all are, and given the power of invisible and leveraged algorithms, it’s essential that they be created and maintained by people who understand that they’re responsible for the impact they make.

Things like ripe avocados and morel mushrooms are terrific to have in abundance. By definition, though, abundant caution is not only more than we need, it’s more than is helpful. Because we get hooked on the feeling.
We can always make a risk ever smaller. But the cost is that we will increase other risks.
Please don’t avoid appropriate caution. It matters to you and to the community. But seeking reassurance and peace of mind by trying to drive risk to zero doesn’t get you either one of them.

"Publishers, curation and algorithms","Publishers take two risks to bring new ideas to the world.
(And I’m talking about any middleperson–a gallerist, a TV network, a movie studio, a label–they’re all publishers).
One risk is the time and money spent attracting and supporting the creator/artist.
And the other risk is curatorial. They are risking the trust and attention of the audience by choosing THIS instead of THAT. If they develop a reputation for having good taste (in however the audience defines that) they earn more attention and trust and the benefit of the doubt.
The great publishers might not be famous (Motown was, andThe New Yorkeris) but they change the culture.
TED takes a risk when they put someone on the main stage or feature a video online. And a podcaster takes a risk when they choose a guest.
The artist gets two benefits. They get the benefit of being picked: cash, editing, the emotional solace of being selected and supported.
And they get the benefit of curation. They reach a scarce audience with help from an organization that’s good at that, and is willing to risk theirpermissionasset to support the artist’s work.
The internet has pockets where all of this is intentionally undermined, often by organizations that adopt the mantle of publisher when it’s convenient.
The Long Tailis Chris Anderson’s term for a library with infinite shelf space, one where the rules of scarcity don’t apply in the same way. The internet platform doesn’t care how many different titles they carry, and in fact, benefits from carrying all of them. Spotify and YouTube and Amazon don’t actually care what you listen to or watch, as long as you come back tomorrow.
Because they have nothing much at stake when it comes to content, and because they are focused on scale, they defer to an algorithm. It’s the mysterious program, by now so complex that no one knows exactly how it works, that decides what works get attention. Even the people who work there guess at what the algorithm wants.
And this has consequences.
Look up a recipe online. It’s a very different experience than finding a recipe in your favorite cookbook. The recipes online offer nearly infinite variety, but they’re largely untested, and they’re formatted in a time-wasting upside-down sort of way because someone decoded that this is what Google’s algorithm would like.
Look at most of the junk in the app store, or most of the content in social media. The algorithm sorts through everything, and when anything can make a buck, anything will.
Of course, there are enormous benefits to the long tail. It gives creators who don’t match an existing editorial paradigm a chance to be heard. It gives readers/listeners/watchers a chance to discover things that would have been unpublished in the old model. And it creates room for discussion and access where it might not have existed.
But…
Publishing to an algorithm is not the same as publishing to an audience. If the creator has no publisher and no permission asset, then being heard is dramatically more difficult. As is getting paid.
And living in a culture that’s driven by profit-seeking algorithm owners is different as well. Because without curation, who is responsible? Who is guiding the culture? Who pushes the boundaries or raises the standards?
Wikipedia has 5,000 curators who work overtime to keep the site from becoming yet another example of Godwin’s Law. Sites that only obey the Long Tail and the primacy of the algorithm have fewer standards. They view curation as a last resort, and if mass is the standard, then mass is all that will be rewarded.
It’s tempting to hope that there’s a hybrid out there. But for that to exist, the algorithms have to work for creators and publishers, not the other way around. The publishers have to embrace the cost of curation, focusing on what they want to promote and paying the price to do so, owning the upside and downside of that intervention.
Culture is almost always improved not by what the masses want tomorrow, but by what a small and dedicated group of people are willing to commit to for the long run. “People like us do things like this” is the recipe for culture.
Creators: It’s possible (perhaps required) to not wait to get picked by a traditional publisher. At the same time, we benefit when we realize that the algorithm isn’t rooting for us and quite probably is working against us. The only winning approach is to earn permission and a direct connection with our fans and then act as curators for ideas (and as our own publishers).
Platforms: It helps to acknowledge that you’re not actually a publisher, that ceding decisions to the crowd and the algorithm and walking away from curation might make you a landlord, but you’re not incrementally improving the culture. Yes, it’s possible to find a middle ground, as Netflix has, but it requires awareness, persistence and discipline.

Find out all the details here.
The short version:
In March 2021, on myFacebook,LinkedInandInstagrampages, I’ll be posting live interviews and tastings with some of the greatest chocolate makers of our time. And you can pre-order the bars and taste along if you like. If you’ve got chocolate in hand, feel free to join in with comments or live feedback as we go.
Dark chocolate, made by hand, by artisans who start with the bean and take it all the way to the finished product–it’s special. There are tones and notes and flavors that you can learn to taste. It’s fun to share. It’s an affordable luxury–you can buy the equivalent of a $500 bottle of wine in chocolate form for $11 or so. You can even get snobby and talk about trinitario and porcelana beans…
And the people who grow the beans, the farmers, are some of the poorest people in the world, often at the mercy of a heartless industrial food chain. The bars we’ll be tasting are all from producers who pay their farmers significantly more than the clearing price. If we can spread the word about this craft, they’ll all do better.

Avoid the clown suit,"How to get better at graphic design…
There are more amateur and semi-pro graphic designers working today than at any point in human history.
Presentations, instagram posts, websites, the cover of your kindle book or the logo for your podcast–anyone who’s touching a phone or a computer is called upon to do design, and most of us could get better.
Understand the difference:Simply throwing type or a picture up will definitely put the information in front of people, but it won’t carry with it all of the care, insight and professionalism you want and need.
We don’t tolerate typos in commercial products, and the market has the same feeling about design that’s lazy or out of place.
Graphic design represents an emotional commitment to the work. Long before we read the words or understand the images, we see the layout. Kerning and color and weight and form arrive in our brains before we have decided what the words on the page actually mean. You wouldn’t wear a clown suit to a job interview, and yet people dress up their ideas in clown suits all the time.
Getting better:If you are sure that you’re already good enough and that feedback is simply annoying, you’re probably not reading this. For the rest of us, there’s the chance to say, “I’m going to move to a higher level, and that means leaving this level behind.” Don’t defend your work with the generous critic. The entire point of getting better is to eagerly abandon the approaches you were taking on your way to gaining new skills that are more effective.
The picture in your head:This is a huge step. If what you’re designing looks right to you, then it’s never going to improve. The leap here is to go shopping. Find ten websites that succeed by whatever measure matters to you. Go to a bookstore and find ten book covers that represent the level of authority and professionalism you seek. Go to theDielineand compare 40 package designs. Check out the difference between the photos you’re taking and the ones that are on the most successful online retail sites. Find some heroes. Understand the genre you’re working in.
Make the picture real:And now–copy them. Step by step, learn what you need to learn to make something as good as your heroes. A direct copy is not what you’re going to publish, but at least you’ll understand how to add the level of care and signalling and understanding of genre that’s needed to get the emotional element of your point across.

Living on the delta,"“What’s different?”

It’s not easy to focus on the chronic. In fact, it’s really difficult. Too often we are in organizations that are highly leveraged, living from quarter to quarter, or we’re depending on clients or bosses from day to day. Too often, we don’t have enough in reserve to focus on anything but what’s changing or what’s getting the spotlight.
It’s the chronic issues that end up causing the most pain. Systems at work that never get better, or problems that fester.
For too long, there have been lousy schools, inequitable opportunity and the pain of grinding poverty. There have always been innocent people in prison and unheard voices in need of our help. There has long been graft and inefficiency and the tragedy of preventable illness and discomfort.
But we’ve too often turned away from those issues, from the things we’re accustomed to, because they appear to be the same as they were. The status quo is there because we’ve accepted it. We might have worked hard on some of the issues, but it seems impossible to be on our toes about all of them, all of the time.
And marketers have pushed us to focus on the new movie, the new crisis, the new tech…
When sudden change hits, it’s easy to get focused on it to the exclusion of everything else. It’s the delta, the change, the acceleration–it attracts our gaze. And we can’t turn away, or it feels like we can’t.
The media is in the delta business. That’s all they do, that’s what they get paid for, and they work to maximize our addiction to it.
Not everyone is lucky enough to be able to spend time away from the delta, but if you can, it’s worth the effort.
,The problem with living on the delta is that as we strap into a rollercoaster of external change, we forget to work on the problems we have the opportunity to improve.","February 10, 2021","chronic issues, status quo, external change"
The last thing and the first thing,"The new ritual, even more than checking the windows and doors before bed, is to check the incoming. Doom scroll a bit, check Slack and email and make sure there are no loose ends.
And then the ritual continues, first thing in the morning as we check the overnights, to make sure everything is still okay.
What if, instead, just for a week, the last thing we did was make a list of exciting opportunities for the future? And if the first thing after waking up was doing some morning pages and jotting down what we’re looking forward to?

The surprising problem with ranked-choice voting,"By every measure I can think of, ranked-choice voting is a superior way to hold a modern election. When a group of people want to decide something at the national or even the organizational level, having everyone rank their options is a net positive.
The mechanics are much easier in an age of computers. If one option comes out ahead among the majority, you’re done. If not, throw out the least favorite outcome and recount, using the second choice of people who had voted for the eliminated candidate. Continue the process of elimination and recounting until you have a candidate that is the most acceptable to the most people.
This process tends to reward candidates who are less divisive and more willing to listen to multiple points of view. It also leads to an outcome that is easier for more people to live with.
The surprising thing? In a recent primary in New York, some people had trouble with the new method. It’s not that the method of voting is particularly difficult. The problem is that we’ve trained ourselves to be RIGHT. To have “our candidate” and not be open (or pushed) to even consider that there might be an alternative. And to feel stress when we need to do the hard work of ranking possible outcomes, because that involves, in advance, considering acceptable outcomes that while not our favorite, would be acceptable.
This is hard work that’s worth doing.
And we don’t have to wait for a public election to do it. It’s a fine way to organize our choices not only in small groups, but on our own.",,"ranked-choice voting, election process, decision-making"
Taking action,"Once we decide to make a difference, it’s easy for doubt to set in. Because making a difference causes change, and change is scary. One way through the fear is with community. Groups of people who not only have your back, but are on a similar journey.

The Bootstrapper’s Workshopis back for its fifth session. It’s about a specific sort of business, beyond freelancing, where you build a business bigger than yourself without raising money from a bank or an investor. I’ve done this and it’s thrilling.It opens for sign ups today, February 8.
ThealtMBAreturns, with more than 5,000 alumni around the world, this is the flagship at Akimbo. More than a third of all students are reimbursed by their employers, because organizations are discovering how effective it is. The Regular Decision Deadline is tomorrow.
The Real Skills Conferenceis also back for its fourth session. It’s open for signups now, and it takes place for two hours on February 19th. A conference without speakers or snacks, it’s about connection and possibility.Check out the details here.
And the indefatigable Ramon Ray back with his extraordinary workshop for people who arebuilding a small business. Not a big business that’s still small, but a business that’s betterbecauseit’s small, it’s personal and it works. His joy is contagious and you’ll find people and ideas that will help you regardless of what stage your company is in.Enrollment opens on the 23rd, but you can sign up for more information today.

Toward nimble,"Is ‘nimble’ a good thing? Should we seek to be flexible, resilient and quick to be able to shift and adapt?
Because often, it seems as though we work to create an environment where it’s difficult indeed to be nimble. We buy expensive assets, lock into long-term systems and fail to ignore sunk costs. We set foundations in concrete instead of using a lightweight tent…
In consistent times, there’s leverage to be found in investing in the status quo. But when we’re unsure about where the next shift is going to come from, perhaps investing in flexibility makes a bit more sense.",,"nimble, flexibility, adaptation"
Blaming the user,"In the early days of tech, the acronym of choice was, “Read the friggin manual.” If an engineer uttered RTFM in your direction, it meant that whatever happened was your fault. Tech is a powerful tool, and if you want to use it, do the work.
Over time, as user interface became user experience, and as organizations sought to serve ever larger audiences, UX designers began to take responsibility for how people would engage with their websites and software.
For a while, if the software didn’t work for the intended user, that was the software’s fault. “We’ll make a better interface” is a much better motto because it puts the responsibility where it belongs.
But the overhang was still there. In many companies, “user error” was a problem for the user to fix. Organizations were pitching convenience and simplicity, but the moment the user made an error, the messages were curt, the wait on hold was long due to unusually heavy call volume, and if it didn’t work for you, well, we’ve got enough users, it’s cheaper for you to go somewhere else.
As my colleagueMark Hurstpoints out, this contempt for the clueless user has been multiplied dramatically by the stock market. Now, many large companies have decided to use UX against their users, all of their users, by turning our experience with their websites and networks into one that serves their needs, not ours. It feels more convenient in the short run, perhaps even fun, but it’s designed to create lock-in, a permanent network effect and, as soon as practicable, a persistent source of cash flow.
In the latest crop of apps, the heavy-handed push toward compliance is truly obvious, from the very first interaction. And in the ones that are already dominant, the veneer of customer focus is fading fast.
If you’re not paying, you’re the product, not the customer. And sometimes, even if you are paying, the long-term impact of your quest for convenience might not be what you were hoping for.
The long-term consequences of our network choices are long indeed.","February 7, 2021","User Experience, Tech Responsibility, User Error"

"Circles, networks and the trust layer","The internet clearly has a trust problem. As with most things, it helps to start with the Grateful Dead.
After their incarnation as the Warlocks, they became more than a band. It was a family on the road. There were people who gave up their careers to follow them around, living on buses… they were seeing thirty or forty shows a year. You traded tickets, did favors, built relationships. People in the family knew that they’d be seeing each other again soon.
And then, in 1987,Touch of Greywent to #1 (their only top 40 hit) and it attracted a huge (and different) crowd to the shows. Reports were that the intimacy and trust disappeared.
Glen Weylpoints outthat the internet was started by three tribes, as different from each other as could be. The military was behind the original ARPA (and then DARPA) that built and funded it. Professors at universities around the world were among the early users. And in San Francisco, a group of ‘hippies’ were the builders of some of the first culture online.
Because each of these groups were high-trust communities, it was easy to conclude that the people they’d be engaging online would be too. And so, as the tools of the internet and then the web were built out, they forgot to build a trust layer. Plenty of ways to share files, search, browse, chat and talk, but no way to engage in the very complicated things that humans do around identity and trust.
Humans have been in tribal relationships since before recorded history began. The word “tribe” appears in the Bible more than 300 times. But the internet isn’t a community or atribe. It’s simply a technology that amplifies some voices and some ideas. When we don’t know who these people are, or if they’re even people, trust erodes.
When a site decides to get big fast, they usually do it by creating a very easy way to join, and they create few barriers to a drive-by anonymous experience. And when they make a profit from this behavior, they do it more. In fact, they amplify it.
Which makes good business in the short run, but lousy public policy.
Twenty years ago, I wrote that if someone goes into a bank wearing a mask (current pandemic aside) we can assume that they’re not there to make a deposit.
And now we’re suffering from the very openness and ease of connection that the internet was built on. Because a collection of angry people talking past each other isn’t a community. Without persistence of presence, some sort of identity and a shared set of ideals, goals and consequences, humans aren’t particularly tempted to bring their best selves to the table.
The system is being architected against our best impulses. Humans understand that local leadership, sacrifice and generosity build community, and that fights and scandals simply create crowds. Countless people are showing up, leading and pushing back, but algorithms are powerful and resilient, and we need some of them to be rebuilt.
Until there’s a correlation between what’s popular or profitable and what’s useful, we’re all going to be paying the price.","February 5, 2021","trust, community, internet"
A simple missing word,"“Yet”.
You can append it after any sentence related to your journey of achievement and contribution.
“I haven’t finished the project”
“I haven’t learned how to juggle”
“I haven’t made the sale”
YET.
And along the way, “Yet” turns “can’t” into “haven’t.”
Yetisn’t the result of brazen persistence. It’s what we earn with learning, insight and generosity.

Egomania vs. ego strength,"People talk about ego like it’s a bad thing. But our desire to do a good job, our self-trust, our willingness to dance with fear–these are fuel if used properly.
Egomania pushes us to ignore useful feedback, to bristle at input and to refuse to do the work to get better at our craft. It’s actually a sign of fear and weakness.
Ego strength, on the other hand, makes us eager to learn more, engage with the market and figure out what it will take to have the project actually succeed.","February 3, 2021","Egomania, ego strength, self-improvement"

The urgent advice usually ends with “blogs are dead.”
Like Groundhog Day, we keep repeating the same pattern.
Any platform that’s reasonably open has a long tail. That means that a few people get most of the traffic and most people get very little. If there’s money involved, that’s definitely what happens.
Statistically, whatever you build online isn’t going to get a lot of traffic. There are no magic shortcuts in open systems, because the short head depends on scarcity.

Strategy and tactics and Powerpoint,"Most people build a Keynote or Powerpoint presentation in a very direct way: I have things I want to say, I will list them, slide by slide.
Over time, you might get fancier or more skilled at the tactics of how you present each thing you hope to say, but what if we took a step back and used intention to come up with a strategic framework for the deck.
Overall question: Who is this presentation for?
And the follow-up: What change are we seeking to make?
If you’re not trying to cause an action or some other change in attitude or belief, then what’s the purpose of the deck?
And then, for each sequence of slides, the questions are:
What did this person believe before we got here?
What do I want them to believe after they see this?
Brick by brick, step by step, your slides conspire to cause this change to happen.
The font you choose, your grammar, the size of the letters, the quality of the picture–each of these tactical decisions has a purpose. What’s the change I want this element to contribute to?
The sequence of slides, the tension as you move from one to another–it has a purpose.
It may very well be that your purpose is to create deniability, to get the meeting over with, to have a digital record that you did, in fact, do the work, express your effort and get it off your desk. But it’s entirely possible you can accomplish even more than that.

Errors in personification,"“The sun is trying to break through the clouds.”
“The virus doesn’t like it when people stay home and isolate.”
“The computer didn’t expect you to type that.”
Of course, the sun, the virus and the computer aren’t people. And genes aren’t actually selfish, and new data demonstrates that we don’t really have a lizard brain.
But these aren’t errors at all. It makes it easier to predict what a non-human is going to do if we imagine that it has motivations and preferences that are like ours.
Two problems can arise, though:
The first is when we assert human motivations that don’t actually do a good job of prediction. For example, imagining that events are motivated by some sort of unrelated specific superstition or narrative.
The second is more problematic: It happens when we personalize other people–imagining that they’re not just humans, but they’re us. “If I were you…” is not always a useful predictor, because you’re not me. And vice versa.
Everyone has their own history, their own biases and their own irrationalities. Personification is a useful shortcut if it helps us make smart predictions about others, but it’s a trap if we assume that we’re the only ones who are right.","March 31, 2021","personification, predictions, biases"

Can I use it to open a paint can? Well, sure you can, but you could find easier and cheaper substitutes. And you might get paint on the screwdriver, which would make it much less effective for its real job.
Can I use it to turn this Phillips-head screw? Well, possibly, but you’ll probably strip the screw.
Can I use it to stir my coffee? Well, sure, but why?

Celebrity Art (priceless/worthless),"Why are some paintings so valuable?
Works by Rothko or Matisse are worth millions. The Mona Lisa is truly priceless.
There are four reasons, all working together, all quite relevant today as we remake our culture around digital goods:
Beauty/decoration.Since before the 20,000 year old cavepaintingsin France, we’ve been putting things on our walls. Things that are beautiful, or remind us of important stories, or simply our humanity. It happens regardless of income or culture.
Status/scarcity.When gold became revered for its scarcity, it began to show up in the decorations of households that aspired to be seen as high status. The same happened with spiritual relics and items from antiquity. A decoration that is scarce and in demand acquires a sort of cultural beauty that some people seek out.
The printing press.Until 500 years ago, no given painting (or tapestry) was seen by many people. And then, quite suddenly, images began to spread.Durersold many thousands of the eight editions of his woodcut, and it was one of the first famous pieces of art. And the Mona Lisa? It’s so valuable because it wasstolenjust as newspapers (in color!) were becoming widespread. Her face was on the front page of newspapers around the world, ensuring her celebrity for generations.
While the fame and cultural currency that the printing press created was a boon for artists, art collectors and dealers, it was also a huge problem. If a print could be had for a few dollars, what good is the original? How to satisfy those that sought status from the decoration on their walls?
First and best version.And thus the last pillar. An original oil painting is truly different from a signed print, which is different from the mass market poster. People wait in line to see a famous painting. They gasp in its presence. They take selfies with it, and it elevates the way they feel about themselves and the world.
Museums exist to show us what we all own, our shared cultural heritage, the output of our culture in the form of original work created by artists with something to say.
I’ve sat in the Art Institute for hours, simply breathing the same air as a Magritte. I grew up at the Albright Knox in Buffalo, with the DeBuffet’s, the O’Keefe’s and the Still’s. The Marisol is an old friend. They were worth the trip.
There used to be museums that forbid people from taking photographs. Over time, they’ve come to realize that this is foolish, because sharing the photographs don’t take anything away from the value of the painting, they add to it (though the sometimes annoying act of the person with a flash or a shutter click is a different story).
The top of the painting market is 50 billion dollars or more a year. Wealthy people and institutions trading scarce originals, and sometimes, perhaps, exhibiting them, for the public or for people who come over for dinner. When there’s a huge signed Jill Greenberg on the other side of the dining room table from you, it’s unforgettable.
But now, we’ve taken the printing press to a whole new level. That has made some existing paintings morefamousthan ever. But it has also created a billion images that were never paintings in the first place.
There are millions of painters who aspire to be at the most expensive tier of working artist creating for the auction houses and collectors, but very few achieve this goal every year. And there are countless collectors who buy paintings hoping that there value will soar, but most fail to succeed.
The art market has shifted from something that supports art to something that is mostly a market. Some collectors bought art they didn’t like, simply because they were persuaded that the system would make it increase in value or that their perception of status was so shaky that they needed the next big thing. Some painters were pushed to create painting that would go up in value instead of work they believed in. Museums ended up with tens of thousands of paintings in storage. Wealthy collectors put priceless paintings into tax-free havens, simply as a hedge, not for any of the emotions that painting originally set out to produce.
And now, if you’re a fine artist, hoping to make a living selling canvases for far more than they cost to produce, beauty is insufficient. The market for this sort of status is demanding curation and approval and yes, celebrity.
And if you’re a cyber-person, intent on pushing NFTs (the abbreviation for Non-Fungible Token, unhelpful shorthand for ‘an unduplicatable digital code that’s easy to trade and speculate on’) then it’s worth noting:
Digital tokens aren’t beautiful.
Digital tokens will never make someone gasp.
No one wants to see your hard drive.
It’s quite difficult to display the status or beauty of something that isn’t connected to 20,000 years of cultural expectations, institutional embrace and design evolution. And if you can’t display your status or enjoy the beauty, then it’s simply a speculative trade.
People buy and trade stocks in order to make a profit. Most of them are largely indifferent to what the stock certificate looks like.
I think we’re always going to be hooked on status, and we’re always going to seek beauty. I’m not sure, though, that just because we can marketize and digitize something that it will inherit so many of the cultural tropes that are at the core of the human experience.","March 28, 2021","Art Valuation, Cultural Status, Digital Tokens"
"Price, wants, needs and the perils of urgent","You have a choice to make. There are four quadrants, and the thing you offer can fit into one of them.
Perhaps you make a low-priced treat, something that people want. Wrigley’s gum or Heinz ketchup, or an app that’s fun to use. Because it’s cheap, it might appeal to the masses. Because it’s a ‘want’, you’re not going to kill anyone if it doesn’t work now and then.
In the other corner, you might choose to sell pacemakers. Sure, your profit per unit is in the thousands, but the room for failure is precisely zero. You won’t sell a lot, and every single one of them better work.
The other two corners are also fascinating in their own way.
Perhaps you want to offer a luxury good, something that’s clearly a want, and not a matter of life and death. You won’t sell many of your $15,000 handbags, but that’s okay, because the margins are great. But it better increase my status!
And finally, there’s the tempting but difficult quadrant of low-priced goods that the user feels are mission critical. This is a vial of insulin or a web service that backs up data in real time (which can feel like life or death). Tempting, because people are always happy to pay a bit less for something they really need.

Cons at scale,"Traditional con men do their work one person at a time. It’s a laborious process, earning trust and the benefit of the doubt before ultimately ripping someone off.

It’s in anuncanny valley–almost real, but not quite. And of course, the distance keeps getting shorter.
So the mail merge, the phone spam, the faux intimacy of a stranger. They continue to blur the lines between personal and personalized.

"Certainty, accuracy and leadership","Certainty: Resolute in the face of criticism and implacable when confronting evidence to the contrary. ‘Never in doubt’ is more important than being right. The need to prove strength and consistency often ties us into knots, particularly in a world with new information and insight arriving so often.
Accuracy: Aware that the sum total of our current assertions is a measure of our wisdom, which means that disproven hypotheses should be abandoned as soon as the truth is made clear. The scientific method is a process, not a lab coat or a textbook. Changing one’s point of view is a virtue, not a flaw.
It seems clear that for just about anything that we can measure, if it really matters, accuracy is a better trait than certainty. And yet our instincts and our media cycles seem to push us toward certainty instead.","March 24, 2021","Certainty, Accuracy, Leadership"
Public companies are too often out of alignment,"The public markets can offer a company quite a bit: Cash right now. Liquidity for the future. A currency to help recruiting and retention.
And public companies come with a giant caveat: They are owned by people (the shareholders) who might sell out at any moment. And new ones can take their place in an instant.
This flexible ownership is part of the attraction of the stock market, but it also means that you can’t count on the people and institutions that own your organization taking a long-term view. (Long-term for them might even be a week in the future).
As a result, the others that the organization seeks to serve: The environment, their customers, the employees, the culture… often lose out. Because thanks to Milton Friedman’s mythology, the primacy of the shareholder (the one who drives the stock price, the very stock price that drives management) means that every time these companies seek to serve one of their other constituents, they have to do a sort of dance, explaining to shareholders why, after all, really and truly, what they’re actually doing is serving the shareholders. Not just serving them, serving themright now.
And, thanks to the short-term interests of many people who trade stocks, there’s pressure to own shares that go up the most today, not a company you’re proud to own for the long run.
Sometimes, the enlightened and powerful leadership of a company is able to ignore the whining of the shareholders. If you don’t like where this bus is going, sell!
But over time, that resolve often fades. I saw this first hand at Yahoo. When everyone who works for you and around you is watching the stock price, it’s hard to decide to do the right thing.

But, “I’m sorry that I stepped on your foot,”doesmean that I stepped on your foot.
In creating connection and trying to make amends, we often get confused by the two kinds of ‘sorry’, and don’t apologize because we believe the problem wasn’t our fault.
“I’m sorry that you had to wait two hours while your car was being serviced.” That’s a valid sentence, even if it wasn’t your fault that the schedule was overfull.
“I’m sorry that you’re stranded here and you’re going to miss the big meeting. I know it was important,” is a useful thing to say even if you didn’t cause the snow storm.

It’s clearly not going to be a worldwide mass-market bestseller, so you can focus only on the people who want to hear from you.
It’s a project that is completely and totally up to you.

Resilience,"The world is going to change, and resilience is our best response.
It’s not about building things that always turn out the way we expect. Bulletproof is too expensive, too rigid and requires perfect knowledge of the future.
Resilience is a commitment to a design, an attitude and a system that works even when things don’t turn out the way we planned.Especiallythen.
Instead of designing for the best case scenario, we make the effort to consider how our work thrives when the best case doesn’t arrive. Because that’s far more likely.
Sailors know that fixing on a point on the horizon is a good way to survive a storm.

The dance between the long tail and the short head,"When distribution is scarce, the hits are powerful indeed.
AM Top 40 radio meant that if you made that list of 40 hits, you were going to sell a huge number, and if you didn’t, you were gone.
Giant movie screens meant a few movies could play for months and own the market.
Limited independent bookstores kept a hit on the bestseller list for up to a year.
And then, when thelong tailarrives, there’s a riot ofvariety, with most of the available offerings selling few indeed (most videos on YouTube have fewer than 25 views) but the ones on the shoulders do far better than they ever would before. This happened to movies in the 1990s when the number of screens multiplied, and to cable TV when the premium networks were okay with 3 million viewers for Mad Men.
Excited creators start to imagine infinity. There will be room for an unlimited number of Kindle books or YouTube videos or Netflix shows…
And that’s when the pendulum starts to oscillate a bit.
Because the media business remains a business, and it’s largely built on attention, and attention is scarce and it’s hard to scale.
So instead of an infinite number of successful titles, the market begins to segment. Instead of one blockbuster movie like Jaws that owns the summer for an entire nation, there are multiple markets, multiple audiences. But within those segments, there are still hits. Short heads built on multiple long tails.
Yes, having the most popular podcast in the world is quite valuable. But having the most popular podcast for a particular audience is valuable as well.
And we continue to segment for as long as the attention can be lumped together in valuable ways.
But, at the same time, we live in community, and we have a thirst for the big hit, the one that ‘everyone’ is talking about.
The disconnect occurs when producers and creators try to average things out and dumb things down, hoping for the big hit that won’t come. Or overspend to get there. The opportunity lies in finding a viable audience and matching the project’s focus and budget to the people who truly want it.
And the dance continues.","March 18, 2021","long tail, short head, market segmentation"
The things we go back to,"If you’re used to a messy desk, cleaning it will probably be a temporary measure.

The revolution in online learning,"Not education, learning.
Education is a model based on scarcity, compliance and accreditation. It trades time, attention and money for a piece of paper that promises value.
But we learn in ways that have little to do with how mass education is structured.
If you know how to walk, write, read, type, have a conversation, perform surgery or cook an egg, it’s probably because you practiced and explored and experienced, not because it was on a test.
We’re in danger of repeating the failed approaches of education in an online setting, and today I’m launchinga series of lecturesabout the difference–and how to make online learning work. Opening doors for people so that they can learn is an extraordinary opportunity, one that focuses on possibility, not compliance. No one that I know of has clearly described the elements of this new revolution, so I decided to share what I know.
Since founding the altMBA andAkimboworkshops more than five years ago (it’s now an independent B corp) I’ve been exploring what it means to build new approaches to online learning that work, that scale, and that are effective. The workshops have had a significant impact on more than 20,000 people in 75 countries.
I’ve heard from bestselling authors, founders and high school teachers, all wondering about the best practices for this new moment in learning.
The results that students have achieved in the workshops are completely off the charts. Better completion rates, astonishing amounts of interaction and growth, and most of all, lives transformed.
As 2021 arrives, there’s a huge uptick in learning companies being founded and funded, independent teachers looking for new platforms as well as institutions shifting gears with online learning coming to the fore. Google is launching certificate-granting courses, and schools are continuing to grapple with what it means for students to be remote.
Alas, many of these efforts are unlikely to succeed at their stated goal of creating learning interventions that actually work. Some will be popular because they focus on entertainment instead of learning. And some will remain stuck in the old models of management and compliance.
Fortunately, some of these new efforts will actually facilitate learning for the people who engage with them.
We’ve seen all this before, and my hope is that people who are responsible for what’s getting built will learn from our experience. We’re at the very beginning of a worldwide transformation in how people learn.
If you’re a teacher or an organizer, an investor or a leader, I hope you’ll take a few hours to learn about learning.
I’ve put what I know intoa short series of recorded lectures(not a workshop) on Udemy. (There’s acouponto save you a few bucks–it’s valid for the first 500 people who sign up.) I’m aware of the irony in creating lectures about the power of workshops over lectures, but in this case, I wanted to put a stake in the ground that people could explore on their own and with their teams.
We have a chance to build a future based on contribution, possibility and insight. And we can do it at scale.
The educational regimes of the last century have distracted us. It turns out that the obvious and easy approaches aren’t actually the ones that we need to focus on. When we commit to outcomes, the path is more clear.","March 16, 2021","online learning, education revolution, transformative practices"
Technical generations,"“What’s a fax machine?”
There are people working today who don’t know.
In the 1980s, I produced a book about VCR tapes and video stores that’s so obsolete, you can’t even find a used copy any more.
Technical generations keep getting shorter–A hard drive from ten years ago is probably not going to work with your new laptop.
Contrast this with us. Human generations have been chronicled for thousands of years. We know who begat who.
Lee De Forest, father of radio, was raised by people who voted for Abraham Lincoln, but he died when Bruce Springsteen was twelve years old. That’s not many handshakes from “The Battle Hymn” to “Blinded by the Light”… During that same period of time, we invented and moved on from radio, live TV, nationwide magazines, color TV, cable TV, Compuserve, Yahoo, GeoCities, The Globe, MySpace and 10,000 other steps.
I’ve lived exactly half my adult life in the 20th century and the other half in the 21st. The cycles keep getting faster, but not the human generations. This means that we’re either bringing a bit of insight and wisdom to the changes, or allowing ourselves to be whipsawed, brainwashed or blindsided by all of it.

In search of amusement,"Business models rework the world.
Organize assets. Add labor. Sell something for enough money that you get to do it again, but more.
That’s how we ended up with a $5 chicken in many pots, a car in front of many houses and a world that’s been paved. One cycle at a time, one dollar at a time.
Originally, business models were primarily aboutneeds. You need food, I’ll build a farm. You need shelter, I’ll build houses.
As parts of the world have gotten richer and richer, though, the money that’s spent (which is what business models are based on) has shifted largely towants. One millionaire buying collectible cars spends far more than 100 families buying beans or lettuce.
Marvel spent $400,000,000 to make Avengers: Endgame. Because there was a business model in place that made it a reasonable investment choice.
What if we wanted to cure river blindness or address ineffective policing as much as we wanted to watch movies? The business model would shift and things would change–in a different direction.
I’m not sure there’s an intrinsic reason that watching a particular movie is more satisfying than solving an endemic problem. We’ve simply evolved our culture to be focused on the business of amusement instead of the journey toward better.","March 14, 2021","business models, wants vs needs, amusement文化"

Voting for Fela,"The hall of fame, any hall of fame, is an odd thing. On one hand, it celebrates the status quo and scarcity. On the other, it’s a mark of transitions, evolution and diversity. The people inducted into Cooperstown or some other hall of fame in 2021 probably don’t look or act the way the founders of that institution imagined.
The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is acceptingvotesright now, and Fela Kuti is up against Iron Maiden and other stalwarts of the genre.
And his nomination helps us understand what Scott Page means when he talks about thevalueof diversity within organizations. There are no all-clarinet orchestras because the combination of instruments is precisely why orchestras work.
Pythagoras discovered the fifth hammer, the one that doesn’t sound quite like the others–and that is the hammer that makes the chord work.
Fela Kuti was from a country 2/3 the size of the USA, and yet Nigeria has few musical stars in the US. His impact can be felt in just about all the music we hear, because his music was different, singular and remarkable.
If some of the musicians in the Hall had never existed, rock and roll would not be that different. There are easily available substitutes. But sometimes, a skilled, passionate and talented voice changes things.
Change can happen when a person’s contribution is unanticipated and boundary-stretching. As Carole King’s was. As Fela Kuti’s was.

Practical elegance,"The 16-foot canvas Prospector canoe made by the Chestnut Canoe Company is not the fastest or the lightest or the cheapest canoe but it is an elegant canoe.
Practical elegance is something that is available to all of us. If we choose, it can become the cornerstone of our work.
Some of us make a thing and many of us make a system. What makes something practically elegant is that it’s better, smoother, cleaner, more understandable, kinder, more efficient, friendlier or more approachable than it needs to be.
Microsoft Windows was never particularly elegant, as you could see the nuts and bolts underneath it. It was clunky, but it got the job done.
On the other hand, the Macintosh-for at least 20 years-was surprisingly elegant. When it broke, it broke in an elegant way. It knew things before it asked us to type them in, it had a smile on its face–it seemed to have a sense of humor.
When we create something with practical elegance, we are investing time and energy in a user experience that satisfies the user more than it helps the bottom line of the company that made it. Ironically, in the long run, satisfying the user is the single best way to help the bottom line of a company that doesn’t have monopoly power.
When a designer combines functionality with delight, we’re drawn to whatever she’s produced. That’s the elegance we’re searching for in our built world.
An enemy of practical elegance is persistent complexity, often caused by competing demands, network effects and the status quo. The latest operating system of the Mac is without elegance. When it crashes, and mine has been every few hours for the last week, it crashes poorly. The kernel panic reports are unreadable, by me and by their support folks. The dialogue boxes aren’t consistent, the information flow is uneven and nothing about the experience shows any commitment to polish, to delight or to the user.
Practical elegance doesn’t mean that the canoe will never capsize. It means that the thing we built was worth building, and it left the user feeling better, not worse, about their choice.
Too often, “customer service” has come to mean “answer the phone and give a refund.” But customer service begins long before something breaks. It’s about a commitment to the experience. Creating delight before it’s expected. Building empathy and insight into the interactions that people will choose to have with you.
Of course this takes effort. So do all the other things that go into a product or service. Apparently, though, this effort is perceived as optional by some.
As soon as a product or system creator starts acting like the user has no choice, elegance begins to disappear.","March 11, 2021","Practical elegance, user experience, design"
What does it stand for?,"A common writer’s trick is to introduce a new term by telling you its origin or what the initials stand for.
SMERSH, KAOS, THRUSH, UNCLE, GIF, NFT, SCUBA, CIA, NSA… you get the idea.
But knowing what the initials are for doesn’t tell us what it means.
And learning who coined a word (and why) is interesting but not the point.
We need a new word when the old words are insufficient to express a shared understanding. And the new word is a placeholder for astory.
If we share the same story about a word, about its place, its possibility and its promise–thenwe know what it stands for.
New words give us new ways to understand the world, because new words come with stories attached.
And disagreements often happen simply because while we’re using the same word as someone else, we’re not telling the same story they are.","March 10, 2021","new words, shared understanding, storytelling"

The cataclysmic breakdown of networked systems,"When each car is separate, they’re dumb, and they break one at a time.
When they are part of a networked system, one software glitch can break them all at once.
If we use power off the grid, each house creates its own heat.
If we benefit from an efficient system of distributed power, a rolling blackout can take them all offline at once.
Networks create significant efficiencies at the same time that they produce value that would be impossible without them. And so, relentlessly, we’re hooking everything together.
Along the way, it’s worth reminding ourselves just how valuable resilience is. The only kind of network breakdowns we notice are the cataclysmic ones.
The benefits of a network are immediately forgotten when the whole thing breaks.","March 8, 2021","network breakdown, resilience, efficiency"
The sixth layer,"Humans differentiated themselves 100,000 years ago by developing the ability to have a detailed memory. Not just “where did I hide the acorns” but rich and diverse memories about people and places.
Only a few thousand years ago, we amplified this by making those memories permanent. Telling a story to someone else dramatically increases our memory capacity.
Then we started making and saving our notes.
And then we developed a common language so we could share those notes with others. The library and the cloud meant that your memory could become my memory too.
And only recently we added search, so the memories and insights of a billion or more people could be easily accessed.
The sixth layer, now appearing, is an intelligence that prompts us and tells us what is out there before we even decide to search for it.
No wonder we’re a bit dizzy. We just multiplied our minds by many orders of magnitude. It’s easy to confuse someone else’s memory (or manipulation) with our hard-earned ability to remember things that actually happened to us.
And we’re now realizing that we have the power (and perhaps the obligation) to use shared knowledge to make better, more thoughtful decisions. And to intentionally edit out the manipulations and falsehoods that are designed to spread, not to improve our lives.","March 7, 2021","Memory, Intelligence, Knowledge"
NFTs are a dangerous trap,"Like most traps, they’re mysterious and then appealing and then it’s too late.
An NFT is digital treasure chest, a status symbol and an apparent item of value.
Like a Pokemon card, or an original Picasso drawing or the actual frame of a Disney animated film from 1955, NFTs are designed to be the one and only, a shred of non-fungible reality in a world gone digital.
You either ownthisthing or you don’t.
To make it really clear, considerHonus Wagner. A Honus Wagner baseball card is quite rare (Wagner didn’t permit the card to be made because he wanted nothing to do with cigarettes, foreshadowing some of the stuff below) and so there were fewer than 200 all in before production shut down. One of the cards last sold for more than $3,000,000.
Owning a Honus Wagner card doesn’t mean you own Honus Wagner. Or a royalty stream or anything else but the card itself.
For years, this was part of the business model of the collectible card industry. Make billions of cards, most get thrown out, some rookies get famous, some cards go up in value.
Now, consider an oil painting. Perhaps it was stolen a long time ago, or became famous for other reasons. It’s the one and only. If you somehow owned the Mona Lisa, it wouldn’t mean that you own the woman who is portrayed in it, or any part of DaVinci, it would simply mean you own a canvas, one that others also want to own.
People can look at images of the Mona Lisa all day long without compensating you, because you simply own the original trophy, not the idea…
But having it on your wall gives you a feeling, and telling other people you own it gives you another, slightly different feeling.
It’s worth noting two things about the art example:
So what’s an NFT? It’s a digital token (the same way a Bitcoin is a digital token) except it’s a one and only, like a Honus Wagner, there’s just one. One of these tokens might refer to something else (a video of a basketball shot, an oil painting, even this blog post) but it isn’t that thing. It’s simply a token authorized by the person who made it to be the one and only one. (The NBA has already sold more than $200 million in video clip highlight NFTs)…
And so the trap:
CREATORSmay rush to start minting NFTs as a way to get paid for what they’ve created. Unlike alternative digital currencies which are relatively complicated to invent and sell, it’s recently become super easy to ‘mint’ an NFT. I could, for example, turn each of the 8,500 posts on this blog into a token and sell them on the open market.
The more time and passion that creators devote to chasing the NFT, the more time they’ll spend trying to create the appearance of scarcity and hustling people to believe that the tokens will go up in value. They’ll become promoters of digital tokens more than they are creators. Because that’s the only reason that someone is likely to buy one–like a stock, they hope it will go up in value. Unlike some stocks, it doesn’t pay dividends or come with any other rights. And unlike actual works of art, NFTs aren’t usually aesthetically beautiful on their own, they simply represent something that is.
BUYERSof NFTs may be blind to the fact that there’s no limit on the supply. In the case of baseball cards, there are only so many rookies a year. In the case of art, there’s a limited number of famous paintings and a limited amount of shelf space at Sotheby’s. NFTs are going to be more like Kindle books and YouTube videos. The vast majority are going to have ten views, not a billion. It’s an unregulated, non-transparent hustle with ‘bubble’ written all over it.
THE REST OF USare going to pay for NFTs for a very long time. They use anastonishingamount of electricity to create and trade. Together, they are already using more than is consumed by some states in the US. Imagine building a giant new power plant just to make Christie’s or the Basel Art Fair function. And the amount of power wasted will go up commensurate with their popularity and value. And keep going up. The details arehere. The short version is that for the foreseeable future, the method that’s used to verify the blockchain and to create new digital coins is deliberately energy-intensive and inefficient. That’s on purpose. And as they get more valuable, the energy used will go up, not down.
It’s an ongoing waste that creates little in ongoing value and gets less efficient and more expensive as time goes on. For most technological innovations the opposite is true.
The trap, then, is that creators can get hooked on creating these. Buyers with a sunk cost get hooked on making the prices go up, unable to walk away. And so creators and buyers are then hooked in a cycle, with all of us paying the lifetime of costs associated with an unregulated system that consumes vast amounts of precious energy for no other purpose than to create some scarce digital tokens.

I wrote a book about digital cash twenty years ago. This is precisely the sort of cool project and economic curiosity that I want to be excited about.

You can figure out who’s reading the book because they’ve got something at stake and who’s simply wasting time.
When we adopt the posture of commitment, something extraordinary happens: The lessons get more profound and useful. The questions asked get more specific and urgent. The connections that are made get deeper.
The reason that most online videos and blog posts seem to come and go is because we use a browser to interact with them. “What’s next?” is asked too often.

The most important meal of the day,"Who decides the rhythm of your day? When are you at your best, when do you drag?
In the old days, when we worked on the assembly line or even in sync at the office or at school, there were good reasons to adopt the timing that was assigned to us.
But perhaps it makes sense to take control and listen and notice and work with our patterns, not against them.
High school students perform better when the school day starts later. So let’s organize around that.
If a workout at noon makes your afternoon more effective, it’s hard to see why you need to do it at 5 am in a world that’s digital and more asynchronous than ever before.
If your day is better if your first interactions are positive ones, why not organize a daily call with peers with nothing but that in mind?
And even if your schedule isn’t completely up to you, you might get to decide when to tackle mindless chores and when to work on the creative elements of the new plan. When to read blog posts and when to write them. You may get to decide when to have meetings that challenge your intellect vs. those that require patience…

The weight of repetitive tasks,"As I write this, they’re laying a brick wall outside of my window.
Each brick weighs about five pounds. There are a thousand bricks in this wall. And every brick is moved, one by one, from the truck to the cart to the wall. Over time, any inefficient move is costly indeed. Watching professionals do it gives me more admiration than ever for their commitment and grace.
If we’re lucky enough to work indoors, with free snacks and podcasts in the background, we might not get physically exhausted the way we would moving thousands of pounds of bricks. But the cognitive and emotional toll of repetitive tasks is real, even if doesn’t leave callouses.
The discipline is to invest one time in getting your workflow right instead of paying a penalty for poor digital hygiene every single day.

A seat at the table,"Harvard, Dartmouth and Stanford are always full. The value of their degree is largely based on scarcity. There are always more people who want to get in than they will allow.
That’s intentional. Artificial scarcity to create a credential that appears valuable.
Harvard has enough endowment and tech to offer 50x as many degrees as they currently do.
Now, though, online learning is upending the equation of scarcity.
Do students invest all that time and all that money because they believe they’re going to learn something, or is it simply that they’re going to be awarded a scarce credential?
Because sooner or later, learning wins out. The paper fades, but what you know and who you become lasts.

This Zoom call we’re on, the precious one, where all the right people are on the call, at the same time, ready to see and be seen–you’re really going to spend the first ten minutes having us go around the room and say our names? Really?
This gathering we all came to, back when we could, or when we can again–we’re really going to sit at tables for 10, shouting at each other, while we tolerate loud music and eat lousy food?
This interaction we’re having with the busy professional, the one that we’ve waited for, you’re going to spend it reciting things that we already wrote down on a form?

Confusing identity with strategy,"Who we are isn’t the same thing as what we do.

But when the world changes, opportunities change as well.
All of us struggle when our identity doesn’t match the reality of the world around us.

Uncountable words are understandably difficult to measure at a glance. They don’t fit easily into the industrial mindset, and we’re often pushed to find things that are less mysterious.

That’s not really the hard part. The hard part is doing it when people aren’t sure it can be done.
And in that stage of development, taking notes isn’t nearly as important as taking leaps.

You can’t beat the algorithm,"When a new medium shows up that allocates attention, someone comes out ahead.
They win a Google search, amass a ton of FB followers, hit the jackpot on Twitter or even Clubhouse.
“They picked me!” and the attention feels inevitable. Others see the pennies from heaven and rush in to follow, eager for their share of traffic.
But there is no “they” and you weren’t picked. The algorithm needs to send attention somewhere, and for a while, it sent it over there. But it almost certainly won’t last. Because the ecosystem is changing, all the time.
You can’t post on a same platform twice, because the second time, it’s not the same platform as it was last time.
We have a chance to do work we’re proud of, and to do it for people who care. And maybe we can do it in a way that will lead them to tell the others. Traffic from an algorithm isn’t the point, it’s a random bonus.
No sense being a puppet, especially if you can’t be sure who is pulling the strings or why.","April 27, 2021","algorithm, attention, ecosystem"
Decoding the sign,"A “Deer Xing” sign isn’t there to tell the deer where to cross the road.
It’s there to let drivers know that this is the spot where deer often choose to cross the road.
Because deer can’t read signs, and even if they could, they probably wouldn’t bother to obey them. People, on the other hand, are far more likely to be killed by hitting a deer than they are by a shark bite.
A good signmaker is aware of “who’s it for” and “what’s it for.” In this case, the hope is that drivers will be more careful.
Too often, signs of all kinds (metaphorical signs, not just physical ones), are simply ALL CAPS YELLING about how the signmaker is frustrated about something they can’t control. If you can’t influence something, why are you yelling about it?","April 26, 2021","Deer, Signage, Driver Awareness"
Untenable,"You can build a city below sea level, and it might work for a while, but sooner or later, the water will win.
Trends don’t determine whether we’ll be able to accomplish something tomorrow. But seeing and then understanding the trends allows us to work with the wind at our backs, instead of fighting it.
Consider demographics, technology and science. All three are inexorably moving, and while they can be ignored, sooner or later, they catch up with our project and push against it. We can deny the facts of the world around us, with passion or even vitriol, but trends compound.

Competition vs. activation,"Innovators rarely have a competition problem. The challenge isn’t that your market is buying from an alternative provider–the challenge is that they’re buying from no one.
The work we do and the stories we tell when we seek to create activation are dramatically different from the mindset of competition, and yet the lessons from our culture (sports, mass merchants, politics) are all about competition.
“We’re better than them,” is a competition slogan.
That’s very different from, “things could be better,” or “you’re missing this new thing,” or, “people you admire are already using this.”
If you want to grow, you’ll need to get someone to not only decide that you’re worth their time and money, you’ll need to motivate them to act now instead of later.","April 24, 2021","Activation, Competition, Innovation"

Ending it gracefully,"Just about every business, every initiative and every intervention fails sooner or later.
Since that’s demonstrably true, it’s worth considering how you intend to fail when the time comes.
You can pull out every stop, fight every step of the way, mortgage your house and your reputation–and still fail. Or, perhaps, you can quit in a huff at the first feeling of frustration.
The best path is clearly somewhere between the two. And yet, too often, we leave this choice unexamined. Deciding how and when to quit before you begin is far easier and more effective than making ad hoc decisions under pressure.","April 22, 2021","failure, quitting, decision-making"
The discard pile,"Walking away from something that we’re used to, even if it’s unjust or inefficient or ineffective–it usually takes far too long. Fear, momentum and the status quo combine to keep us stuck.
And so it builds up. The cruft calcifies and it gets in our way, making our world smaller, our interactions less human. What used to be normal is rejected and obsolete. It turns out that the status quo is the status quo because it’s good at sticking around.
But brave people stand up and speak up and take action. And far too slowly, the system starts to change.
Sunk costs are real, but we must ignore them. Culture changes, our standards evolve, opportunities arise.
Better is possible… if we care enough to walk away from what was and brave enough to build something new.","April 21, 2021","discard pile, status quo, change"
The map is not the territory,"And that’s a feature, the reason the map exists.
The phrase reminds us not confuse the diagram or model or overview of the situation with the situation itself. Because they’re not the same.
We make a map so we can leave things out.
By leaving things out, we can help people focus on the core concepts we’re trying to get across. And so, the map of the London subway is not actually the London subway. In fact, it’s not even geographically accurate. That’s okay. The job of the map isn’t to show us precisely where each station is, the job is to make it easier to get around London by showing us a theory of the subway.
And the words someone uses don’t accurately convey everything they’re feeling and thinking. They simply stake out some of that in a way that the speaker hopes will express the point they’re trying to make.

Unsponsored,"When we do our work without regard for a third party, simply to serve the reader, the customer or the story, we’re creating something that’s unsponsored.
The third party shows up when we’re encouraged (by payment or other means) to have multiple objectives. And those usually bring compromise.
When our goals are aligned with those that we serve, we have a rare chance to maximize both. It’s worth seeking out. We’re not unsponsored. We’re sponsored by the very people we’re engaging with.","April 19, 2021","Unsponsored, integrity, audience engagement"

It could be because everyone has a different experience, different data and different goals.
Or, it could be that you are the only one who’s rational.
And it could be that we all like to tell ourselves we’re doing the right thing, but ultimately, all we can do is make choices based on how we see the world.

Bad Company,"The arc of institutions, including governments and corporations, particularly public ones, bends toward short-term thinking, bullying, anti-competitive behavior and laziness.
The antidote is persistent vigilance and heroic leadership.
The organizational math is compelling. When a toxic employee shows up, it might be easier to simply work around him. When competitors engage in graft or corruption, the easy path is to compete in the same way. It’s only fair.
And when employees are rewarded for short-term actions that lead to short-term stock gains, the bad behavior compounds.
Some theorized that cutthroat competitive markets were the antidote to the corroding organization. After all, if your team is losing the game, you’ll get your act together–it works in baseball, they say.
The problem is that short-term competitive markets reward short-term competitive thinking, which, while it might diminish sloth, does little to help in the long run.
The entropy of organizations means that difficult conversations and a positive ratchet of culture change are unlikely to occur on their own.
But there’s an alternative. The alternative is the leader (regardless of her title–authority isn’t the point) who says, “not on my watch.” This is the person who realizes that today at work never happens again, and this opportunity to make things better won’t present itself another time.
Of course, it’s exhausting, because you have to do it every day.
But that’s why it’s such an extraordinary opportunity. Not simply as a competitor, but as a human.

“You’re not that good”,"These are the three problems with creative work.
Thefirstis that when we begin, we’re not that good. This is a fact. The breakthrough for anyone on this journey is adding the word “yet.”
It doesn’t pay to pretend that we’ve figured it out before we have. It’s counterproductive to adopt a brittle attitude in the face of criticism. In fact, during this stage, “you’re not that good,” is precisely what we need to hear, because it might be followed with insight on how to get better.
Thesecondis that once we start to build skills and offer something of value, some people are going to persist in believing that we’re not that good. Fine. They’ve told us something about themselves and what they want and need. This is a clue to offer our leadership and contribution to someone else, someone who gets what we’re doing and wants it. The smallest viable audience isn’t a compromise, it’s a path forward. Find the folks who are enrolled and open and eager. Serve them instead.
The danger is that when you hear rejection during this stage, you might come to believe that you’ve accomplished nothing, as opposed to realizing that you might simply be talking to the wrong people.
And thethirdcomes full circle. Because it’s possible that in fact, we’re not that good yet, and there aren’t enough people who want what we’ve got. We’re simply not good enough for this part of the market. So we embrace that truth and begin at the beginning. We’re not good enoughyet. We haven’t practiced enough, found enough empathy, understood the genre well enough and figured out how to contribute. Yet. At least for this audience.
And then we get better.
Sooner or later, these three problems become three milestones on the road to making a difference and doing work we’re proud of.

Identity is often used against us,"Identity feels permanent, powerful, emotional and fragile.
Identity has been used to unite college alumni (“we are!”), political factions and groups of all kinds.
Criticism is not in short supply, especially lately, and criticism aimed at us, at our core self, is particularly hurtful.
“I don’t like you,” is hard to wrestle with.
That’s why ad hominem attacks on appearance and other permanent attributes we all have are so difficult to live with.
But “you” is not the car you drive, the kind of wine you drink or how you feel about a certain issue in our society. Those are choices. Those are tastes. Those can be changed.
When I say I don’t like your idea, I’m not saying that I don’t like you. And if we’ve been persuaded by marketers and politicians that everything we do and say is our identity, then it gets very difficult to learn, to accept useful feedback and to change.
Evolving our choices and our tastes is part of being human. Establishing your identity as someone who is not static, open to change and eager for better makes it far easier to engage in a world where some would prefer us to do precisely the opposite.","April 12, 2021","Identity, Change, Criticism"
All things being equal,"Those are four words that are often overlooked when we focus on the rest on the sentence instead.
“All things being equal, pick the cheapest option.” Or, “All things being equal, go with the one that creates new opportunities.” Or perhaps, “All things being equal, stick with what you’ve got.”
The thing is, all things are rarely equal.
We rush over the equal part and race to the second part of the clause, going for the cheaper one or whatever the organizational default is.

Perfect is not the same as perfectionism,"Perfectionism is a cudgel and a way to hide.
Perfect is the often-attainable outcome of meeting spec. “That’s perfect!” says the delighted patron.
Modern perfect: A plane that doesn’t crash, a bus that leaves on time. Surgery that fixes a broken valve and a computer program that doesn’t cause a kernel panic. These are the building blocks of our built world.
Perfectionism is a way to berate others for not meeting imaginary standards. Or berating ourself as a way to avoid shipping the work.
The perfectionist desires an outcome that can never be achieved. That’s why they’re a perfectionist–to hide behind the impossible.
Few things outside of mathematics are ever truly perfect. But our definition of spec gives us room to do the work. The bus that comes early does no one any favors.
Making promises and keeping them is the path of someone who seeks to contribute. We need better specs, usefully functioning systems and more reliable promises.
Holding back for too long because it could be somehow better than spec, though, is a way to avoid contributing. And using power or privilege to insist that others meet our ever-increasing but ever-less-useful standards is unhelpful.
Better? Sure. Work for that.

“What’s the hard part?”,"A useful way to get in sync.
“What’s the hard part” is a question that everyone on the team should be able to answer. But you won’t find out unless you ask the question.
You might discover that many people think the hard part is directly related to whattheydo all day. And you might discover that some people insist that the hard part has nothing to do with what they do all day–even if it does.
What is the difficult work that, if it went well, would transform the impact of this project? Where are the projects worth focusing on, the things that would be difficult to outsource in a productive way?
When we roll all of this up to the enterprise, it’s up to the CEO to be clear about what the hard part really is – the solvable problem that if it were solved would make a significant difference for the enterprise.
Almost all the cycles involved in creating and building something aren’t particularly difficult. They’re important, certainly, we can’t ride the bike unless it has wheels. But wheels aren’t hard to find and purchase at a fair price.
A team’s awareness and focus on the hard parts dramatically shifts the prospects for the project.","April 8, 2021","team dynamics, challenges, project management"
Fixing Zoom calls: Looking better and feeling better,"It’s time to get serious about how we show up in remote meetings.
For a year, we slogged through it, but it was exhausting. Not only did we feel lousy at the end of the day, but other people rarely saw us at our best.
Now that it’s clear that the nature of work and meetings has changed forever, perhaps this is a good moment to embrace what’s possible.
I’ve put together a rig in my office that is noteworthy for two reasons:
Here’s a shortsample.
And here’s a photo of what it looks like from my side.
Here’s how to do it.
First! It’s free, it takes about one minute and will change the way you feel at the end of the day. In Zoom, find the button for HIDE SELF VIEW. (Here’s alink). What this means is that as in real life, you won’t be able to see yourself. It turns out that looking in the mirror all day wears us out. You’ll have to change the setting at the start of every meeting (this should be high on their list of things to fix) but it’s pretty easy.
By hiding your face from your screen, you can focus more on everyone else in the meeting.
Second, also free: rearrange your workspace so that light is not coming from behind you.
The next steps cost more in setup and money, and I’ll cover them from easiest to most involved. Part of the magic of video meetings is that without a commute or fancy equipment beyond a phone or a laptop, people could join. But it’s become clear that it’s possible to deliver more fidelity and impact by investing in some tech.
Just as we don’t hesitate to buy a new outfit for a big meeting, or pay $500 for a plane ticket, these are investments, and in the scheme of your career, they’re pretty reasonable–and your boss should pay for them:
Get some LED lights. They’re incredibly cheap now (here’s asample, but shop around.) Set them up to the left and right of your screen, a few feet behind it.
Get an external DSLR camera and hook it up to your Mac or PC. This is a much bigger commitment, but the difference it makes is startling.
You’ll need acamera, atripod, and acapture box. Again, all three have alternatives, feel free to shop around. I usethiscapture box, but your mileage may vary. (And scroll down to the end of this post for a camera alternative)
How it works: The camera goes on a tripod and sits just above and slightly behind your computer screen. The HDMI output goes to your capture box and then into your computer. In Zoom, change the camera from your computer to the camera. Done. It also pays to get a power cable for your camera so it doesn’t run out on you. (You can add a microphone while you’re at it).
And then, there’s one last step, which has been the biggest leap for me since the self-view insight.
When you look at the camera in a zoom call, you’renotlooking at the person you’re talking with. You’re staring over their head if you’re looking at the camera, or, possibly, you’re looking at them, but it appears to them that you’re looking at your keyboard. Either way, there’s no eye to eye connection.
This is unnatural. You’d freak out if you had a real life meeting with someone who never made eye contact. And it’s really tiring, because you end up spending your time not doing something humans evolved to do, which is look at each other.
The alternative? A beam splitter.
These are used for teleprompters. It’s basically a piece of fancy glass, at an angle, on top of a monitor or screen. Behind the glass is the camera.
You can look directly at the glass, and the camera behind it, but instead of looking at the glass and the camera, what you’re actually looking at is the teleprompter or the stuff that’s on the screen.
It’s magical.
This setup is now far cheaper than I expected. Here’s a typicalbeamsplitterwith hood and mount, and here’s amonitorthat should fit with it. Total cost under $300.
[or if you’ve already got a late-model iPhone or iPad along with a Mac, there’s a new app calledReincubate Camo, which is a much better product than the name implies. It allows you to skip buying an external camera and use the device tethered to your Mac instead. You’ll still need a tripod, still and you can probably make it work with the beamsplitter…]
The entire setup, all of the things that I’ve listed above, comes to less than $1,000–less than half of that if you already have a camera or useCamo. If you go to a meeting a day, that’s a few dollars a meeting over the course of a year.
It’s not for everyone, but if you are looking for the tools to be more productive, I hope it helps.","April 7, 2021","Zoom calls, remote meetings, video setup"
Jobs to be done,"The dog needs to be fed, there’s a blog post to write, a report is due, there’s a meeting at 10, this form from the bank has to be submitted…
We can measure our performance (and our days) by how well we’re doing the jobs to be done. They focus our attention and our effort and create positive outcomes when we do them on time (and negative ones when we don’t).
12 or more years of school are nothing but this. Training in awareness of jobs to be done, and applying the minimum amount of effort to get those jobs done. Show me your list of jobs to be done and I’ll have a good idea of how you spend your time and the impact you’re making.
Easily overlooked, though, is the process of how something gets on our agenda or doesn’t. Working on voting rights, paying attention to voices unheard, grabbing possibilities for learning or growth or contribution–these are easy to ignore if they’re not on the list of jobs to be done.
And the people whodohave these on their list… part of their job is to put their issue on our lists.
As soon as you sign up for a social network, it becomes a job to be done. And the moment you take investment for a new company, your jobs to be done completely change.
This gets meta pretty quick: one of the jobs to be done is to be clear about what the jobs to be done are, and whether or not they are therightjobs.
And another one of the jobs to be done is helping other people see that the things we care about belong on their list of jobs to be done.

Enrollment,"It’s more productive to offer directions to someone who has already decided to go on the journey.
“How do I get there?” is a much easier transaction than, “you must go.”
When there’s mutual enrollment, we call it alignment. If people in the organization are all committed to a similar destination, management becomes more like coaching. In fact, we end up calling them a team instead of a company or a division. Instead of using authority, discipline and extrinsic rewards, teams that are enrolled in the journey are more likely to look for signposts of progress. Instead of focusing on shortcuts, competition and scarcity, teams that are enrolled are more resilient, cooperative and committed.
Public school has confused us about how important enrollment can be. That’s because organized schooling is mandatory, and ‘enrollment’ is simply something that happens on paper, not emotionally.
It’s far easier to coach a spirited cricket team than it is to teach those very same kids improper fractions. That’s obvious–in the first case, they’re enrolled in the game, and in the second, they’re simply complying with as little effort as possible.
AsAnthony Iannarinosays, “too many leaders use their organizational authority instead of inviting people to an adventure, one with meaning, and one that will require growth. Leaders mistakenly believe everyone is motivated by money.”
There’s a hierarchy to enrollment.
At the most primitive level, it’s a desire to evade punishment, to avoid banishment, to stay alive and preserve the status quo. There are no dreams here, simply fear.
Sometimes, this evolves into a mutually beneficial entanglement between the boss and the bossed. The enrollment turns into a desire to please, a figurehead-focused loyalty and dedication that often ends poorly because there’s nothing beyond the dyad. Without external signposts, solipsism and dittoheads result.
More common and more resilient is the enrollment in the tribe. “People like us do things like this.” This is the culture we each choose to live in, the narrative of what it means to choose to be an insider. Status roles and affiliation in a perpetual dance. Enrollment in the group seems to be the dominant form of the human condition, and it’s a place where many leaders and marketers do their best work.
But peer-to-peer enrollment can co-exist with the individual’s desire for meaning and contribution. This is where dreams live and leaders come from. When people enroll in a journey to make things better through effort and contribution, they’re finding a source of inspiration and sustenance from within.
Money, cash money, is a blunt instrument used by organizations and individuals to short circuit much of the hierarchy of enrollment. The idea is that it’s a multi-purpose signifier, an easy way to say, “whatever you seek, whether it’s money for food or money to build a hospital wing, do this and you’ll get some.” And then, to make it even more brutally effective, money as an inducement is combined with the threat of banishment, with keeping someone on the knife’s edge of survival, either financial or emotional.
But money is a story, and it’s a story that is interpreted differently by different people in different moments. When we default to a simple number, we dehumanize the transaction and fail to see what people really need and want.
Where does enrollment come from? It’s certainly easier to start by hiring or leading people who are already enrolled. This is what happens with Major League Baseball calls someone up from the minors. They’re not trying to persuade this person to like baseball, and the promotion from sub-minimum wage to hundreds of thousands of dollars isn’t the lever, either. Dreams realized is enough.
But where do the dreams come from in the first place? I think it might be a combination of two things:
Enrollment is a combination of what we do and what we’ve been surrounded by. Appropriate difficulty followed by learning. Peer support and peer pressure. Expectations understood and perhaps met. Small steps that lead to an appetite for effort and outcomes.
It’s almost impossible to manage someone to enrollment, but we can lead them there.",,"Enrollment, leadership, motivation"
Three kinds of ‘fied’,"Qualifiedmeans that you’ve done the work, earned our trust and could be invited to join us. More than ever, our current technology and the lack of gatekeepers mean that your body of work could earn you the benefit of the doubt and give you a chance to speak up.
Disqualifiedis what happens if you make big promises but don’t keep them, or if you expose intent that isn’t in alignment with what the rest of us expect or need.
Unqualifiedis rare. As in, “you have our unqualified support.” Getting the benefit of the doubt long after most people would have lost our trust is a hard-won privilege. It’s hard to earn unqualified support, and if you do, careful not to waste it.
And too often, before we even begin looking at skill, we’re judging people for other reasons. That’s wrong and it’s wasteful as well. Being confused about what makes someone qualified or not perpetuates injustice.","April 4, 2021","Qualification, Trust, Support"

The 30-foot rule,"If you’re designing a package, a cover, a fashion or even a meme…
The goal is to have it be recognizable from across the room.
That doesn’t mean it has to be loud or interruptive. But when we’re looking for it, we should be able to pick it out of a crowd.
‘Across the room’ isn’t about distance, it’s about the emotional gap, about clutter and about the status quo.
Being distinctive is a choice, and it’s not an easy one. Because it requires you to stand for something and to serve a specific audience, not everyone.
A visit to the supermarket demonstrates the power of this approach. Justin’s peanut butter, Pirate Booty snacks and the distinctive Coke bottle all pass the test. So do the best book covers.

No fooling,"When the world was small, our understanding of ‘reality’ was consistent, which is why a good April Fool’s joke felt right. It tweaked the normal just enough to cause us to wonder about what else might not be as it seems.
But the onslaught of manipulated media and amplified division has pushed us away from our small circle of reality. Now we’re aware that so many people have a different lived experience than we do. And we are exposed–sometimes several times a minute–to falsehoods, scams and bullying.
The first of April was a day when we were supposed to be aware that not everything was as it seemed, that we should be on our guard. And now, exhausting as it is, every day is like that.

Identity and ideas,"We rarely do or say something intentionally that surprises us. That’s because we are in intimate contact with the noise in our heads–we spend our days looking in the mirror, listening to our inner voice and defining our point of view. “That’s not the sort of thing I would say or do…”
We call this internal familiarity our ‘identity.’ If it gets lost (when someone joins a cult, for example), it’s noteworthy and can be tragic.
If our ideas are equated to our identity, then talking about ideas is very much the act of talking about yourself.
And thus the tension is created. Our culture and our economy are built on ideas. Many of our society’s ideas get better over time (you don’t go to the barber for bloodletting any longer–it’s what probably killed George Washington) and yet some of them get stuck. Often, we need a generation to step away before an entrenched idea begins to fade, because the people who have been embracing that toxic or outlived idea see it as part of their identity.
As the media realizes that they can improve profits by narrowcasting ideas to people who embrace them as part of who they are, it gets increasingly difficult to have a constructive conversation about many ideas–because while people are able and sometimes eager to change some of their less personal ideas, we rarely seek to change our identity.
It doesn’t have to be this way.
If you’re doing a jigsaw puzzle and a piece you thought fit in a spot where it doesn’t actually fit, that missed fit is viewed as useful information. Go ahead and try the piece in a different spot–that’s not a threat to your identity as a puzzle solver. In fact, your identity as a puzzle solver is tied up in the idea that if the evidence shows a piece didn’t fit, you simply try a new spot, you don’t feel threatened or disrespected.
The most successful problem solvers are people who have embraced this simple method–your current idea isn’t your identity, it’s simply a step closer to a solution to the problem in front of you.
One way to define our identity is to fall in love with an idea (often one that was handed to us by a chosen authority). Another is to refuse to believe our identity is embodied in an idea, and instead embrace a method for continually finding and improving our ideas.","May 31, 2021","Identity, Ideas, Problem Solving"

“Take your time”,"It means two very different things.
When a person or a marketer takes your time, they’re stealing. Something irretrievable is gone. If your time is taken for selfish reasons, if it’s wasted, there’s no good way to get it back.
On the other hand, when you have enough confidence to take your own time, to take your time to be present, to do the work, to engage with what’s in front of you right now, it’s a gift.
This is precisely what time is for.
We’re not in a race to check off as many boxes as we possibly can before we are out of time. Instead, we have the chance to use the time to create moments that matter.

How to miss a deadline,"In my earlier post, I opened a discussion about how to avoid missing a deadline.
But what happens if you can’t avoid it?
Projects are always on the frontier, combining elements and ideas and effort to do something that’s not been done before, not quite the way we’re doing it here and now.
And so, bold projects sometimes fail to make their deadline. Even if we build systems and use buffers, sometimes it doesn’t work.
Some thoughts:

How (not) to miss a deadline,"Deadlines are valuable, and deadlines are expensive.
Organized systems and societies need deadlines. It would be impossible to efficiently build a house if the subcontractors could deliver their goods or services whenever it were convenient for them. Movie studios and book publishers schedule their releases months in advance to allow distribution teams to plan their work. Software is dependent on subsystems that have to be in place before the entire program can work.
Along with the value that synchronized deliverables create, there are also real costs. Not simply the organizational cost of a missed deadline, but the significant damage to a reputation or brand that happens when a promise isn’t kept. And there’s a human cost–the stress and strain that comes from working to keep a promise that we might not have personally made, or that might be more difficult because someone else didn’t perform their part of the dance.
In the wide-open race for attention and commitments, the standards of deadlines have been wavering. For forty years, Saturday Night Live has gone on at 11:30. Not, as its creator says, because it’s ready, but because it’s 11:30. That’s the deal.
On Kickstarter, this sort of sacrosanct deadline is rare indeed. “This charger will ship in six weeks!” they say, when actually, it’s been more than a year with no shipment date in sight. Or with venture capitalists and other backers. “We’re going to beat the competition to market by three months.” Sometimes it feels like if the company doesn’t bring wishful thinking to the table, they won’t get funded. Given that choice, it’s no wonder that people get desperate. Wishful thinking might not be called lying, but it is. We should know better.
Earning the reputation as someone (a freelancer, a marketer, a company, a leader) who doesn’t miss a deadline is valuable. And it doesn’t happen simply because you avoid sleeping and work like a dog. That’s the last resort of someone who isn’t good at planning.
Here are some basic principles that might help with the planning part:
Like most things that matter, keeping deadlines is a skill, and since it’s a skill, we can learn it.

"Sunk costs, creativity and your Practice","“Ignore sunk costs” is the critical lesson of useful decision making.
The thing you earned, that you depend on, that was hard to do–it’s a gift from your former self. Just because you have a law degree, a travel agency or the ability to do calligraphy in Cyrillic doesn’t mean that your future self is obligated to accept that gift.
We hold on to the old competencies and our hard-earned status roles far longer than we should. The only way to be creative is to do something new, and the path to something new requires leaving something else behind.
New decisions based on new information are at the heart of leadership. But you can’t make those decisions if you’re also busy calculating how much the old decisions cost you.
Creativity is the generous act of solving an interesting problem on behalf of someone else. It’s a chance to take emotional and intellectual risks with generosity.
Do that often enough and you can create apracticearound it. It’s not about being gifted or touched by the muse. Instead, our creative practice (whether you’re a painter, a coach or a fundraiser) is a commitment to the problems in front of us and the people who will benefit from a useful solution to them.

Industrial scale and brittleness,"Look at that banana, just look at it.
Bananas are a modern miracle. They’re cheap, nutritious, and readily available.
And just about every banana you’ve ever eaten (if you live in the Northern Hemisphere) came from the same tree.
Not just a similar tree, the way oak trees are all similar to one another. The same exact tree, which was planted in a hothouse in England about a hundred and fifty years ago. The Cavendish banana tree (named after the family that’s now called theDuke and Duchess of Devonshire) is sterile. It has no seeds. The only way to grow one is to take a cutting from an existing tree and basically grow a clone.
Because the tree was optimized for yield and taste, we end up with plentiful, delicious, cheap bananas.
Until a blight arrives. And the virus that’s just around the corner is almost here, and it will wipe out every single Cavendish tree on Earth in just a few more years.
There have been real environmental side effects all along, but at scale, they become impossible to ignore.
Or consider the legal system in my country. It grew from a fairly informal and resilient (if not always fair) way to keep the peace and settle disputes into a behemoth, which combines the prison-industrial complex with a very expensive civil suit system that’s beneficial to many of the key players but ultimately insensitive to those that can’t use it to their advantage.
Check out Rohan Pavuluri’s newTED talkabout bankruptcy, or Bryan Stevenson’surgent talkon criminal justice.
People aren’t bananas, and the injustices that the legal system has created have always been shameful. But at scale, immense scale, they’re even worse.
Industrial scale seems to pay off. Until it doesn’t. And then it’s on us to change it, while there’s still time.","May 25, 2021","industrial scale, Cavendish banana, legal system"
The consequence,"Attitude follows action far more often than action follows attitude.

Code words,"That’s all language is.
“Banana” is not a fruit. It’s a word that we use in English to identify a fruit.
And code words work beautifully as long as the person you’re seeking to communicate with understands the word the way you think they do.
Often, when people with goodwill and shared values end up disagreeing, it’s because they didn’t understand the code words that were being used.
In fact, it might be the only reason.","May 23, 2021","language, communication, code words"
The right amount of time,"Eventually, the culture figures out how much time we’re supposed to spend on something. They call it the “right” amount. How long an education should take, or an RFP. How fast to deliver on an order. How long to shop around for a new car. How much time to spend with a patient. How much time should be devoted to learning a new skill or engaging with a new idea…
If you spend about the same amount of time as everyone else, you’re likely to get about the same amount of benefit.

To stay the same,"Willem de Kooning said, “I have to change to stay the same.”
Because whatever system we’re in is changing. Because every step we take changes the ground we walk on. Because while you’re busy trying to keep it all together, someone else is working just as hard to change it again.
Some organizations, artists and leaders work to disrupt and innovate.
And some seem content to close their eyes and will things to be exactly as they were yesterday or last year.
Between the innovator and the laggard, though, is most of us. Surfing and dancing with possibility, simply to continue to serve and keep our promises.
What you do isn’t how you do it. What you do is the promise you make to the people you serve. If the people change, then the specifics of your promise have to change as well.

“That’s not fair”,"When we say this, we might not be as accurate in our description of the situation as we believe.
Perhaps we mean, “that’s not what I was hoping for.”
Or we might mean, “if you knew how hard I worked, you would have made a different decision.”
Possibly, we mean, “if you understood the world the way I do, you’d agree that this outcome isn’t fair.”
We rarely complain about fairness when the world lines up the way we hope it will. Even (or especially) if the outcome was unfair to someone else.
There’s an enormous amount of unfairness all around us. People who don’t get the benefit of the doubt, advantages that are multiplied, systems that are rigged. But right here, right now, it’s possible that what just happened was fair, though it was also disappointing.","May 17, 2021","fairness, disappointment, perspective"
Good fences,"Hand washing used to be controversial.
BeforeIgnaz Semmelweisdid his groundbreaking work in proving that disease spread when doctors didn’t wash before and after treating patients, hygiene was ignored. In fact, it took decades for the system to change.
Today, of course, it’s understood that doctors, food service workers and everyone else ought to wash their hands to protect those around us. Doctors don’t wash their hands because they enjoy it, they do it because that’s what doctors do.
Disease evolves.
As it spreads from one person to another, a disease reproduces and has a chance to mutate. And those mutations create new problems, problems that we may be ill-equipped to deal with.
And disease is frightening. When it collides with culture, culture often demands we stand still. We stick with what we know, with what feels safe, with the status quo. Because to do otherwise means that we have to acknowledge that perhaps one day, the disease will win.
It’s easier to sell a new fashion or a sports team than it is to sell public health. Like most of the human challenges we face, it’s a marketing problem, a chance to use words and affiliation and possibility to create change.
There’s a longhistoryof culture pushing back on the smart, generous, safe interventions that ultimately become standard. Because the status quo is the status quo precisely because it’s good at sticking around.
When we have a chance to make things better for the people we care about, we usually realize that this is exactly the thing we hope to do. But first, we need to see what our choices are based on and where they lead.","May 16, 2021","hygiene, disease, culture"

Denialism is not skepticism,"Resolutely refusing to accept a conventional understanding is a statement of certainty.
That’s different from honest skepticism. The skeptic offers an open mind and is clear about what would be necessary to earn enthusiastic support.
The denialist, on the other hand, is sure. Now and forever. This certainty probably doesn’t come from the matter being discussed. Instead, it’s based on external factors, a story, a cultural connection, something that is fueled by the feeling that comes from refusing to examine the issue, not by honest inquiry.

Selling hours,"This might be the workplace question of the decade.
Does the boss buy your time or your productivity?
In the pre-industrial age, when we worked from home (“cottage industries”) workers got paid by the piece.
As we moved to factories, it shifted. Many workers preferred a reliable regular paycheck, and owners decided to profit by investing in productivity and keeping the upside. When new machines show up, the workers don’t get paid more, but the boss makes more.
Now, as work-from-home promises/threatens to become a norm for many knowledge workers, the question is back.
Some bosses are demanding workers return to the office, and some managers have spent the last year forcing people to endure endless zoom meetings. The mindset seems to be that if your time is what got purchased, the boss wants to be sure you’re spending all of that time at work on work, not, who knows, tending for an ill family member or something.
But as it gets easier to measure productivity and contribution, and as it gets easier to outsource any task that can be described clearly, there’s a fork in the road:
If we’re not buying or selling hours, what, exactly do we measure and how are we compensated for it? Are workers ready or open to getting a commission, a profit-share or a per-piece price? And if we’re not selling our time but our contribution, does that further self-center the culture?
And if we are buying and selling hours, how does that work when surveillance capitalism bumps into workers needing flexible schedules and the trust that it takes to develop leadership and creative contribution?
Is it okay with you, the boss, if one of your workers dramatically increases productivity through some outsourcing or tech shortcuts on their own nickel and then goes home at 2 pm every day?
Is it okay if you have another worker who works until midnight every night but doesn’t get nearly as much done?
What about a team of five deciding to skip most of their meetings, coordinate through a shared doc and put the time they save into going for a walk or thinking about the next breakthrough?
If it’s truly about what we produce, how many people on the team are aware of how much they produce? What would happen if they were?
The theory of the firm was based on two key assumptions: That workers needed to be in physical proximity to each other, and that communicating with and measuring outsiders was simply too expensive to scale. For a lot of knowledge work, neither is completely true any more, and so we have to reckon with what the right size of a ‘firm’ even is.
The very nature of the factory and employment is completely up in the air. Instead of bragging about how many employees a company has, how big the office is, how many folks are in any given meeting… some leaders may start optimizing for how few they need to get the work done.",,"Productivity, Work-from-home, Compensation"

Why the blockchain matters,"But first, let’s understand some words…
Bitcoinis not the blockchain. If the blockchain is a printing press, Bitcoin is a kind of paper money. There are countless things that one can do with a printing press, in fact, it changed the world, but the invention of paper money isn’t even one of the top 100 most important outputs the printed press created.
Cryptocurrencyhas a terrible name. Most people associate “crypto” with spies and secrets. And a currency is generally backed by a nation, with a treasury, an exchequer and banks.
It’s more accurately thought of as atoken.
If you went to an amusement park, you might buy a bunch of tokens or tickets to go on the rides. And if you run one of the rides, you collect the tokens, which at some point, you can trade in for a different sort of value, probably currency.
If people need tokens and they’re scarce, they go up in value. If people think that tokens are going to go up in value, they might buy them in anticipation of that. And the things that people do to get tokens can range from simply buying them with paper money (!) to performing various tasks (like the ride operators in the example above).
And, if a lot of people own tokens, they’re likely to do things that make tokens go up in value. Thus, an ecosystem is born.
Okay, so what’s the blockchain?
It’s a database.
Unlike most databases, it’s not controlled by one entity and it’s not easily rewritten. Instead, it’s a ledger, a permanent, examinable, public database. One can use it to record transactions of various sorts.
It would be a really good way to keep track of property records, for example. Instead, we have title insurance, unsearchable folders of deeds in City Hall and often dusty tax records.
There are databases everywhere around us (Facebook, for example, is mostly a database–who are the users, who do they know, what do they do?). Because the internet rewards people who own networks so handsomely, these organizations continue to gain in power. Google began by building a database on top of the open internet, and they’ve spent the last twenty years relentlessly making the internet less open so they can fortify the power of their databases and the attention they influence or control.
And that’s the first reason that the blockchain matters—because there’s a chance that it might lead to more open, resilient, market-focused networks and databases. It’s only a chance, though, because all the hype around the tokens sometimes makes it seem more likely that financial operators will simply seek to manipulate unregulated markets for their own benefit.
The second reason might support positive change. The existence of tokens and decentralization means that it’s possible to build resilient open source communities where early contributors and supporters benefit handsomely over time. No one owns these communities, and we can hope that these communities will work hard to serve themselves and their users, not the capital markets or other short-term players.
Consider a project like Wikipedia. Tens of thousands of people have devoted millions of hours to working to build it. 5,000 active editors are responsible for most of the work that we benefit from every day. This is unpaid work, done for the community and for the satisfaction and status that comes with it.
But of the top 100 websites, there are very few that are built on this model.
Now imagine a blockchain/token project in which contributors earned tokens as they built it and supported it.
Over time, the decentralized project would go up in value. As the ecosystem and the market delivered more and more utility to more and more people, the users would need to buy tokens to use it. And the holders of tokens would receive either a dividend or have the ability to sell their tokens if they chose.
Early speculators would attract more attention, and people with more skill than capital could invest by contributing early and often.
As the project reached a steady state, the stakeholders would shift, from innovators and speculators to people who treat their daily contributions as a job without a boss. Innovators could build on top of this network without permission, creating more and more variations and choice using the same underlying database.
One way to consider this: The open web led to a huge leap in the number of useful databases that we all use (things like Zillow, Instagram and even Tinder). They were fairly cheap to launch and run, and once the network effect kicked in, the profits were significant. Investors were eager to fund the next one, because the odds of a big win dwarfed most of what they could choose from in traditional businesses.
But dominant players are now working to make the openness of the web (the thing that allowed them to grow in the first place) less open. Google and Facebook and others push to make their stock price go up, not to serve users and others who now understand they have little choice in the matter.
The distributed nature of the blockchain, combined with this novel way of funding early contributions means that the network effect may very well bring powerful new databases to the fore, creating new ways for us to interact.
It’s hardly going to be perfect. There’s the issue of how the blockchain itself is run. If it’s run on the original method—proof of work—it’s likely to be a carbon disaster, getting worse as it succeeds. Fortunately, there are new approaches on the horizon (with great names like ‘proof of stake’ and ‘sharding’) that might address these problems.
For the typical user, the existence of the blockchain itself won’t matter, just as you don’t need to know how many volunteer editors Wikipedia has to benefit from using it.
The reason the blockchain matters is that it is an agent of change. Just like the transistor and yes, the printing press, when an agent of change shows up, it often leads to shifts that we probably didn’t expect.
