Death of a myth?,"There are plenty of myths that have far outlasted the data that showed them to be wrong. “The Earth is flat”, “Heavy objects fall faster than light ones” and Noah’s Ark all come to mind. The most expensive myth around today, though, could be the $220 Billion (with a “b”) spent on unmeasured advertising every year.
Check outmlifefor a rare post-dotcom-crash example of big spending for a web launch. Here in New York you’ll see them on taxi tops, posters, big ads, the whole nine yards. Visit the site and it won’t even say what they do until they launch next week. Go figure.
Randall Rothenberg is almost always right, and he’s correct again in the start of thiscolumn. Entire media companies are about to bite the dust because advertisers are just now (fifty years later) realizing that almost all ad money is wasted… but now, they can tell which part works.
Myths make people emotional, of course, and there’s bound to be plenty of angst before this argument is settled. I mean, I just bought a lot of ads for my new book, but I did it with my eyes opened and my accountant’s eyes clearly focused on the results we generated. I don’t think direct advertising is in any danger of going away…(like it or not, spam appears to be here for a while too), but I just don’t get the whole Super Bowl commercial thing.","January 31, 2002","Advertising myths, wasted ad spending, media companies"
What’s the Frequency?,"If you’re hearing a buzzing in your ear, it may be all the wifi radiation out there. A simple in-office networking technology has morphed into a low-cost wireless ISP technology that’s spreading pretty fast.WiFi Metro.comshows you one example. (Though I’m told there are other options in the NY area that are a little more streamlined for sending mail.
The basic idea is to use 802.11b (aka “wifi”) to do something it wasn’t intended to do. Basically, it’s like using cordless phones outside of your house. By putting repeaters all over the place, it’s possible to paste together a wireless network that truly works.
So, here’s the question: what happens in two years when every single device can cheaply and easily be hooked up with a pretty wide and fast connection to the Net? Brand new world, a lot faster than some people expected.","January 23, 2002","WiFi, wireless networking, technology evolution"
Opt out nationwide?,"Congress is getting closer to mandating a nationwide opt-out list that would make it a crime for a telemarketer to call you at home during dinner if you’ve taken the time to register your phone number.

Boring,"I was stranded today. I had to spend hours in Nyack, just over the border from New Jersey, so I shopped. Actually, I TRIED to shop, but I failed. I spent two hours at the mall, and it was boring.
Having done most of my shopping online lately, I’d nearly forgotten how boring it is. Every merchant alive needs to readPaco Underhill’s book, Why We Buy.

Why Do Companies Stick With Their Mistakes?,"Sorry I haven’t blogged in a while. I’ve been traveling. Which is the inspiration for this piece.
No one is perfect. And no company avoids every mistake. But why do companies make mistakes and then do nothing to get rid of them?
Let me propose five reasons:1. The people who make the policies don’t actually work in the field.2. The people in the field aren’t given the ability to influence management without appearing to be troublemakers.3. Customers aren’t encouraged to speak up, and their suggestions are ignored.4. It’s easier to make a policy than to undo it.5. Business is complicated  and unless you come up with a clever way to measure the impact of a decision, it’s often difficult to tell if it’s a good idea or not.
I thought of all of these reasons as I flew from one airport to another the last few weeks. My heart goes out to the folks working in the airline industry—they are brave and stalwart folks, and they deserve far more credit than they are getting. I also completely support our efforts to make flying safe. That said, I think the airline security issue is an amazing analogy for what’s wrong at most companies (your company?).
First, it’s obvious that most of us aren’t encouraged to speak up about security at the airport. To do so is to be a troublemaker or even unpatriotic . Just as a company can build a culture that makes it hard to criticize a decision from headquarters, it’s been made clear to us that experts are in charge and we should shut up and support any efforts to stop bad guys from flying.
But the experts aren’t in charge! Many of the decisions getting implemented are nothing but superstitions. One person decides that nail clippers are dangerous but ballpoint pens are not, and airports all over the country begin to confiscate nail clippers. There’s no system in place to measure whether or not this policy is effective, whether or not it is worth the thousand of hours and millions of dollars it costs to enforce. Without a way to measure the effect, we can be confident the policy will last a long time.
Today’s USA TODAY says that a whistleblower  is accusing the FAA of failing to follow up on security tests and ignoring bad results when they do perform tests. Has that ever happened at your company?
Because there’s no consistent measurement system, we also discover obvious discrepancies across the system. In Montrose, Colorado, your shoes are x-rayed and you need to remove a fleece sweater (IF it has a zipper). In New York, however, shoes are fine, as are sportcoats and fleeces of any kind. At one airport, the guards confiscated all Duracell batteries, but allowed much larger laptop batteries through. Why? Because of superstition. Because there was no measurement system. Because the person who invented the policy wasn’t standing there discovering whether it was working or not. It seems pretty obvious to me that if it’s important to x-ray shoes in Colorado, it’s important to do it in New York.
One last example and one suggestion. In New York, you can’t walk through security with an open bottle of Poland Spring water in your hand. You have to take a sip to prove it’s not acid or something. But why wouldn’t a bad guy just put the bottle in his carry on? I know, I’m not supposed to ask because that would be undermining the system, but come on!
And my suggestion? Here you go. Let’s put an email address on every x-ray machine in the country. Have it say, “Do you know how to make security screening better? Drop us a line!” Now, imagine hundreds of thousands of very smart businesspeople, all travelers, all security experts or consultants or whatever, constantly upgrading the system by feeding back advice, detecting errors or increasing consistency… hmmm. Imagine that both the person making the suggestion and the operator reading it would get a bonus every time a suggestion made it through and was put into action. I could send a note praising the speed, thoroughness and kindness of the woman who patted me down… or describe three ways to make the system at West Palm Beach go more smoothly. The system would evolve—fast. Hey, it might even work at your company!
So why is an obvious idea like this (evolving fast with fast feedback loops based on data) so hard to swallow? Because managers like to make decisions. Because managers like to be right. Because employees have been trained to want the manager to make the decision, and to want stability in the policies they work with.
As our world goes faster, we need to evolve faster. If we don’t, the competition will.
While we’re talking about evolution, note that Richard Pachter wrote a supernice review of my newbookin the Miami Herald today:Herald Review","February 25, 2002","company mistakes, employee feedback, management policies"
Opt In Matters (sigh),"So there it is, in the fine print at the bottom of the Cnet article about Yahoo’s new privacy policy:
Yahoo users will now automatically have their marketing preferences set to accept updates from a smattering of Yahoo’s businesses. Previously, users were offered one option to either accept or reject product notices when first registering on the site.
Users will have to click “no” to opt out of receiving e-mails from a selection of 13 Yahoo products, ranging from job listings to new media products to inclusion in Yahoo’s user surveys, among other things. The page also has an option for users to opt in to the Yahoo Delivers service, which sends product pitches from third parties.
I’ve fought this battle so many times, I’m a little weary of it, but hey, here goes:
Opt out = spam. Opt out takes advantage of laziness, inertia and infoglut to inundate people with stuff they don’t want. Opt out is no way to build a great company. If you advertise, you should never buy opt out ads. They don’t work so well… and more important, you’re going to annoy people.
I’m ashamed of this. Most online businesses have news and offers that people will willingly read. That’s the path to go down. That’s the way to build sustainable, profitable businesses. This is a mistake. It’s too bad, really.","March 30, 2002","Yahoo, opt-out, privacy policy"
My note to Senator Hollings and his colleagues,"Lately, the entertainment mega-companies appear to be having great success lobbying Congress in an effort to preserve their monopolies and their perceived right to continue minting money.
As a creator of intellectual property who has also self-published, I come at this issue from both sides, but I have been thinking and writing about this issue for years (see the reprint of my Inside article from two years ago, which follows).
The argument of the big media companies, as I understand it, goes like this:“Copyright protection gives us the right to keep anyone, at any time, from making any copies of what we make. That means that if Apple Computer makes a device (the Ipod) that can play music ripped from CDs, Apple is responsible for building unbeatable copy protection into the device to prevent consumers from stealing our music. It means that no device that copies DVDs should be permitted to be manufactured in or imported to the United States, and going one step further, it should be a violation of federal law to post a page of instructions that can teach a hacker to program his Linux box to enable him to watch a DVD he already owns.”
!gasp!
The logic presented to Congress by their lobbyists seems to take two tacks.
First, “this is our property and copying it is stealing.”
Second, “intellectual property (movies, music, books, etc.) is a precious resource of our country, a profitable export and a way that the United States continues to influence the world. If widespread copying continues, we won’t be able to make movies, we can’t afford to make CDs, the already precarious publishing industry will die.”
I have to say upfront that I believe that both arguments are utter nonsense.
First,copyright was never intended to protect the creator or distributor of intellectual property.Instead, it was designed to help CONSUMERS. Congress correctly saw that if there was very limited (in time) protection for literary works, people would be encouraged to create it. It worked. It seems as though everyone wants to be a screenwriter or a singer or an author. By limiting the time, they gave creators a small incentive, but still protected consumers from copyright monopolies. Over the last few years, those periods (thanks to lobbying by the movie industry) have gotten longer and longer. They don’t think they can live without them, and they feel quite threatened by wholesale digital copying.
We can all agree that in the short run, consumers benefit from widespread access to a huge library of work. But what happens in the long run? Will the supply dry up as the media monopolies predict?
Even with widespread and instant copying, there are countless ways for the creators of intellectual property to profit. Perhaps Universal won’t be able to make money making $100 million movies—so what? You can’t make money being a poet either.
Hollywood’s objections all center around a fundamental error. They believe that they have right to business as usual. They believe that if the ground rules of the marketplace change, it’s not fair. They somehow deserve the private planes and the wild parties and the significant profits. And they also seem to believe that if the money wasn’t as good, the supply of ideas would dry up.
Actually, what will dry up are the profits of the big entertainment companies. The supply is well assured. It’s now easier (and far cheaper) to invent/create/produce a movie or a CD or a book than it ever was before. You can record a 24 track CD in your basement. You can make the Blair Witch Project for a few hundred thousand dollars. You can write, typeset and distribute a book for free using a PDF file.
But how can you make any money?
Well, first off,I’m not sure that’s a good question.Do you really believe that if every CD in the world was instantly put into a cosmic jukebox and the artist received no money at all that there would be any shortage of music? Sure, Mick and the Stones might not be motivated to make another album, but the large number of unsigned, unpaid artists makes it pretty clear that the supply is not threatened.
In fact, though, you CAN make money. I gave Unleashing the Ideavirus away for free on the net (more than a million people have downloaded it so far) and this approach actually made me MORE money. You can visitmy ideavirus sitefor more details, but the short version is that I make money with souvenirs—with speeches, hardcover editions, foreign translations, etc. No, there’s probably no money here for a traditional publisher to make a huge profit, but so what? If the purpose of copyright is to encourage creativity, who cares about big publishers?
Radio, after all, did not hurt the record business, even though they hated it at first. The record companies also tried to shut down MTV by charging for videos, then they discovered what a powerful tool widespread distribution was.
Let’s take it a step farther. What if every DVD on the market was instantly copied? Well, movie producers would have several alternatives:
They could, for example, make movies that work beautifully in theatres and never release them on DVD. They could make theatres more fun and more attractive to a larger audience.
They could make movies that cost far less to produce, making enough profit on the people who want to buy the beautiful DVD packaging, with extras, etc.
They could start producing interactive entertainment, which would only work when the user was online and paying the studio directly.
They could put commercials in movies, but allow people to pay a fee to go online and see the commercial-free versions while connected to a server.
They could sell subscriptions, offering, say, an audience of a million people the very freshest movies—before their neighbors—for a fee.
They could make all the profit from souvenirs (live events, clothing, etc.) instead of the performance itself. Think Grateful Dead.
Regardless of which path they follow, one thing is certain—the massive marketing and distribution network they’ve built would become far less useful. What’s wrong with that?
I agree with Steve Jobs that there’s a huge, huge opportunity here. If you know WHO is listening/watching/reading and you have permission to market to them, there are countless ways to profit from that. Perhaps you don’t make as much from a given hit, but that doesn’t mean it should be forbidden by the government.
At the heart of this issue is not fairness, nor is it economics. It’s a simple plea by the entertainment giants to keep everything JUST THE WAY IT IS. Federal Express couldn’t stop email, and Fox shouldn’t be permitted to cripple several industries just to support multi-million dollar salaries.
Ideas that spread are worth more than those that don’t. Devices that spread ideas are both an important economic engine AND a huge opportunity for both cultural and economic growth.
But the most important message here is simple. Congress rarely succeeds when they use legislation to “help” an industry by forbidding changes. Let the market work.
if you know someone in Congress or the music/movie business, please go ahead and forward this blog. I hope that people will start to see the huge opportunity this technology represents…at the very least, I hope they can hear the other side of the argument.
note: When you’re working on an idea, sometimes it seems like everyone else is, too. After I wrote the first draft of this note, there were three (at least) great articles over the last week on this issue. (Kelly in the New York Times Magazine and Mossberg and Weber in the Wall Street Journal.) I don’t think any of them went far enough though… we’re still stuck in the status quo, worrying about publishers and their business model, and not dialing back to the actual creators.","March 18, 2002","Copyright, Intellectual Property, Entertainment Industry"
Almost two years ago…,"The editors at Inside.com (now, alas, basically defunct) asked me to write them a longish piece about new media, copyright and monopolies. As I was preparing to write a note to Senator Hollings about his ridiculous proposed copyright legislation, I kept coming back to the article. Here it is (I told you it was long) and I haven’t updated it or edited it. I still think the message to the media companies is right (if I didn’t, I’d hide it!).
You’re a monopolist.
Not that there’s anything wrong with that, of course.
If you’re reading this magazine, it’s likely that you’re a successful member of the profit-seeking entertainment industry. And if you’re making money in movies, books, music or TV, it’s because you can take advantage of a legacy of monopolistic (or maybe oligopolistic) practices.
Having a monopoly is fun and exciting and fraught with power. It’s also intoxicating.
How else to explain the hubris of three of Hollywood’s best and brightest launching a well-funded website that managed to go out of business before it even launched? If you’re used to being able to corner the market, it’s easy to think that another medium is just another medium.
How else to explain the exploits of the RIAA as they valiantly duel with Napster, trying to put the genie of widespread music distribution back into the bottle. They’re used to having a monopoly on the distribution of music, and they want it back.
How else to explain the antics of the book industry as they stumble their way through the minefields of Microsoft, Stephen King and free e-books? “Publishers control the distribution, not these weenies, dammit!”
It was great to be a monopolist. Steady profits and no hassles. It would be great if we could stay monopolists forever, wouldn’t it?
Before you call the Justice Department, let me explain. The limited supply of content, the few choices of distribution–these practices are all legal… most of them are actually enforced by the government. But understanding where these monopolies came from (and why they’re going away-fast(!)) will give you a new way of looking at your business, and it turns out that this sort of analysis can open amazing new markets and new ways of generating profits.
We know that if you offer a smart consumer two products that are absolutely identical (same quality, similar brand attributes, just as convenient), she’ll choose the cheaper one. Gasoline stations have price wars-but movie theatres don’t. Supermarkets lose money when they sell milk, but TV networks are dedicated to turning a profit on just about everything. The heart of the mediabusinessis the prospect of being a monopolist-of getting paid alotmore than our products cost to make.  But when the monopoly goes away, there’s not a lot of room for obscene profits. In markets where people have a choice between equals, the cheapest and most convenient often win.
Over time, the media business has done everything it can to be sure that consumersdon’thave a choice. After all, a CD increases in price about 25 times from the time it’s made to the time it’s purchased by the listener. And a TV ad that costs a network zero to broadcast might end up selling for a million dollars.
There are three things that led to the monopolies we now enjoy:1. The FCC limited the number of TV and radio stations in every market, allowing three networks to dominate TV and the record companies to dominate radio.2. Copyright ensures that we can charge a lot for a book or a record… way more than it costs to make it.3. The limited number of physical distribution outlets (record stores, movie theatres) guarantees that distributors with clout get more shelf space.
This triad is responsible for the profits you’re enjoying right now. Imagine a nightmare of a world in which all three legs on this stool disappear. At the same time.
Time to wake up. It just happened.
THE MONOPOLIES ARE DYING…AND THEY’RE GETTING DEADER
The past, the glorious, profit-making,funpast of the media business was based on:• scarce creators, under long term contracts• scarce retail outlets, able to be controlled with marketing muscle• scarce spectrum (few radio stations, few TV stations)• copyright laws (and a lack of technology) that limited theft of services• limited power of the creators to compete without a large media company as partner
It’s hard to outline a point of view that shows the power of any form of media gettingstrongerover the next decade. There are going to be more TV channels, not less. More ways for authors to distribute their works, not less. More ways for musicians to connect with listeners, not less. More ways for consumers to sample or take content, not less.
You were a monopolist. You’re not anymore.
To succeed in the old days, here’s what you needed to do (choose any two!):1. Grab a piece of the electromagnetic spectrum, hopefully one limited by the government2. Buy up the supply of actors or writers3. Establish long term profitable relationships with distributors and retail outlets
Welcome to a new century. In the new century, we all have the same goal:1. Establish a direct and positive relationship with the end user.
It sounds easy. It’s not. It’s scary. It’s likely to wreck your business before it saves it. Doesn’t matter. The truth is: businesses that don’t aggressively pursue this tactic will disappear.
Here’s what you do: Go toStickyFlicks. David Burke (a successful TV producer of animated wacko content) has assembled a few brilliant scoundrels and put up a site filled with juvenile humor (most of it in bad taste) and really neat animation. And people are flocking to his site. Not because he’s spending big money or licensing the interactive rights to Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. People are flocking because of digital word of mouth and the viral nature of the web.
How dare he! He has no big studio money. He has no relationships with CAA and he doesn’t exhibit at Cannes or NATWest. Yet he has an audience around the world. Yet he’s building characters with real value-characters that will become toys or movies or t-shirts. He has violated every single rule of the old order, and he’s still succeeding.

Sorry to remind you, but consider the Drudge Report. Four years ago, nobody had ever heard of Matt Drudge. Today, for many Americans, he’s one of their most important sources of news. He paid no dues, didn’t work his way through a corporate hierarchy, owes nothing to the head of the network.
Hardly seems fair, does it?
Last experiment. Go tolive365. They currently list more than 17,000 different radio stations. All live, right now. Big question: If one station is playing a lot of ads, how hard is it for you to find one that isn’t? If you’re a station manager used to competing against one or two stations with similar format, what happens when you have 5,000 nearly identical competitors?
Can you imagine a situation like this happening eighteen months ago?
Okay, I can’t resist. One more try. Go toGnutella. There, you’ll see the successor to Napster. This version is the one that the music industry brought upon itself by going after the original. Gnutella has no database, no offices, no centralized server of any kind. There’s no one to sue. No one to blame when greedy consumers start sharing music, images, stock photos and soon… movies.
Are all three of these examples perfect businesses, bound to bankrupt you and your peers? No way. They’re nits. Chinks in the armor. Little businesses that might get bigger. Sure, there are tons of example of well-financed new media companies that went under. That’s not the point. The point is that individuals with little or no money are building real media properties that are attracting the consumers thatyouwant to attract. There will be plenty of carnage and disappointments in this new arena. Who cares? What matters is that thereisa new arena. It’s mere presence means that the monopolies are dying.
I had coffee with the executive producer of a network news show last week. He told me that every year, in addition to getting smaller in size, his audience, on average, ages almost a year. The people he needs in order to maintain his monopoly are finding something else to do with their time.
Need more proof? Take a look at Tivo and Replay. These digital VCRs have tiny audiences (but expect a bunch to sell this Christmas). It’s easy to dismiss them as toys for the digerati. Easy, except for one fact: 80% of the people who use one of these devices skipallof the commercials during the shows they watch. ALL of them! Imagine. So much for the business model of the most powerful medium of all time.
SIDEBARThe hackers will hack.
One of the refrains we’re hearing from the lawyers who work for the RIAA is that the rule of law will be restored to the Net, that copyright can be reinstated, that they can put the genie back in the bottle. If you’ve been following the Napster debate, you may have heard the lawyers describe how they can spam the system.
Napster allows anyone to place a file (usually a song) on its database for others to share. Of course, there’s nothing to stop you from taking songs by the Captain and Tenille and label them as bootlegs of the new Rolling Stones record. Some even believe that the recording industry is encouraging this as a way to bring down Napster and even Gnutella. After all, if there’s a fifty-fifty chance you’re going to get a life insurance ad instead of Madonna, that’s enough reason to stop right there.
Well, the hackers will hack. New software is now smart enough to listen to files and match the audio “fingerprint” of the file with what itshouldbe. And delete the spam.
The point isn’t that this problem is now solved. The point is that anonymous hackers, working around the world, twenty-four-seven, are obsessed with and focused on hacking whatever needs to be hacked. This genie is not going back in the bottle.
I’m no Grateful Dead lyricist suggesting that copyright is dead. No, I dearly love my copyrights, and you should love yours. Instead, I’m boldly proposing that in the face of a worldwide assault on copyright, concocting business models that don’t rely on lawyers is an awfully smart policy. In fact, if you could be happywithoutcopyright, because you own a different, more powerful asset, you’re destined to trounce the competition if their only asset is a shaky hold on digital intellectual property.

Face it. The barriers are falling and they’re falling fast. If there are limits to how many competitors you were facing, those limits are going away. There used to be room for just a few movies to open over Labor Day. But when movies are shown on DVD players in my house and yours, there’s room for hundreds of millions of movies to open on the same day!
Think it’s easy to sell banners on the Internet? There are 40 million different sites, with more every day. How much of a premium are you, the advertiser, willing to pay for one thousand impressions onthissite instead ofthatsite? That’s why the CPM went from $100 a thousand to a buck in less than two years. What happens to the ad sales of your TV network when there are 40 million different TV networks? What happens to the budget for your new arthouse movie when there are millions of people cranking out their own arthouse movies?
You’re not going out of business tomorrow. The structures you’ve built and perfected are going to stick around for a long time. We still want blockbuster movies and the Top 40 and Tom Clancy’s next book. But it’s not going to get better, more profitable or more fun. It’s going to get worse.
As I write this, NBC has flown hundreds of its best people to Sydney. Is it possible to overpay for the Olympics? When the mass market is long gone, and network viewership is at an all time low, probably not. It’s a fun way to revisit the glory days of Ed Sullivan and Mary Tyler Moore. Alas, in the long run, the folks who run the Olympics will end up with all the money and NBC (or whatever network is dumb enough to take its place) ends up with two weeks of memories and a black hole where their wallet used to be. People are wringing their hands over NBC’s Olympic ratings. They say they’re lousy because of the time zone issue. Nonsense. They’re lousy because Americans are no longer willing to sit down for two weeks and all watch the same stuff, especially when it’s jammed with irrelevant commercials.
The alert reader now interrupts and shouts, “Wait a minute!” After all, Pop.com just went bust. Viacom spent a ton on MTVi, and look where it got them. And Warner Bros. spent years and years with an entertainment portal (lately called Entertaindom) and it tanked as well.
“We’re not against new media. We just think it’s a bit of a fraud.”
And my response is to cry foul. I spent years dealing with many of these organizations, and I was astonished and overwhelmed by the combination of old-media thinking, arrogance and lack of vision they managed to squeeze into just a few very well furnished audiences.
Compare, for example, stickyflicks with pop.com. Stickyflicks is viral. Pop.com was centrally controlled… a broadcast model. Stickyflicks has appropriate overhead (almost none). Pop.com had hundreds of people all around the world, giving up lucrative gigs in old media for lucrative gigs in new media.
Or how about Entertaindom? Busy streaming the trailers for Batman movies when they could have been building a permission asset. Busy trying to gain mindshare among their competitors when, instead, they could have been working hard to invent fundamentally different rules for the new medium.
The key, regardles of whether we’re talking wireless or the Net or even automated phone services like TellMe-it’s all exactly the same goal: Don’t bring the old monopoly-driven mindsets to the non-monopoly marketplaces! Just because you can get away with being a bully (“Do you knowwhoyou’re talking to!”) in your current job doesn’t mean that the mindset is going to fly in a world where the rules are different.
Sorry for the rant, but the new media efforts by most old-line media companies get me quite riled. Instead of using the tremendous assets and credibility they have to launch a brand new business model, they get stuck. And now it’s happening as Internet companies enter the wireless arena. They don’t call it new media for nothing!
So now, the good news:
Oprah Winfrey launched a magazine in the Spring. It has millions of readers, starting from zero. Probably profitable from day 1.
Stephen King wrote a book and more than 150,000 gladly paid him for a chance to read the first chapter.
Jimmy Buffet is one of the most successfully recording artists working today, and he rarely makes a record.
The answer to your monopoly problem is to create a new monopoly. I call it the Permission Monopoly.
Here’s how it works:
Everyone has a limited attention span. We can’t read all the books we want, listen to all the music we want, go to all the movies. So we filter. We ignore. We procrastinate. And we hide.
Have you heard the new album from Bill Frisell? ReadDescarte’s Error?Seen Croupier? Didn’t think so. No time. Of course, if someone you trusted insisted that you spend the time to try them out, you might. Of course, if they were created by people you’d liked in the past, you’d be more likely to try them out. If you could try them out for free, you’d be more likely to try them out as well.
In the past, Tower Records or The Tattered Cover or WNEW or General Cinema was appointed (by default) as the arbiter of what we’d pay attention to. If it got played on the radio, we heard it. If it was by the cash register, we saw it. If Brandon Tartikoff liked it, we watched it.
In today’s million channel universe, though, those arbiters are a lot less powerful. Now, maybe I want Slate to recommend it. Now, maybe the programmer of my internet radio station has to cue it up.
So, without powerful arbiters, it’s way harder for powerful media companies to modify the marketing conversation. Way harder for ten well-funded salespeople to get shelf space everywhere that matters. Way harder for a crack PR person to get you a review in just the right publication.
What’s a megalomaniac media mogul to do?
The wrong strategy, it seems to me, is to go court and try to stop the leaky bucket. It also seems like a mistake to call the authors and filmmakers and others who abandon you, “crazy” or “short-term focused” or to say, “well, they can get away with that but the others can’t.”
The defectors know something you don’t. The defectors know that if they hurry, they can build a new monopoly, a monopoly you don’t control. They know that they can build a direct and long-term relationship with the end user, one that will survive competitive incursions and will last a long time.ifthey hurry.
And so, learn from these folks.youshould hurry. Youmusthurry. If you understand that the game is radically and permanently being changed, you can go out today and start building mutually beneficial relationships with your listeners/readers/watchers. You can offer these folks something of value in exchange for their attention. You can then build a new monopoly.
Imagine trying to get Bill Clinton to allow you to publish his new autobiography. What happens when you can say, “We have a permission-based relationship with 32 million Americans, all of whom look forward to hearing from us every two weeks with our hot new book offerings. And by the way, our competition doesn’t even have 10 names.”
What happens when you’re trying to break a great new trance band, and you have permission to send the first single, by e-mail, to 600,000 kids who loved the last trance band you broke? Think that helps your career?
PLEASE NOTE: I’m talking about treating consumers the way you and other marketers have been treating them for a century. No churn and burn. No contemptuous, “we’ll talk to you when we want to, otherwise keep quiet!” And no renting, buying or selling lists. No, I’m talking about treating this new client the same way you treat your most important retail account or radio station or theater owner. You don’t show up at his house in the middle of the night (or if you do, you bring a big box of cubans). You don’t send them e-mail spam, or call them on the phone over and over again.
You have a relationship. You understand that every interaction has to benefit BOTH of you or the relationship is over. If you’re going to build a monopoly on consumer attention, you’ll need to do the same thing.
Here’s how I boil it down to as few words as possible:1. Make it easy for your happy users to tell as many of their friends as possible.2. Give away free samples early and often.3. Get permission from anyone who likes what you do to follow up with anticipated, personal and relevant messages that benefit both of you.4. If this requires changing what you make and what you charge for, fine.5. If steps 1,2, 3 and 4 mess up your current business model, fine.
You’ll notice that the one form of media I haven’t talked about very much is magazines. Why’s that? Because magazines already get it. They know that a magazine without subscribers is bankrupt. They know that newsstand sales are fine, but subscriptions pay the bills. Editors of magazines have a great time, because they spend all their time finding writers for their readers. Everyone else in media spends their time finding readers for their writers! And when you farm instead of hunt, when you obsess over satisfying happy and loyal customers, your business is more profitable and more stable. You’re a satisfied monopolist. Someone call Joel Klein!
The new monopoly of the future is permission. Permission to talk to your customers directly about new stuff. Permission to teach, permission to ask, permission to learn. If you have that monopoly, you profit over and over and over again.Permission Marketing
SIDEBARThe Napster Debacle
A lot has been written about Napster, and most of it seems to say, “hey, we know it’s against the law to copy stuff wholesale, but the record companies better get used to it, because it’s not going to go away.” This may, in fact, be true, but I think it’s more interesting to come at it a different way: The record companies shouldwantthis to happen!
A long time ago, radio was a threat to the recorded music business. The logic was that once people had a radio-and could hear the music for free-they’d stop buying records. Obviously, this wasn’t true. A few decades later, the record business was so obsessed with radio airplay that they actually startedpayingradio stations to play their music for free.
When MTV came along, the same cycle repeated itself. The labels were aghast that they were expected topayto make expensive videos, which MTV then got to play for free. Wrong again, they learned their lesson and now compete heavily for airplay.
Napster offers yet another sampling mechanism. Yet another chance to spread the music. This time, though, it takes advantage of peer networks. It isn’t the Program Director who gets to decide what’s going to be a hit. It’s the kids. They’ll spread it from person to person if it’s good, regardless of how much or how little promotion is behind it.
What a boon for musicians! What a headache for the labels. Problem number one is that money (and a navel-exposing video) is going to be a tricky substitute for a great riff or intense lyrics. You can’t buy your way to success on a peer network. Problem number two is that once the fidelity and user interface get a little better, the computer will probably eliminate the need for a compact disc player!
Now, if you’re a record label and you realize that 90% of your income comes from selling polycarbonate discs in jewel boxes, you better be pretty nervous about a future where I don’t need to pay money to buy your plastic.
But instead of fighting this sampling device (the way you’ve fought every other sampling device), maybe it’s a way to redefine your business so that you make more money and have more fun.
What happens if you cut a deal with Napster that makes it easy for listeners to subscribe to groups they like. To create a communication bridge between users and musicians (and their label.)
Here’s a bridge that’s never existed before. Now, suddenly, you know everyone who loved Rickie Lee Jones’ new album, AND you have permission to contact them. What’s that worth?
Well, let’s see:• You can sell way more copies of her next album (assuming people are still buying CDs). Drop a note to all her fans with a link to Amazon in it andbambestseller status in one day.• You can sell digital versions of new songs to people who want to hear them first. No need to wait for albums any more. Rickie Lee Jones says, “If I can find 50,000 fans willing to pay me $10 to go to the recording studio and do an album with Willie Nelson, I’m in.” Now, the listeners can choose to pay, to get first dibs on the new record.• You can sell t-shirts and other souvenirs (don’t smirk. My $40 book was a souvenir of the digital version, and it sells just fine!)• You can alert people (by zip code) of when Rickie Lee Jones will be in their town. Imagine being able to tell the 97,000 Rickie Lee Jones fans in the New York area that Rickie’s coming to do a gig at Roseland. Think it will be hard to sell 3,000 tickets?• You can start custom digital radio stations that play new and unique music from artists I’m sure to like. Suddenly, instead of finding listeners for your label’s music, you’re busy finding music for your labels listeners!
Is this going to be as certain and as comfortable and as predictable a business as you have now? No way. But your monopoly is gone, my friend, and it seems like you have two choices-be the first to embrace the new monopoly (permission to talk to fans) or lose.
Think about the dynamic from the musician’s point of view. Wealthy, successful musicians (your bread and butter) have an incentive to be like the Grateful Dead, to put their music out to ever more people (stokes their ego) and to profit from backlist or tours or souvenirs or incremental record sales. Not all of them will do this, of course, but do you even want to lose a few?
At the same time, the great unwashed, the unsigned bands, have nothing at all to lose! They can build a real following, generate listeners and audiences just by using these new sampling techniques. Then, when they’re hot, some of them will sell out and sign a deal with you. But soon, many will realize that they’ll make more money and have more fun just hiring a firm that helps them do that.
And once these new bands have a monopoly on the attention and permission of their fans, they can leverage that monopoly over and over again. They can use to introduce new songs or new records or new tours. Or-sit down for this one-they can use it to introduce new bands!
The power is certainly moving. It’s moving from five oligopolistic status quo gatekeepers that controlled money and promotion and retail to a much messier, faster-moving, more interesting amalgamation of database keepers, musicians and fans. Today, there’s a chance to co-op parts of that system. Tomorrow, that chance will be gone.",,"Monopolies, New Media, Permission Marketing"
Unreal estate?,"I think we can all agree that private property is a pretty good idea. We don’t want anyone who feels like it sleeping on our back porch, raiding the fridge or ‘borrowing’ our car.
Lately, though, folks who make intellectual property, the “unreal” stuff that you can’t touch as much as you can watch or listen to, have moved to make it much more like the physical goods we all own.
Much of the discussion has been incremental: Should you be allowed to watch a DVD movie on your linux machine? Should Amazon be allowed to sell used books right next to the new ones? Should it be against the law to publish five lines of original computer code on your web site?

Proof that the media assault is ubiquitous,"Working out at the awful Marriott outside of the Minneapolis airport yesterday. Blissfully empty, I turned off the two TV sets (different channels, both blaring) and started my workout.
Fifteen minutes into it, a silver-haired executive-looking (how you do that in a t-shirt is anybody’s guess) guy walks in, walks right by me, reaches up and turns on CNN before he gets on the treadmill.
Try to imagine the opposite occurring. You walk in while someone is watching CNN and turn it off without asking. Never happen.
It’s clear to me that the media onslaught is the default. We’re so used to having the white noise of TV and the web that not only can’t we live without it, we assume no one else can either. What’s also clear is nobody really WATCHES it anymore (especially the commercials.) It’s just there.
I remember how special a TV show (any TV show) was in 1966 when I first started watching TV seriously. How everyone remembered every commercial and we all watched the same shows. I still remember some Batman episodes like they were yesterday… but I have no idea what CNN broadcast yesterday in the gym.

A giant step (backward),"Today’s Wall Street Journal features an article by Stacy Forster about marketers trying to “polish spam’s rusty image.”
I’m just astonished by the naivete of the article, and scared that it will send the wrong message to honest marketers.
She writes, “legitimate businesses that look to e-mail as an effective marketing tool…” without realizing that NO legitimate business uses spam as a tool for long. It doesn’t matter if you’re selling diamond mines, weight loss tools, penis surgery or refrigerator dehumidifiers–spam is going to take your brand down.
How? By creating brand rage (not brand equity) in the 99.9% of the people who don’t respond. For every order you manage to coerce out of someone, you’re burning your brand with 100 others.
The article is filled with bad analysis and shady anecdotes from everyone except Jason Catlett ofJunkbusterswho understands that spam is like shoplifting.
Like shoplifting? Yep. If you steal a $20 item from Macy’s, it’s not going to bankrupt them. But if 1,000 or 10,000 people did that every day, it would bring the store to its knees. One or two or even ten pieces of spam a day don’t ruin someone’s email account.. but 1,000 will. If spam’s image gets polished, and it is virtually free, why shouldn’t we expect that will happen? We need to do everything we can to keep spam’s image not just rusty, but toxic.
Consumers see spam as a sign of disrespect and dishonesty. It’s not about privacy–it’s about taking something from me (my attention, my time) without costing your company a cent.
If you are a marketer, just stop. If you’re a consumer and you get spam from a “legitimate” company, call them up and let them know how angry you are.
I’ve said it before and I’m saying it again–if you have to start weaseling your way through the fine print of the privacy policy, or justifying your spam in any way, you’re jeopardizing your brand and your business. You can do better.","May 22, 2002","spam, marketing, brand integrity"
Getting from here to there…,"I saw a bumper sticker that I really liked. It said, “Is it transportation or a lifestyle?” Of course, you never see a bumper sticker like that on a Mercedes. It was on a beater of a Subaru, naturally.
Then I noticed that the Wall Street Journal is now running a regular feature on which celebrities and industry luminaries are buying which cars… and in which cities.
It’s a little odd, if you think about it. Here’s one of the biggest purchases the average person makes, and we’re interested in what famous people are endorsing our decision.
But then the real question hit me. The car dominates our culture. It has a huge impact on our cities, on our balance of trade, on the environment and world politics. If everyone gave up SUVs and drove a hybrid, we’d essentially be independent of foreign oil and the threat to the atmosphere would virtually disappear (as would asthma, smog, etc.). But almost no one is suggesting this as a potential solution.
Why? Because somehow, we’ve marketed ourselves this formula: cars=self-esteem.
I mean, I love my Miata. I drive it with a smile on my face, and I like to believe that I really drive it the way it was designed to be driven. Of course, SUV users like to justify their purchase in exactly the same way I do. Why do we care so much about what we drive? I certainly don’t give the same thought to my shoes or kind of pen I use. What would happen if there were no choice in car (except the paint job)?
Imagine for a second that all the time and money and competitive drive we put into buying, cleaning, improving, tuning and tweaking our cars needed to be spent in other ways.
What if you could get a big car (a slow van) or a little car (a slightly less slow sedan) and that was it? In our post-industrial age, would this radical government intervention grind capitalism to a halt?
In the name of national security, world peace and environmental longevity, it’s an interesting thought exercise, isn’t it?
From a marketing point of view, the discussion is even more interesting. When you take away an expensive option of expressing self-esteem (cars, say), human beings quickly find substitutes. It might be Timberland boots downtown, or Prada bags uptown. Both are ridiculously overpriced for the utility they deliver, but it’s the brand that matters, the label, the image, the peace of mind.
How do some marketers create this while others fail?
I think when traditional marketers talk about “brand”, this is what they mean. A true brand is something where the self-esteem value far exceeds the utlity. It might be Heinz ketchup or a Rolex watch or a  Marlboro cigarette, but in each case there’s a truly emotional connection between the brand and the user.
Alas, almost all marketers fail utterly in creating a brand. The allure of a powerful brand (Disney) appears to keep the non-winners (Six Flags) plugging away.
I’m way off the topic of cars here, but I’m really not. What I’m worried about now are side effects–the unintended consequences of excellent branding. I’m not in favor of the government getting in the middle of this, but I sure wish I could figure out how to market our way out of this problem. It’s one of the great tragedies of our profession, imho.","May 16, 2002","Transportation, Branding, Self-esteem"

Robert Heinlein said…,"“There has grown in the minds of certain groups in this country the idea that just because a man or corporation has made a profit out of the public for a number of years, the government and the courts are charged with guaranteeing such a profit in the future, even in the face of changing circumstances and contrary to public interest. This strange doctrine is supported by neither statute or common law. Neither corporations or individuals have the right to come into court and ask that the clock of historybe stopped, or turned back.”

Stopping spam (in our lifetime),"In a turnabout, the Wall Street Journal today decided that spam *is* a problem, and outlines the way a few companies are trying to put together systems to stop it. I’m up to about 100 a day, so it’s certainly not going away.
But maybe there’s a different way to think about the problem. Legislation, as we all know, is a double-edged sword, and clever server-based solutions seem to be porous to ever more clever spammers.
What if AOL, Hotmail, Yahoo and MSN got together and announced the following policy:
We are now charging one-tenth of a cent for every incoming email we handle and deliver to our users.Every sender is entitled to $2 a month in free email (which means an individual address can send 2,000 emails to various Yahoo accounts, for example, every month before it costs anything).If you send more than your quota to our users, we start charging you. If you don’t have an account with cash in it set up with us, we bounce the rest of the email you send us. (yes, the spammers could start using lots of accounts, but it could move to a domain-based system instead of individual accounts).
What do these services get? Well, they cut down the spam received by 90% right off the bat.Second, they make a bit of money on the legitimate newsletters and such.
What do users get? Less spam.
And what about the legitimate services? Well, if they are sending users an email every day, that’s 36 cents a year. If the email they send is worth less than that to either side, they probably shouldn’t send it.
By monetizing email, these big services create the friction that’s currently missing from spam. Without friction, it spirals out of control. With friction, on the other hand, mass mailers make intelligent decisions about what’s worth sending and what’s not.

A big smile from CD Baby,"So, at the risk of boring you, I thought you’d like to read the confirmation note I got from my order from CD Baby (see below) today. A far cry from Amazon’s boring confirmation (do you EVER read yours?)
A little creativity can build your brand in a big way:
Your CDs have been gently taken from our CD Baby shelves withsterilized contamination-free gloves and placed onto a satin pillow.
A team of 50 employees inspected your CDs and polished them to makesure they were in the best possible condition before mailing.
Our packing specialist from Japan lit a candle and a hush fell over thecrowd as he put your CDs into the finest gold-lined box that money canbuy.
We all had a wonderful celebration afterwards and the whole partymarched down the street to the post office where the entire town of Portlandwaved ‘Bon Voyage!’ to your package, on its way to you, in our privateCD Baby jet on this day, Tuesday, June 18th.
I hope you had a wonderful time shopping at CD Baby.  We sure did.Your picture is on our wall as “Customer of the Year”.  We’re allexhausted but can’t wait for you to come back to CDBABY.COM!!",,"CD Baby, customer experience, creativity"
Adventures in the Music Business (part 2),"(part 1 is below this… go figure.)
This is a love letter toCD Baby.
They list more than 20,000 independent CDs, they sort them beautifully, they’re priced great, it’s just about the only place to find stuff like this, the customer service is amazing and the site is a textbook case of good design.
But that’s not why I’m writing about them.
If you clickhereyou can see CD Baby from the independent musician’s point of view. You pay $35. Send them five copies of your CD. They warehouse it, build the page, create the digital mp3 samples and you’re good to go. And then they pay you every week when your stuff sells. They never delist anyone (why bother, it’s the web.)
To date, CD Baby has sold about a quarter of a million copies of their disks and paid, on average, about $6 a title back to the artists. This is approximately 6,000 times as much per record as the typical artist makes when they work with a label (until they become the Rolling Stones, but that’s a different story).
CD Baby doesn’t care WHICH independent artists succeed. They’re just betting that independent artists WILL succeed.
So the math is this: 20,000 plus musicians create homemade CDs (or invest the money to do it in a studio with all the talent they can afford). They burn them themselves, or even better, visitthe world’s best CD duplicating serviceand send em off to CD Baby. Then, they promote like crazy, sending their local fans to CD Baby, where, in addition to buying that album, they buy this album and those albums and on and on.
When everyone buys their music online (and if they buy it anywhere, isn’t that where they’ll buy it?) what purpose do traditional record labels serve?
Sure, that’s an overstatement. There will always be hits. We’ll always buy Britney Spears or whoever takes her place. But as the marketplace continues to nichify (is that a word?), as radio stations continue to have less influence, as Morpheus makes it easy to preview whatever you like–we can become our own editors. If the newMartha’s TroubleCD sounds just as good as the well-produced Shawn Colvin album you love, why isn’t this a better process?","June 18, 2002","CD Baby, independent artists, music distribution"

The key is that the offers have to be both relevant and honest. It’s not an offer if it’s not a lot of money saved. If it’s for something I’m not interested in, it’s a waste. If it’s just promotional hoopla, it’s not going to work. Instead, it needs to be special.
The cool thing is that once this works (and I think it will) then manufacturers ought to be willing to pay a bunch to participate. And my guess is that Amazon will be likely to pass on some of the money to us, the incessant consumer.

Slashdot and NPR,"I hate pledge week on National Public Radio. It bothers me that the otherwise intelligent people who run the station believe that they can hold the station hostage while we “buy back” our right to listen. I mean… I ‘ve got plenty of other things to do in the car. I can listen to “Waiting for Godiva” from the new band Sauce (more on this in a few weeks) or even, heaven forfend, switch to another non-commercial radio station. I need a pretty exceptional reason to listen to commercial radio (notice they put the word “commercial” before the word “radio”)
Anyway, as much as I hate pledge week, I’m wondering if there’s something to it.
The problem with the NPR model is that they don’t have a way of discontinuing their broadcast to someone who doesn’t pledge. In other words, there’s no way to turn you off if you don’t pay.
Online, we all know that banner ads are virtually worthless (and they sell for as little as a tenth of a penny per banner) and now the sites we use are upping the ante in order to make a living. They’re working to interrupt us with pop-ups, pop-unders and various other distractions. Of course, they need to (and deserve to) make a profit, so more power to them.
The thing is, it’s still not very profitable for them. They realize that they can’t TOTALLY hold us hostage with various advertising come ons, or we’ll switch to another site. In their perfect world, the media company would have no competition and we’d have to watch several full page ads (just like TV or radio) before we could get back to our regular programming.
It’s not, however, a perfect world, and as a result, the media companies make little or nothing on every single visit we make to their sites…but we, the users, are annoyed nonetheless.
So, what if, what if, just maybe, we learned a quick lesson from NPR… but without the free rider problem.
Slashdot.org is now offering a service where you get no ads for about $5 a month.
Yahoo sees more than a 100 million users a month. Can you imagine how profitable they’d be if we all just paid them $5 and never again had to see the Classmates ad? Never had to “close window” in order to get back to our e-mail…

Subscribers to the Ideavirus newsletter will be familiar withA Worthy Cause, the zero-profit online fundraiser I helped a few friends launch last year. After our beta test, we learned a lot and we’re back again, this time raising money for Juvenile Diabetes.
The goal is simple: find people who don’t ordinarily donate to charity and give them a massive reason to give $10–a contest where the best fundraiser wins $5,000.
It’s very politically correct… every single penny except for credit card fees goes straight to JDRF, so it’s incredibly efficient. AND, if you win, you can always donate your prize, too!
It’s worth a look (that address again:A Worthy Cause) because you can see how an ideavirus for a good cause might get built. I hope that you’ll start a team.

Are You a Criminal?,"Jack Valenti wants to make you one.
There’s a long history (as my readers know) of oligopolies trying to use Congress to legislate against technology. It’s easiest to see how pervasive this is by looking at Federal Express, a notable exception to the rule. The fax machine took a huge chunk out of their business (followed by email) but they resisted the urge to get some powerful senator from Tennessee to pass a law stating that faxes should be taxed, regulated or banned. After all, think of all the American jobs that would be lost to this infernal hardware device!
The movie industry doesn’t have the guts Fedex did. The movie industry is charming, swarming, intimidating and leveraging every member of Congress to get them to criminalize the Internet. They have a three step argument:1. We need digital broadband to the home to reach both educational nirvana and remain competitive worldwide.2. There will be no digital broadband until Hollywood starts  releasing movies in this format.3. Hollywood won’t do this because of piracy! Look what happened to the poor shnooks in the record business….
In my previous note on Senator Hollings ill-thought-out bill on this issue, I pointed out that in our democracy, the point of the laws should be to protect all of us, not just a chosen few who happen to have an existing business (one that may or may not co-exist with new technologies).
Valenti’s arguments are nonsense. First, there are plenty of reasons we don’t have broadband everywhere, but being able to watch Rocky digitally is not in the top five. Second, the record business started breaking when the baby boomers hit 30. The introduction of the CD masked the problem, but it certainly wasn’t napster that did em in.
According to today’sNew York Times,Valenti & Co. are making headway with a number of bills that have buried deep within them the means to allow Hollywood to criminalize many research and Internet activities. As I see it, there are a few perfectly simple concepts at work here:
1. It’s completely unproven that digital duplication of intellectual property decreases sales. In fact, as I demonstrated inUnleashing the Ideavirusit actually INCREASES sales.
2. It’s a fallacy that the government should make it a priority to protect companies that use public spectrum or the public copyright laws. They exist for the user, not for the corporations.
3. Criminalizing the Internet breaks it. In the long run, connecting people is far more valuable than making Spiderman VII possible.
4. Involving the government in enforcing these regulations distracts them from their real work and clogs the courts.
We need to expose these issues to a large number of voters. Congress will respond if they hear from us. Can you imagine Chuck Schumer or Dick Gephardt standing up at a big rally and claiming that they deserve to be reelected because they made it impossible/illegal to put a snippet of Star Wars into a Powerpoint presentation? Bragging about how they’ve filled the prisons with nerds who had the audacity to run an internet server without Jack’s approval?

The opposite of “remarkable:”,"is
very good.
Ideas that are remarkable are much more likely to spread than ideas that aren’t. Yet so few people make remarkable stuff. Why? I think it’s because they think the opposite of remarkable is bad or mediocre or poorly done. Thus, if they make something very good, they confuse it with being virus-worthy. Yet this is not a discussion about quality at all.
If you travel on an airline and they do everything right, you don’t tell anyone. That’s what’s supposed to happen. What makes it remarkable is if it’s horrible beyond belief OR if the service is so unexpected (they were an hour early! they comped my ticket because I was cute! they served flaming crepes suzette in first class!) that you need to share it.

The End of Spam?,"For years, I’ve been predicting (fairly optimistically, it turns out) that there was a technology solution to spam, and when it got bad enough, we’d find it. It turns out that we need more than just a passive filtering system, though. We need to change the whole idea of email.
Email in its classic form is a public and open inbox, available to all at no charge. That’s busted.
The idea of charging for email is a simple and workable solution, but most players don’t have the guts to take the first step.
The new idea, though, is probably going to work. Close the open inbox.
Only let people with permission (don’t you love that term? I do.) into the box. If someone wants to write to you and they don’t have permission, the program hits them with an autoreply that tells them how to get permission. Spammers, of course, won’t be able to get permission and thus they disappear. You never see the program haggling with the stranger, you just see the requests for permission. You save hours a day.
There are plenty of new products coming out that use this method (most of them buggy and still not quite ready) but as they work out some business models, I wouldn’t be surprised to see it work. I hope it does!",,"Spam, Email, Permission"
How much does style cost?,"I spent last weekend in the vast cultural wasteland that is known as Hershey, Pennsylvania.
This is the epicenter of cheap chocolate. More than that, though, it demonstrates a really important principle about design, style and the quest for the remarkable.
Hershey Park is roller coaster heaven. There are wood coasters, metal coasters, coasters that get you soaking wet and coasters for kids. If the point of an amusement park is to offer lots and lots of rides, Hershey Park has it nailed.
But spending even an hour at the park is fatiguing. It’s not just boring, it’s actually demoralizing. Part of this is due to the huge crowds, but hey, it’s a business and they make their money selling tickets, so they’re entitled…
More than ten  years ago, Philip Crosby changed the world of manufacturing with his provocatively titled book,“Quality is Free”. The thesis of the book was that it’s actually CHEAPER to make stuff right the first time than it is to fix them later.
In other words, you can make a profit by making your product better. While this seems to be commonsense today, it sure wasn’t then. We were manufacturing junk, because it was fast and we thought it was cheap. The Japanese taught us that it was even cheaper to make stuff that worked.
Well, here’s the corrollary: STYLE IS FREE.
Let me give you some examples from Hershey Park:
Every ride has a few signs you’re expected to read before you get on. The signs are a necessary expense, but that doesn’t explain why they are so ugly. For example, every sign about safety is WRITTEN IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS, WITH TIGHT LINE SPACING AND A UNATTRACTIVE, HARD TO READ FONT. Other signs are in gold, in green, in black. Every sign, just about, is different from every other.
The cost of making each sign attractive is precisely zero. Same amount of ink, same amount of wood. Yet if more people read the signs, injuries would decrease, lines would move faster and Hershey would make more money.
While we’re on the topic of signs, I did a count, and there are (this is true, you can check it out) more than 100 different typefaces used on official park signage. Standing on one spot in “Mining Town”, I saw more than 40.
It’s like there was a horrible accident at the type foundry down the road. Imagine reading a book or driving on a highway or operating a car that had more than 40 typefaces displayed simultaneously.
This decentralized, disrespectful method of communication quickly turns into NO communication.
The same sloppiness extends to the choice of foods served, the menu designs, the costumes worn by employees… on and on.
My favorite (hmmm, maybe not favorite) moment came just before we crawled away, defeated. In the midst of all the chaos, a six piece brass band (including a small tuba (a baritone) walked by, playing the theme from Hawaii Five O.
Why one brass band? Why here? Why Hawaii Five O? I have no idea.
In an earlier riff, I talked about my take on “Remarkable.” Remarkable is necessary to market today, because unremarkable products don’t get talked about, they just fade away. And the opposite of remarkable is “very good.”
Trying hard doesn’t make you remarkable. Doing a good job doesn’t make you remarkable. What makes you remarkable is being amazing, outstanding, surprising, elegant and noteworthy.
Hershey is actively spending money (million dollar rides and brass bands) trying to be remarkable, and they are barely ending up as very good.
There is no style at Hershey. It’s not that it’s BAD–there are plenty of examples of bad design that ended up being so distinctive it became good (McDonald’s, for example). No, it’s that they are lazy, or bureaucratic, or stuck. Hershey doesn’t feel like Disney. You won’t remember it after you leave. You won’t talk about it. You couldn’t describe most of the experience even if you tried. There’s no parallel construction to give you a mental map of what you just saw. No hierarchy of what’s important and what’s not. Nothing to look at when you’re not rocketing at a hundred miles an hour.
The funny thing is that this thinking is consistent. The hotel is just as ungupaatch (what a great yiddish word! It means all mixed up with no redeeming value) as the park. And the candy the company makes is boring, non-remarkable and distinctly unstylish. Compare this to the fictional Willie Wonka or the very realScharffen Bergercompany.
Does Hershey make money? Sure they do. They’re still profiting from great timing in being first with a mass market chocolate bar at precisely the right moment, and profiting further from running TV ads back when TV ads actually worked. But both those moments are long gone, and it’s a downhill ride from here.
So what’s the lesson? If you run a website, does it look like Hershey Park? If you have a retail establishment or any sort of consumer experience, is it as deadening and boring as Hershey Park?
TheApple Storeis the un-Hershey. Here’s a company with so much style, it occasionally gets in the way. But not at the store. At the store, you can grab any three square feet and use them as the DNA to make an entirely new store–and it would be consistent with the original. Just a glance at the store and you know where you are and what it means.
So what? I’ll tell you what. According to Steve Jobs, a huge percentage of visitors to an Apple store don’t own a Mac before they walk in… and do when they leave. The store isn’t just a place to exchange cash for computers… it’s a place to create a genuine emotional branding experience, one that lasts. It’s so cool, people come back with their friends.
Is the design, the lighting, the carpeting choice, the layout–all that stuff–expensive? Nope, it’s free. They had to carpet and build out the store anyway, and the cost is in the thinking and the guts, not necessarily in the fixtures themselves.
Try to imagine Hershey creating actual impact and nostalgia for their brand with Hershey Park. They may have saved a few minutes building the thing, but the complete lack of creativity, magic, imagination or excitment can’t help but bring the brand further down.
Disneyworld may not be your favorite place in the world (me either) but one incredible statistic tells the tale. Every year, more than 20,000 brides choose to have their wedding there.

"Well, almost what I would have done…","Bon Jovi, known more for loud music than acute marketing sense, is profiled in a recent Wall Street Journal piece,Battling Music Pirates.At first glance, it’s straight out of Permission Marketing. The band is offering listeners who buy a copy of their new CD a chance to enter their serial number online and get concert tickets, fan info, etc.
The good news is that the music business is starting to see that the relationship with the fan is worth more than the profit on a single CD. Last year, for the first time in more than five years, no record in the US sold more than 5 million copies. That means that reliably reaching a small audience who WANTS to hear from you is a far better strategy than attempting to sell everyone in the world.
The bad news is that the band is “battling.” That it views fans as the enemy. Why should I go to the site and register my email address and a lot of personal information? What’s in it for me? Is the access to tickets just bait, or is it really a reward for my long-term attention and cash?
Here’s the challenge–we need to remember who we’re working for. We’re working for the people who pay us (with attention.) Bon Jovi is making a really brave first step. But they have to take their time. Not get greedy. Not start spamming those fans who take a step and enroll.","September 17, 2002","Bon Jovi, music marketing, fan engagement"

Sometimes it feels like…,"…the rank and file gets nothing but the short end of whatever stick is available. Whether it’s layoffs or excessive CEO pay, the hardworking folks that really do the work end up with the shaft.
I had lunch last week with my old friend Jim. I hadn’t seen him in two years, and it was a great chance to catch up. The food was great. The rest of lunch was pretty dismal.
Jim works for a big New York conglomerate. He’s 50 years old. Got another 25 years of good work left. And he hates his job. He’s stuck. He’s doing exactly what he was doing the last time we had lunch. He spends most days counting how long before he can afford to retire—a number that, thanks to the stock market meltdown, just got a lot bigger.
Five years ago, Jim had a dream job, the sort we all envied, the kind we saw profiled in one magazine after another. Now, that very same job feels like a trap.
The big lie of the new economy is that everyone could live the life of an entrepreneur without actually being one.
We bought the idea that all the good stuff that people look for from an organization—job security, benefits, vacations, the safety of being able to blame your boss when things don’t go well—could be accompanied by the rush of fast growth and the heady feeling we get when the bureaucracy gets out of the way and we get to discover what we can really accomplish.
We lionized the 28-year-olds who were pioneering new products or launching new divisions. We envied the lucky (but not particularly skilled or risk-taking) middle managers who made a fortune with stock options. We called ourselves intrepreneurs, smiling because we were getting the best of both worlds.
Wrong. Very wrong. Wrong because we missed two big ideas.
The first idea is that big companies are fundamentally broken. Big companies are big companies because they’re very good at doing yesterday’s business. They can make (and sell) their stuff faster and cheaper than the competition because they’ve gotten good at making and selling their existing products.
The problem is that when the world changes (and it is changing faster than ever) being good at yesterday’s business isn’t just useless, it’s a liability. All those big companies are sweating now, because the infrastructure they built is about as useful as the Maginot Line—it’s obsolete. Penguins like cold weather. When it gets warm, they’re stuck. The finely tuned machinery they developed for one environment won’t work so well in a new environment.
The second idea is that the stock market has been broken for just as long. The stock market is a huge mass-psychology scam, dependent on the fiction that there will always be someone stupider than you, willing to buy those shares for more than you just paid.
A key part of this scam is the generally agreed upon principles that investors seek. At the center of those principles is the idea that big companies with predictable earnings are likely to continue to grow and thrive. This used to be true, of course, but in a chaotic world, it’s proven wrong every single day.
The bottoming out that we’re living through is a direct consequence of these two ideas becoming very clear to us at precisely the same time. Big companies can’t keep growing forever at 20% a year perfecting yesterday’s business, but the stock market didn’t want to hear about that. So the big companies, with the direct encouragement of the accounting firms, lied about their results (yeah, lied is a strong word, but that’s what it’s called when you don’t tell the truth).
All along, while we were giddy at the huge expansion we all enjoyed, we were missing the real point. And now we’re paying for it.
The other day, I took my son to see Steve Jobs give his annual keynote at the MacWorld Expo in New York. He sat transfixed for hours, amazed at the energy and insight and enthusiasm Steve brought to the podium. I mean, Steve was acting like he owned the place.
Of course, he does own the place. And that’s the most important lesson I think we can take away from the nausea of the last two years.
Apple introduces great products on a regular schedule. Contrast the magic of the iPod or dot Mac or Final Cut Pro with the sheer banality of most of what passes for innovation in big business. Other technology companies introduce services they expect to become profitable monopolies. Apple introduces things they’re proud of.
Steve isn’t trying to make the stock price go up. He’s not trying to keep his current infrastructure busy or please his dealers. He’s making stuff he believes in. He’s continuing the legend. It’s the happy coincidence of his ego and our needs.
Of course, that’s only true when it’s true. The rest of the time, Apple makes products that fail, that don’t excite, that don’t make a profit. For almost thirty years, though, there have been just enough wins to pay for the losses. He’s a hero. A model for millions.
What if everyone had guts like that? What if everyone reading this article realized that the point of our careers (2,000 hours a year, 50 years in a row, that’s 100,000 hours of work) isn’t to crank out yet another widget? What if, just maybe, we quit making stuff and started making a difference?
The giant secret of the new economy was this: entrepreneurs momentarily got a free (and fast) ride to wealth via the stock market. That connection is temporarily over, but the basic idea behind entrepreneurship is stronger than ever. In a time of rapid change, the best organizations are small and fast, and the people who run them have a chance to make an impact that will last.
It’s not a coincidence that one of the byproducts of the technology revolution is the death of the factory. With all the publicly available infrastructure (from cell phones to email to Kinkos to outsourcing in Thailand) there’s really no reason at all to build a big company any more. And since big companies are no more profitable than little ones, it’s the little ones that are most likely to spring up, make a difference and then (without tears) disappear, only to reappear some other time, some other place.
This is hard to swallow for a lot of people. We grew up with parents who read Time or Forbes, not Inc. Our role models weren’t crazed entrepreneurs, on a mission from god to accomplish something or go bust trying. We don’t see ourselves wearing those shoes. Why can’t the world just settle down and let us get some rest?
Alas, the world isn’t going to settle down. The desire for safety is understandable, but it’s being overwhelmed by Moore’s Law, by globalization, by competitive desire. I’m sorry if you’ve made it two-thirds of the way to retirement, but, alas, the world got crazy on us.
The dot coms that failed in a big way all had one thing in common—they tried to use money to insulate themselves from external change. They tried to buy success, to buy bigness, to buy stability. You can’t, no matter how big you are.
As long as you work for someone, you have no job security. As long as your company is public, your future is in the hands of others—people who are likely not as smart as you are. And as long as you follow the instructions of others, you won’t be fulfilling your destiny of really and truly making a difference in the way people live and work.
How much time do you spend every day worrying about how fulfilled and happy the CEO is? How much do you invest to be sure she’s got a secure job? Big news: your CEO spends precisely the same amount of time worrying about you.
I want you to do something for you. I’m begging you. It’ll only take a few minutes, but I think you might enjoy it.
Imagine for a second that you just lost your job. Further, imagine that the industry in which you’ve been trained and are working in has just disappeared.
What are you going to do? Are you going to go out and look for another job? A job at an Enron or a Worldcom? Or at a big bureaucracy with 100 people working in accounts payable and a budget for strategy consultants of several million dollars a year?
What if there were no choice… what if you had to start something? Anything. What would it be?
You don’t need a good idea to start a business—you can steal one. Find someone in another town, another state, another industry—and do what they’re doing. Once you get started, your original idea is going to be replaced anyway. Smart entrepreneurs don’t stick to the original business plan. You’ll realize that every day is another day closer to success, and changing the plan is part of the plan.
The best part of this exercise is when you realize that you are smart enough, motivated enough and focused enough to actually do this. That once you decide that you could actually run the place, you’ll realize that no other option is as satisfying.
Quit your job. Right now*. Stop doing something that’s crazy, risky and ill-considered. (Your current job is all three). Stop working for the factory and start building something that people will remember.
Here’s the crux of the matter: organizations where the people  doing the work are the very same people who are making the decisions are more likely to succeed in the long run. Just about all the sins of American business (from environmental despoliation to accounting fraud) can be pinned on the anonymous bureaucracy. Entrepreneurs can’t be anonymous—it’s your decision, your policy, your work, your business—and so you’re fast and honest, or you’re out. There’s nowhere else to pass the buck.
Is it scary? Well, just for a second, consider the alternative. You could work for Motorola or Adelphia or even AT&T, always wondering when the company was going to downsize you at the same time you were busy doing whatever the boss asked just to be sure you’d be the last to be fired…
Sounds to me like running a tiny business is totally safe in comparison.
*Actually, you don’t have to quit right now. You could just decide  to quit right now. One of the best parts of the no-infrastructure economy is that you can start in your spare time. Hey, it worked for eBay.","September 5, 2002","entrepreneurship, job security, corporate culture"

Is tricking people a valid business strategy?,"It’s hard to imagine standing at a cocktail party and answering the question, “So, what do you do for a living?” with, “Well, I trick people into giving me money.”
I just switched some domains from register.com to another domain registry service. The guys at register have raised subtle duplicity to a high art. After you notify them that you want to change companies, they send you a note to confirm the switch. This, of course, is a fine security move.
The note begins with several paragraphs about how great their services are, and then has a link. It appears that this might be the l ink to authorize the change, but it’s not… in fact, it’s the link to DENY the change! Read a few more paragraphs down, and there’s the link. Click it within a few days or it becomes invalid.
Click on the link. It appears that you’re done. But if you stop now, the change won’t get authorized. You must now check the box on the new screen. And THEN you must click CONFIRM. It’s easy to imagine that you’re done now, and you’ll close the window. But if you do, they deny the change.
You must go to yet another screen and once again confirm the change (that’s four clicks and three screens when one click would have been sufficient).
This is all very Microsoftian in my opinion.
As subscriptions, ship-till-I-tell-you-to-stop and other business models enter the online arena (where the profit margin is 100%), we’re going to see a lot more of this, I’m afraid. Almost fifteen years ago, when I first did an online project for Prodigy, I was told that their best customer was someone who paid the $10 a month fee but never used the service. If someone FORGOT that they had signed up for Prodigy with their credit card, it might take years before they noticed the billing. While that may have seemed like the right strategy at the time, it’s pretty clear that it wasn’t much of a long-run strategy.
I’m the biggest fan in the world of the milkman’s return. The idea of subscriptions that save time and money for both parties is a no-brainer way to run a business. But if you have to trick people into doing business with you, it’s not much of a strategy, is it?","October 1, 2002","business strategy, tricking customers, subscription model"
When people become cogs,"The cornerstone of the industrial revolution was the simple idea that management could dramatically increase productivity by buying machines that did what they were told, were cheap and could scale.
As we’ve moved to a service economy, though, machines can’t handle much of the work. People do.
I thought of this the other day as I got yet another outbound telemarketing call, this one from the local Yellow Pages. The caller, when pressed, admitted he was calling me from India.
I spoke to him for a while and then his supervisor. They were both risking their jobs, though, because everything they did was ruled by the script. Follow the script or lose your job. Follow the script or see your pay docked. Follow the script or you don’t get a good commission.
What so many people in the USA and Europe don’t realize is that their jobs are being scripted. Relentlessly. And once they’re scripted, why exactly should the boss keep paying you? There’s someone cheaper– in another state, in a prison, in a beautiful country with a low cost of living–who can follow your script instead of you.
This is the giant unwritten headline of our post-industrial economy. If your job isn’t creative/interactive or local, it’s probably going to go away.  Offshore software programmers charge by the line, and the boss doesn’t have to meet them or give them benefits. Just because you can code/call/file/process or type doesn’t mean you’re secure. The winners are going to be the bosses (quick, become a boss!) and the fast-changing creative types. That and the folks with a jackhammer on your local street corner.
This is great news for people willing to work cheap, especially those with talent and a local economy with a low cost of living. Of course, they’re not safe either, because there’s always someone willing to take their place once they become too expensive.
I think our export of “good” jobs is a fine thing. It makes the world a smaller, better and more prosperous place. When you woke up this morning, though, that probably wasn’t the first thing on your mind. You were worried about your favorite person–you.
So, what should you do? Now, before it’s too late, realize one basic truth: Safe is Risky.

The power (and the fear) of self determination,"or… are we stuck in High School?
I had two brushes with higher education this week.
The first was at a speech I gave in New York. There were several Harvard Business School students there, invited because of their interest in marketing and exceptional promise (that’s what I was told… I think they came because they had heard that Maury Rubin would make a great lunch!).
Anyway, they asked for my advice in finding marketing jobs. When I shared my views (go to a small company, work for the CEO, get a job where you actually get to make mistakes and do something) one woman professed to agree with me, but then explained, “But those companies don’t interview on campus.”
Those companies don’t interview on campus. Hmmm. She has just spent $100,000 in cash and another $150,000 in opportunity cost to get an MBA, but…
The second occurred today at Yale. As I drove through the amazingly beautiful campus, I passed the center for Asian Studies. It reminded me of my days as an undergrad (at a lesser school, natch), browsing through the catalog, realizing I could learn whatever I wanted. That not only could I take classes but I could start a business, organize a protest movement, live in a garret off campus, whatever. It was a tremendous gift, this ability to choose.
Yet most of my classmates refused to choose. Instead, they treated college like an extension of high school. They took the most mainstream courses, did the minimum amount they needed to get an A, tried not to get into “trouble” with the professor or face the uncertainty of the unknowable. They were the ones who spent six hours a day in the library, reading their textbooks.
The best part of college is that you could become whatever you wanted to become, but most people just do what they think they must.
Is this a metaphor? Sure. But it’s a worthwhile one. You have more freedom at work than you think (hey, you’re reading this on company time!) but most people do nothing with that freedom but try to get an A.
Do you work with people who are still in high school? Job seekers only willing to interview with the folks who come on campus? Executives who are trying to make their boss happy above all else? It’s pretty clear that the thing that’s wrong with this system is high school, not the rest of the world.
Cut class. Take a seminar on french literature. Interview off campus. Safe is risky.","November 12, 2002","self-determination, higher education, risks"
My friend Lionel died Friday,"Lionel Poilane was the world’s greatest baker. He was also an extraordinary personality, a visionary entrepreneur and a kind and thoughtful man.chez Poilâne
I was supposed to have lunch with him in a few weeks–and lunch with Lionel was always a treat.  Lionel embodied just about everything I’ve been writing about for the last few years. He was remarkable. His bread was standard fare at just about every two and three star restaurant in Paris–because it was different. He was roundly criticized at first (he refused to bake baguettes, for example) but the extraordinary qualities of his bread (and his sparkling personality) won over the critics. We don’t have enough gutsy entrepreneurs in the world, and now we’ve got one less.
On my first visit with him (I was the weird American tourist who refused to leave the shop without some raw dough I could turn into a sourdough starter back home) he invited me to breakfast, gave me a tour of the world’s largest collection of bread cookbooks and pumped me for internet advice. I think of him every time I put a piece of bread in my mouth or see a really stylish, cool new business idea…
I’ll miss Lionel.

Lesson Learned in NYC,"So, I stumbled into a bookstore of a major chain yesterday. I couldn’t help myself… bought five books. As I finished checking out, the clerk said, “Can I have your email address for our newsletter?”
By reflex, I just said, “no.” Too much spam, not enough trust, no real need to read their newsletter. Then, of course, I got curious. “Do many people say no?” I asked…
“In fact, almost everyone does,” she said. Obviously, asking wasn’t her idea.
In the old days, when permission was new, all you had to do was ask. Now, it seems, it’s not so easy.
What if she had said, “Hey, good for you. You just qualified for a $20 gift certificate. Want them to email it to you? You also get a list of special books six times a year…”
That’s a totally different offer, right? That’s an offer about me, not them. Something I can use right now. A definite promise of what I’m going to get (and not get) by email.","January 30, 2003","newsletter, permission marketing, customer engagement"
Always test first,"Reminded of a good lesson today. If you’re a Fast Company reader, you may have read my article in the latest issue:In Praise of the Purple Cow. For a limited time, the article offers a copy of my new book in exchange for postage and handling.
Anyway, people who signed up before the store was ready for orders got a message from Fast Company alerting them that they could finish their order now.
Problem was, the URL was wrong. Ouch!

Been thinking about online dating,"No, not doing it. Just thinking about what it means. (jumping to conclusions can get you in big trouble, buddy).
In the last twenty-four hours, I’ve read about the big services launching huge ad campaigns, I’ve seen stickers on store windows and heard about people using services likeMatch.com. Must be a trend.
If you haven’t taken a look, it’s worth a glance. We’re talking about women with Harvard MBAs or residencies at major New York hospitals. Men who are running non-profits or training for the Olympics (at least they say they are).
What’s this all about? And why should we care?
Well, if we add to this phenomenon the huge growth of monster.com (and the death of the newspaper classifieds) its seems as if personal marketing is now officially important.
You market yourself to get a job (not wait to find a classified for a job you’re qualified for and actually want.) You market yourself to find a mate (not wait until someone finds you in a singles bar or adores your cute little dog in the park). What used to be the exclusive province of Coca Cola or Amway is now at the heart of just about everyone’s life.
Marketing, after all, is about putting a product out there and finding an audience for it.
So…
When you market yourself, are you boring? Invisible? Easy to pass up?
Just as companies have no choice but to depend on thePurple Cow, on remarkable products and on word of mouth, I think the lesson of all this personal advertising is NOT that you can advertise yourself to a happy home and job, but that it’s ultimately word of mouth that’s going to make it work. It’s word of mouth that points people to your singles page or word of mouth that forwards your resume to the right guy. The difference now is that this digital word of mouth (call it an ideavirus if you want) is aided by a personal web site with your religion and desires on it, or a hotjobs website with your Linux skills outlined.
Used to be we could count on the “marketing department” to take care of our company’s stuff. Of course, that’s not true anymore. The only way to make a Purple Cow is for everyone in the company to contribute. With online dating, the same is true.
It’s no longer good enough to be good enough. With 100,000 singles out there, and 10 million resumes, the only people getting what they want are the ones exceptional enough to stand out.","January 27, 2003","online dating, personal marketing, visibility"

Marketing plan for a marketing book,"Loyal readers will remember that I used permission marketing techniques to market my bookPermission Marketing. If you wrote to (it still works): free@permission.com, you get the first four chapters of the book for free. I ended up with an astonishing 150,000 plus requests, and it made the book successful.
WithUnleashing the Ideavirus, I decided to follow the advice in the book and give the book away for free. (it’s still free atwww.ideavirus.com). We ended up, by my estimate, spreading 2 million copies around the world that way. As that happened, the hardcover edition went to #5 on Amazon US, reaching #4 in Japan.
So, withMy new book, Purple Cowthe challenge was to create a plan that represented the ideas in the book itself. In a nutshell:Sell what people are buyingFocus on the early adopters and sneezersMake it remarkable enough for them to pay attentionMake it easy for them to spreadLet it work its own way to the mass market.
So, I started with a topic I knew a population was interested in–new marketing ideas. Books about change are important, but nobody gets excited about change they way they get excited about Jet Blue.
Working with my colleagues at Fast Company, we put an excerpt from the book on the cover of the February issue (In Praise of the Purple Cow). In that article, we mentioned that subscribers and readers could get a free copy of the book if they paid $5 for postage and handling (while supplies last, only in the USA, close cover before striking):Get a Free Copy of Purple Cow….
So far so good. More than 650 people signed up in the first 24 hours, and ALL the free books we allocated (about 5,000) will be gone soon after I write this.
The next step was to do something else remarkable and make it easy to spread the idea. So here goes: The book is NOT available on Amazon and NOT available for sale one at a time. The only way to buy one is to buy TWELVE! Visitthe Purple Cow web pageand you can see how you can buy a set. Obviously, the goal is to get you to share 11 with your colleagues, further spreading the word.
Did I mention that we ship the book in a real honest-to-goodness milk carton? We do.
So, pretty soon the 4,000 copies we allocated for this bulk offer will be gone.* Then what happens?
Well, my hope is that after seeding the sneezers, the book itself is remarkable enough and Purple enough that other people will want a copy. By then, my big-time New York publisher (who shall be revealed soon) will have books ready for every bookstore in the land.
This plan, which seems risky and chaotic, is exactly the sort of thing I’m recommending for most new products. Small risks, focused audiences, limited mass marketing. Not that risky. But if you’re used to the other way, yes, chaotic.
*if you do the math, you can see it was hardly risky at all. With 10,000 copies printed, the first print run is extremely unlikely to lose money, even at the extremely low retail pricing we’re using to get it started. You know what’s risky? What’s risky is telling you my plans in advance, because when they fail (and they do! often!) I look pretty dumb. But here I am, as a public service, marketing out loud.","January 21, 2003","Marketing plan, Purple Cow, permission marketing"
A Purple Cow I just stumbled upon,"I finally had four Jet Blue flights in a row, enough time to watch my copy of Memento. This movie cost about $5 million to make and was one of the most profitable movies of the year (last year… the year before?).
It succeeded because it was remarkable. The movie runs backward. There are websites around the world devoted to decoding it. And the official site (which couldn’t have cost $10,000 to make) is brilliant and only reinforces the puzzle.
Just as I sought out the movie (“people who bought Pi also bought Memento…”) and told you about it, thousands of others did the same–

So… in the short term, if you’ve got a bunch of music on your Mac, you can use a powerful remote control (just jazz? just Coltrane? just songs from last week?) and play it on your stereo. In the long run, because the protocol is open, developers will come up with ways to synch or program or who knows what.

Udderly breathtaking,"Just got this picture in my email box.That’s Charles Gerardi, VP Advertising at a major florida newspaper. He’s standing with his brand new Purple Cow. Here’s his story:
“Coming off of a very difficult year 2001 in our business (newspaper advertising sales), we needed a “rallying cry” to get focused on turning things around in 2002…and your theory of the “Positive Feedback Loop” (Survival Is Not Enough) was just the catalyst. By channeling our energies into positive recognition, we were able to get off to a fast start, making our revenue budget in January (for the first time in many months).
As the achievement momentum built throughout the year, we’d soon adopted Zooming! as our theme for the year. I began getting e-mails from many on my staff telling me about how they were zooming. (By April, we’d even had t-shirts made for everyone with “Zoom!, Zoom!, Zoom!” down the sleeve). When it was all said and done, we’d made our revenue goal in each of the 12 months of the year, and set an all-time performance record for the company. And people were loving their work!
Now for 2003, our focus had to be very different– doing the little things right so that we remained efficient and operationally sound. But this isn’t very glamorous stuff…this is doing the basics, the fundamentals well so that our foundation stayed strong. This time, we went in search of Purple Cows…the remarkable performances from amongst the herd of mundane tasks we do every day.
Well, that’s caught on too…Purple Cows are appearing everywhere…everyone is talking about them, looking for them, celebrating them.
And the excitement really took off yesterday when our new mascot– !Mooz– arrived at our offices…painted purple, of course. Found it on Ebay. Now !Mooz (Zoom! backwards… get it?) travels from department to department each day, inspiring the team to stay focused on doing the little things right to keep us on track. People have even started adding their own personal touches to her…it’s quickly becoming our roving graffiti board for good works.”

Announcing the Purple Cow workshop,"Longtime readers will remember that I don’t do consulting. As flattering as it is to believe that a successful organization might actually want my advice about their problems, I’m really hesitant to take this sort of commitment on. Why? Because I figure if I charge someone to solve their problems, I better be confident that I can. And in my experience, a consultant rarely solves your problems—you do. So I’m much happier teaching people to fish.
That said, it’s clear that there’s a lot of excitement about the Purple Cow concept and many people want the energy and insight they can get from brainstorming in person. So, here’s the first in what will become a series of semi-public Purple Cow training and brainstorming sessions.
WHAT YOU GET: 6 hours of intensive brain workout. The first two hours are me, laying the groundwork. The next 4 hours are you (and the other attendees) sharing their specific problems and challenges. As a group, we’ll figure out a thousand PC-approved ways of being remarkable, not invisible.
THE GUARANTEE: I’ve run sessions in my office before on other topics, and I can happily tell you that no one has ever taken me up on the following: If you don’t think you got ideas and insights that were worth way more than you paid to come, it’s free. I’ll give you back all your tuition.
HOW MUCH? $800 per person. Second person in your organization comes for $400, unless it’s your boss—she pays $300.
LUNCH? On me.
WHERE? In my funky office at 145 Palisade St, Dobbs Ferry, NY, 12 miles north of New York City. You can get here on the train from Grand Central in about 40 minutes.
WHEN? Thursday, May 8th. Starts at 10 sharp. Finished by 4, but you can hang for another half hour or so if you want to chat.
HOW TO SIGN UP? This is a very informal process, because space is so limited. Drop me an email at seth@sethgodin.com. Make sure you put the word YOGURT in the subject line. Why yogurt? Well, it’s milk from a cow, with some culture added, then you shake it up and the thing you end up with is better than what you started with. Sort of.",,"Purple Cow, workshop, brainstorming"

Spam spam spam (part 1),"Executives at AOL, MSN and Yahoo! were obviously reading my blog several months ago about the easiest way to put an end to spam. They announced today a plan to work together to create a whitelist of permission marketers (and, one assumes, that leads to a blacklist of everyone else).

However, without a mechanical way to enforce people from sending anonymous mail, it’s not going to matter at all.

These are exhaustive listings of companies, contact info and accounting data, for sale to all manner of marketers. In order to make the listings work, the companies have to keep them up to date.
The state of the art is to phonespam CEOs of small businesses and ask them a bunch of personal questions. The end result is a (not surprisingly) small response rate.
Today, they resorted to trickery.
The caller informed me that they were a package delivery company and they had a shipment for us, delivered tomorrow. They wanted to confirm the address and such. They asked, “Are you at 145 Palisade Street?” I went along, because of course I wanted my package.

I had also previously read the “Tipping Point” by Malcom Gladwell and thinking of these two books is where I came up with a “possible” title for your next book.  I was glad to see a link to Gladwell’s website on your “IdeaVirus” site  leading me to think there may be some point of collaberation between the two of you.

The problem with “self-regulation”,"Is that it’s usually “no regulation.”
I was at the local Modell’s sporting goods store this morning, killing time before an appointment by buying some socks. As I was checking out, I saw a display of liquid-filled rubber yoyo balls on the counter.
I’m intimately familiar with the toy, since they were all the rage at the local school, then summarily banned.NEWS.com.au  | Yo-yo ball banned (May 21, 2003). The ball has been banned in countries around the world, because it’s just plain dumb.
I said to the clerk, “Did you know that this toy has been banned and it’s very dangerous? You shouldn’t sell it.” She shrugged and called over the manager. The manager said (I’m not making this up), “Oh, I’ve heard they’re dangerous, but I haven’t received a recall letter.” I pointed out that he could very easily put them below the counter until the letter got there. “Nope,” he said, “I have to keep selling them.”
An hour later, I got yet another spam (I get a lot, what a surprise). It consisted of a link, together with the line, “This is a legal adv, if you got it by mistake, please email back.” (aside: never email back, because you get put on the list of suckers who read and respond to spam–then they can sell your name for more). Anyway, “Luella Crawford” knows that what she’s doing isn’t RIGHT. She knows she should self-regulate. But she doesn’t. She doesn’t because it’s more important to her to make $1 than to save millions of people from having to invest five seconds each on the delete key.
In both cases, these law-abiding citizens would probably stop if they were required to.
If it’s important, the community should say, “stop it.” Relying on the conscience of strangers is a long shot, imho.","May 27, 2003","self-regulation, consumer safety, corporate responsibility"
Does a simple form matter?,"I’m going to a conference in July atThe St. Regis –In order to get a room in the hotel, I’ve got to fill out and fax back a form.
The form is on blue paper (?), it has lots of capital letters. It has tiny little lines for including my information, it doesn’t include a phone number, an email address or a way to register online. It’s also a little cheesy looking.
The reason this matters is that harried consumers of all stripes (especially business to business consumers) have nothing left but tiny cues to decide if something is good or not. A piece of email might be great, or it might be spam… and it’s just a few spurious characters in the subject line that set them apart. A hotel might be truly wonderful, or it might just have a really nice facade and website. A telemarketer might truly be raising money for a legitimate charity, or she might be keeping 90 cents on the dollar.
In a world filled with fraud, the little cues are suddenly the most important ones. Design matters a lot. Design, amazingly, is pretty cheap. For $100, this form could have been amazing. It would have cost them perhaps a penny a reservation over the next year, and it would have communicated an awful lot about the hotel.",,"Form design, consumer trust, hotel registration"

Amazon.com: Books: The Pursuit of Wow!Tom Peters at his best–the book that will push you to do the safe (risky) thing you must do to make your products remarkable.
Amazon.com: Books: My Life in Advertising and Scientific Advertising: Two Works (Advertising Age Classics Library)Very old, very good. If you’re doing any advertising, you have a professional obligation to read this.
Amazon.com: Books: The Art of Innovation: Lessons in Creativity from Ideo, America’s Leading Design FirmI don’t know if you can teach this kind of creativity, but you can certainly raise your expectations by seeing how well they do design.
THE REPUBLIC OF TEA.Out of print, but findable at abebooks and other spots, this is a book about an entrepreneur getting his head around the otaku of his audience.
Amazon.com: Books: Stop Stealing Sheep & Find Out How Type Works, Second EditionThis book helped me see design differently. Good design costs just as much as bad design, but it breaks through all sorts of clutter.
Amazon.com: Books: Zig Ziglar’s Secrets of Closing the SaleThe biggest challenge most executives face is selling their ideas, not their products. And selling internally is a lot like selling in the street. This is the best book I’ve ever read about selling anything at all…
Amazon.com: Books: The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big DifferenceMalcolm Gladwell’s breakthrough insight was to focus on the micro-relationships between individuals, which helped organizations realize that it’s not about the big ads and the huge charity balls… it’s about setting the stage for the buzz to start.
Amazon.com: Books: Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast AsiaThis book outlines the reasons why many efforts to jumpstart third-world economies fail. It’s not just peasants, though.  Many of your prospects feel precisely the same way.
Amazon.com: Books: Positioning: The Battle for Your MindThis book is built around the brilliant insight that your prospect doesn’t care nearly as much about what you do as you do, and thus you must boil down your offering into a unique slot that repositions the competition.

Time to start milking the cow (part 2),"Simon from the UK writes to me about the change in marketing and product development for the Smart car, a remarkable Cow that’s making a big splash in Europe. It’s a truly tiny car, one that has influenced a whole generation of cars.
Apparently, Simon writes, Mercedes is going to average the car out, making it more appealing to the masses. He and I agree that it’s way too early for that. There are plenty of average cars to choose from—it’s not clear why consumers will choose the newly average Smart ahead of lots of other, more proven average cars.
Another JetBlue thought: Have you noticed how the audio experience changes the way you feel at the airport?
In a crowded terminal, when the folks making gate announcements start yelling or talking fast or acting panicked about a full flight, it makes everybody uptight. Even the little computerized voice that tells you which gate agent to talk to sounds a little annoyed.
What if the airlines realized that the product that they sell isn’t the plane, it’s the idea of a safe and comfortable (maybe even fun) trip. What if every announcement was pre-recorded by Clint Eastwood or J. Lo? Or if all the flight announcements were as funny as the one I heard today (your snacks are being handed out by Tom, who’s single and looking for love. Hey, if you marry him, you can fly free!) Even simpler, what if every announcement was calm, slow and easy to understand? That’s free, but it’s worth noticing.

Time to stop milking the cow?,"Jet Blue, part 2: I wrote a lot of nice things about Jet Blue in Purple Cow. The idea of combining remarkable pricing with great planes, amazing people, an amazing attitude and a sense of humor is something that is irresistibly spreadable.
Today, I flew Jet Blue to Florida to give a talk. The good news (for them) is that the plane was full. The bad news is that everywhere I looked, there was a lot of cow milking going on.
The person who issued me my ticket shook her head and said, “no way I can get you an exit row an hour before the flight.” Of course, she was right, but in the old days, they would have said, “I’ll do my best!” Same outcome, but a different attitude matters so much.
Walking down the jetway, I heard two flight attendants whining about uniform allocations, just like you might hear on a ‘real’ airline.
Jet Blue is flying more people and more flights than ever. They have every temptation to milk the cow while the milking is good. But I wonder if they’re rushing it.",,"Jet Blue, customer service, airline experience"

How the product looks, how expensive it is and where it is sold mean more than celebrity endorsements or mass-market distribution as far as Nike is concerned, reports Maureen Tkacik in The Wall Street Journal. Those relatively recent insights have helped Nike introduce “some of its best selling shoes in years” in recent months. It’s also an outlook far different from Nike’s early days, circa 1975, when Nike craved the mass-market but buyers for the Foot Locker chain resisted Nike’s line, dismissing it as “unbranded” footwear.

The power of a hit,"One thing I didn’t write about that much in my latest book is the phenomenon that allows a new product to cross the chasm and reach the vast majority that are so busy ignoring you.
It’s the hit effect.
When all the early adopters at radio stations start playing a Norah Jones song, it becomes a hit. Billboard magazine charts it. It spreads. First to radio stations that only play what’s on the list, then to consumers who only buy what’s on the list.
When all the early adopters in silicon valley start carrying a Blackberry pager, it becomes a hit. They feature it at Fry’s. It spreads. First to the friends of the geeks, then to people who buy what nerds buy.
The middle of the market wants to be safe. They want to buy what others are buying, read what others are reading. And scorekeepers–like bestseller lists and cash register displays–are the barometer they use to determine whether a new idea is safe yet.
Tivo’s challenge, for example, is that Tivo is essentially a private device. There’s no obvious list it could be on. No retailer it can dominate. As a result, it takes far longer for it to jump over to the middle of the market.
One lesson here is to try to create products that have obvious lists. The second is to figure out how to work with early adopters in a focused, coordinated way to get on that list.",,"hit effect, early adopters, market adoption"

How wrong is the DMA? How right is Verizon (huh!),"So, it appears that on Friday, about 735,000 people signed up in just 17 hours for the do not call list (www.donotcall.gov). That’s about 12 per second.
When 12 people a second, or almost one in 150 households sign up for a service in the very first day, the message is pretty loud and clear. While the head of the Direct Marketing Association may not LIKE this outcome, the fact remains that it’s very pronounced. Instead of fighting it every step of the way, instead of insisting that they have the right to steal attention from people who don’t want it taken away, the DMA would be better off figuring out how to get permission, don’t you think?
Compare this to the newly revitalized (and consumer aware) Verizon, which just announced it will no longer fight to prevent you (and me) from keeping our cell phone numbers when we switch services. While this will no doubt lead to less amazing deals for signing up with a cell phone service, it’s so clearly beneficial to users that it was going to happen one way or the other. Better to give up, I say, then to fight a battle against your customers.
On that topic, I just can’t tell you how stupid the RIAA looks in all their writings about why they are now planning on suing 12 year olds and their parents.

Naming a business,"Greg Harrington writes, “I’ve been thinking quite a bit about a topic lately—how to best name a business—and in looking for some ideas, I’ve reviewed several of your books, but don’t find anything in the way of a thorough treatment of this topic.”
Here’s what I think:First, the main point: a brand name is a peg that people use to hang all the attributes of your business. The LESS it has to do with your category, the better.
If you call yourself International Postal Consultants, there’s a lot less room to hang other attributes. Some names I like? Starbucks. Nike. Apple.
Second, please pick a real english word, or a string of them. Axelon and Altus are bad. Jet Blue, Ambient and Amazon are good.
Third, be sure it’s easy to spell AND pronounce. Prius is a bad name. I can’t tell anyone to buy a Prius because I’m embarrassed I’ll say it wrong.
Fourth, don’t obsess about getting a short web name. If you want to name your venture capital firm Nickel (a great name, imho) then you could have www.NickelVenture.com and that would be fine. The only way this turns into a problem is if the current owner of the URL is a competitor (which won’t happen if you pick a non-obvious name, as I write in #1 above).
If you follow these pieces of advice, you’ll discover that there are literally millions of names available to you (lemonpie, for example, is perfect for a scuba tour company. So are orangepie, melonpie and kiwipie). You will have far fewer trademark hassles. You will have no trouble coming up with a cool name that means nothing and makes it easy for you to hang a good brand upon. And you’ll have fun.
BUT, don’t forget to come up with a great tagline. “lemonpie, the easy way to learn scuba,” for example.
PS a couple more tricks:1. Use a stock photo CD and find cool pictures that match your name BEFORE you pick the name. If you can find a bunch of $30 images that work with a name, grab the pictures, then the name.2. Don’t listen to anyone else. All your friends will hate it. GOOD. They would have hated Starbucks too (you want to name your store after something from Moby Dick!??) If your friends like it, run.",,"business naming, brand name, naming tips"
Marketers are lying scum,"Here’s an interview I did with India Times. I cleaned up some of the formatting from their website so you can read it more clearly. Nobody ever said I’m afraid of hyberbole.
Consumers know marketers are liars’THE SETH GODIN INTERVIEW / MALIKA RODRIGUESTIMES NEWS NETWORK[ WEDNESDAY, JUNE 04, 2003 01:34:49 AM ]
He once said that he wished he had invented Hotmail. Small wonder then that he’s dubbed the “the ultimate entrepreneur for the Information Age” — meet one of marketing world’s greatest minds, Seth Godin. Alan Webber, founding editor of Fast Company, says, “Whatever Seth is selling is catching — and if you spend time with him, you’ll come down with it.” In an interview with Brand Equity, legendary marketing man Sergio Zyman (of Coca-Cola fame), told us that he’d recommend any of Godin’s books — “He always makes you think.”
Think again. Godin’s best-seller, Permission Marketing, was named one of Fortune magazine’s best business books in 1999. Godin’s made the bestseller lists time and again — some of his other blockbusters include Survival Is Not Enough and, more recently, Unleashing The Ideavirus. In the preface to that book, author of The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell warned: “This is a subversive book. It says that the marketer is not –and ought not to be — at the centre of successful marketing. The customer should be. Are you ready for that?”
And are you ready for the Godin magic? Here’s more: In his latest book Purple Cow, Godin describes how having an idea that’s “remarkable” is the only way a brand can survive. He looks at companies that do that — those that have invented the Purple Cow, and how they’ve been able to milk them.
Now meet Godin, the fiery entrepreneur. He was founder of Yoyodyne, the first gaming and interactive direct marketing site on the Internet, which was acquired by Yahoo! in 1998. He then joined Yahoo! as vice-president of direct marketing before leaving in 2000 for a career devoted to writing and speaking. And if you think we haven’t given you the full picture, well, he likes it that way.
In a candid and free-wheeling chat with Brand Equity from the outskirts of New York, Godin talks about what makes companies remarkable, the biggest challenges marketers have to face, and how brands can deal with growing clutter, and consumers who are increasingly cutting off communication with them. Watch out for the second installment of the interview next week as well.
You’ve written about the need for marketing to be a part of every process a company does. How does one go about building that sort of total marketing mindset?
If you’re going to be busy just buying TV ads, you can have the company make anything it wants and then the marketing department has to come up with a very clever advertising campaign. That doesn’t work any more. You have to build the marketing right into the product. The people who are going to make a product successful are the people who invent it, not the people who market it.
Look at a company like Starbucks, they don’t spend any time at all on marketing, but they spend an enormous amount of time on the quality of the coffee beans, the lighting in the stores… Because those things make the store remarkable. I saw a bunch of TV commercials that ESPN had run about two years ago in India, they were very funny. But they didn’t work. And they didn’t work because what they were promoting wasn’t on television — the commercials were funny, but the TV shows weren’t.
How does a brand like Starbucks keep reinventing itself?
They did something interesting last year, which is that they wired one thousand of their stores with wireless Internet connections. So for people like me, and I’m in the minority, I would go across an entire town to sit in a Starbucks for five minutes and check my email. And I’d tell hundreds of people about this, because it changes the way I work when I’m on the road. So that was one remarkable thing they did, instead of doing more of the same. But the big challenge they’re going to have, is there are only so many three-dollar cappuccinos a person can drink everyday. And I think they have to embrace the fact that Starbucks isn’t going to keep growing the way it was, and they’re going to have to find something new — maybe in the same building, maybe not — that is remarkable all over again.
Are there any common characteristics to all these remarkable companies?
What they all have in common is that they have nothing in common. What they all have in common is that they’re going to the edges. The mindset, all over the world is “Let’s make average products for average people”. Everywhere you go, that’s what it’s always about. Average people are now really good at ignoring marketers; they don’t pay attention any more. So, it’s now about how can I make the things on the fringe, that most people don’t want. If you make the things that most people don’t want, you may find that some people desperately want them.
Consumers today are bombarded by clutter not just in advertising messages, but with news, with terror alerts, with rumours… How are marketers reacting to this clutter?
They’re doing exactly the wrong thing: they’re running more ads. They’re putting ads on parking meters, in hotel elevators, in washrooms. Because they think that the answer to clutter is more clutter. That’s why there’s so much spam in your email box. Because marketers are desperate.
Consumers have realised that marketers are lying scum. They don’t trust them to give them permission (to talk to them) anymore, because they figure that the permission is going to get stolen. And so there are some people who are able to build a reputation,?  and they can get permission. I signed up 500 people in the last three days for my newsletter, because people know I’m not going to steal it. But there’s no way in the world anyone’s giving their email ID to Allstate Insurance, because the next thing they know they’re going to get deluged with spam.
So how do marketers deal with a situation when they’re getting less and less access to consumers? For instance, schools in the US are banning the sales of soft drinks on campuses…
Stop lying, stop cheating, and stop insisting that every single person in the world drink Coca-Cola ten times a day. Consumers have the right to keep Coca-Cola out of the elementary schools. Coca-Cola does not have the right to sell it there. And the right thing for Coke to do is not sue people to get into the schools, but invent a new product, a healthy product, a remarkable product that makes consumers’ lives actually better, and wait for people to say we’d like to sell it in schools. And they could do that, they just have to acknowledge the fact that Coke’s not going to grow the way it used to.
Lowe in the UK recently launched a channel that will show only commercials… What do you think?
The Lowe thing is a stunt. It’s remarkable that there could be a channel with only not-very-good commercials on it. But there’s no question that in a world when you could have a billion TV channels, you could have a channel that has nothing but a half hour commercial about Volvo cars. Because if you’re thinking about buying a Volvo, you’re going to want to watch that half-hour presentation. Not a slick, one-minute, sexy commercial, but a half-hour honest representation of what their car can do. And so that’s a commercial, but it doesn’t interrupt the person who doesn’t want to see it.
In a more slick way, BMW did it with those movies. There are plenty of places like Charles Schwab where you can go into one of their investment centres, and the salesperson won’t bother you, you can sit and read a brochure that honestly tells you whether you should go in for this or that.
Are marketers building an age of mega-events as far as conventional advertising goes — like the Super Bowl?
The Super Bowl is the last refuge of the interruption marketer. It’s the only place where people with tons of money can interrupt large numbers of unaggregated, average people, who aren’t really paying attention. So it’s a great place for someone with nothing better to do to spend money. It’s not going to go away until they stop spending the money, so I expect it’s going to be around for quite a while. But the fact is that there are very few, maybe no companies, that have advertised on the Super Bowl and said, we can prove that it was a good idea.
Reebok seems to think so with its Terry Tate commercial this year…
The thing is, the Terry Tate commercial (even though I don’t own a television, I saw it!) was for a commercial, really effective, and it helped them do better against Nike that week. But that’s not going to make Reebok work. The only thing that can is for Reebok to figure out on an ongoing basis, how to make a profit selling sneakers to people. And you can’t keep repeating a Terry Tate sort of experience. They’re not going to say the future of Reebok is to run lots of commercials on the Super Bowl, — that’s not why it works. Why it worked is that in a sea of really bad commercials, it was better.
I think both Reebok and Nike are trying interesting things. Both have management who realise that it’s not going to be about TV ads in the future. And so Nike, which has a long history of bringing out a new product every few days, is getting more aggressive about bringing out interesting, edgy, new products that are remarkable. Reebok, which has a tradition of not being so much a bully as Nike is going to win because they may be able to deal with consumers in a way that will keep them happy.",,"Seth Godin, marketing, consumer trust"

Remarkable is where you choose to make it,"As I travel around spreading the word of the Purple Cow, a lot of people appear confused about just what “remarkable” means. It’s not elitist. It’s not weird. It’s not cheap or expensive or big or small. It’s any or all of these things… it’s just something worth talking about.
This month’s Gourmet talks about a chain of 30+ burger places in the Northwest calledBurgerville. It’s not that expensive. But it’s AMAZING. We’re talking chocolate hazelnut shakes. Salmon (local) salad with tilamook cheese.  Onion Rings that (ready for this) are only available when onions are in season.
Worth a detour. Worth talking about. That’s remarkable.","June 20, 2003","Remarkable, Burgerville, Unique"
The difference between Apple and Amazon,"Two companies that business pundits love to talk about. But very different indeed…
Have you ever tried to return anything to Amazon? Amazon is obsessed with being remarkably boring when it comes to Customer Service. They are so good at it, so consistent, so eager to do the right thing that people tell other people.
Amazon invests in this Purple Cow. They invest a few pennies per customer per year in customer delight. They create stories about their flexibility–stories that spread. They respect their customers and they show it.
As a result, Amazon is able to milk the cow of their remarkability for a long, long time. The more they follow this path, the easier it is to do, because their systems can handle it and their customers trust them.
Compare them to Apple. Two months ago, I ordered an upgrade to Final Cut Pro. (it’s expensive). It arrived today. Actually, THEY arrived today. Two copies.
Now, there are plenty of pirates who wonder why they even need ONE legitimate copy, but there’s certainly no need for anyone with just one computer to have two.
Anyway, Apple argued with me. They insisted it was my fault. They said I should have read my receipt more carefully. They claimed that I must have had a reason for ordering two, and just because I changed my mind doesn’t mean that they should have to pay to ship it back. I pursued the conversation on behalf of you, my dear reader. Chrissy insisted that I had just ten days to ship it back, at my expense, because if I didn’t the RMA would evaporate. Moreover, I should do it in a traceable way, because if I couldn’t prove it, then, “they won’t be responsible.” Of course, it’s clear that Apple never wants to be responsible.
Apple is in the fashion business.Apple is Gucci.Apple is Calvin Klein.
No one returns a pair of Gucci shoes claiming that the heel isn’t durable. Nope. You buy them for the thrill of the hunt, not the process and not the end result. Same is true, it seems with Apple.
The problem, from a shareholder’s point of view anyway, is that this is a very, very hard cow to milk. Every time they annoy a customer or call a customer a liar, they spread a negative ideavirus about the company, and make it harder and harder to sell a productivity solution. Sure, they can continue to be fashionable (acting like Gucci is good for that niche) but they are finding the contradiction that many companies in a world of fashion find–that fashionable gets you in the door, but it’s respect that lets you build a profitable business.
Given the choice, I’d model a company after Amazon. Great growth. All built around respect and remarkability, not the sneering contempt of a fashion house.","June 14, 2003","Amazon, Apple, customer service"

Politics and the Internet (Dean isn’t “raising money on the Internet”),"So, it appears that the New York Times has discovered the fact that politicians are starting to use the Internet. Their insightful analysis begins and ends with several articles describe the Dean site as a place where donors use credit cards to make donations.
The Times (and the entire beltway establishment) appears to see the Net as just a modern version of TV–with a little junk mail thrown in. For them, it’s all about being in charge, about marketing AT people, not with them.
My favorite part of the article in today’s Times is this quote from Bob Bauer, “whose company represents Mr. Kerry, Mr. Gephartdt and … Senator Joseph I. Lieberman”. Mr. Bauer says, “…But the Internet as a revolutionary tool? I don’t know.”
So what’s the real point? The internet isn’t a tool. It’s a medium. And it’s not a medium for interactions between Dean and person A and Dean and person B. It’s a medium for interactions between A and B –about– Dean. In other words, by enabling an ideavirus to spread, the Internet allows someone without the money to buy a lot of TV to be the topic of (many) conversations.
The insight of the Dean campaign (accidental or not) is that sites like meetup.com and constituencies of online sneezers can dramatically increase the chances that your candidate will get talked about. Add to that a site optimized for the interactions you desire (where’s that banana!) and a candidate can radically recast the entire campaign process.","July 5, 2003","Internet politics, Dean campaign, media interactions"

Best summary yet of Purple Cow,In anairline magazine!,"August 11, 2003","Purple Cow, summary, airline magazine"
,"New trend in business journalism: muckraking, innuendo, schadenfreude, snide remarks and cynicism.
From today’sNew York Times(Fast Company takes a senseless beating, including plenty of editorial opinion from the writer) to most of the leading business magazines, we’re seeing exactly the same thing. The search for the scoop. The rush to demonstrate journalistic chops by refusing to accept anything at face value. The division of the world into good and bad, mostly bad.
The thing is, this is lazy journalism. It’s lazy to take potshots at the head of a car company or to search for yet another one of Martha Stewart’s bad habits. The reason it’s lazy is simple: if you get your facts even close to right, the reader is with you all the way. It’s easy to persuade people to be negative, easy to get them to pay attention to gossip, easy to defend yourself as a crusading journalist.
This, of course, is the same sort of laziness that led the very same magazines and papers to overdose on the hype just three years ago. Those stories were effervescent and glowing, but they involved just as little real understanding as today’s “exposes” do.
Do you know what’s hard? It’s hard to be inspirational. It’s hard to really understand the lessons (positive and negative) in a story and present them in a way that actually persuades, not just titillates.
Are you ready to rush out the newsstand to buy a magazine that shows us, once and for all, how some Boston real estate was insanely overpriced or how Larry Ellison isn’t actually as smart as this very same magazine told you he was two years ago? I’m not.
I don’t know about you, but I’m a sucker for an article that actually educates, or even better, inspires. Inspires me to do more, try harder, dig deeper, be more positive and persist longer. C’mon guys, I implore my colleagues, don’t be so lazy. We deserve better.

The big difference between marketing a product and a candidate,"Is not what you might think. Rolling outJohn KerryorHoward Deanis a lot like any other big money product launch. No doubt the marketers will spend way too much  money on TV, and no doubt the real impact (especially early on) comes not from blatant interruption but from ideaviruses that spread…
So the difference?
The difference is that coming in second in detergent or coffee is just fine if your overhead is appropriately small. Coming in second in politics is worthless.
I’ve been reading all the fawning Dean media hype with a bit of a smile. After all, it’s classic Purple Cow thinking. But in politics, of course, being a Purple Cow doesn’t mean you’re going to win. Which is good, otherwise we’d have peanut farmers, former actors and folks who aren’t smart enough to accept scientific facts and rational arguments running the country. Oops. You know what I mean.
I mean that being remarkable doesn’t always mean you will capture the majority. It might mean you come in second. If you’re a non-political marketer, I beg you to embrace your purpleness and TRY to come in second. Being safe is a bad idea.
If, on the other hand, you are Howard Dean, I have no idea what you should do. The word has spread among the sneezers and opinion leaders who care. Now, how do you leap the chasm to get to everyone else? I have no idea. Remember, awareness does not equal sales.

Why Web Ads Don’t Work,"A long time ago, pundits started declaring the death of the banner ad. By and large they were right–banner ads now get clickthroughs that peak at .1%, the cost per thousand is close to zero and Google and others have demonstrated that contextual text ads are far more effective.
Yet, these banner ads (in a variety of shapes and sizes) persist. What stuns me is not that they continue to hang around, but that they’re used so poorly, and (I’m hypothesizing here) so little testing is done.
Here’s an ad for the revived go.com:

Click on it (yes, some people do) and it takes you to:

I’m just amazed that this is the best they could come up with. Where’s the call to action? Why is this a better service? How does this answer the promise of the banner I clicked on? Have they tested different approaches?
The key to the process is simple: banners make a promise. Offer pages continue the promise and provide evidence that the solution is proven, legitimate and effective. If you test these steps, your yield has to go up. If it goes up, your costs go down.","September 29, 2003","Web Ads, Banner Ads, Clickthrough Rates"

Helping Jack with web design,"My friend Jack sent me a note about helping him redesign his site. He gave me a few choices about what I liked, and no surprise, I didn’t like any of the choices (multiple choice is not my forte). Here’s what I wrote back:
Here’s what I think about a web page:
You only have four paths:1. get someone to buy something right now2. get someone to give you their email address so you can build a relationship3. get someone to tell a friend4. get someone to go to another page on your site.
That’s it. Only four things worth doing.
So, what are you trying to accomplish? (Hint: picking one works better than picking two, and picking more than two is silly.)
I think we’ve learned that for most ecommerce sites, #2 and #3 are the ways to win. If you visitwhowillbeatbush.com, you can see that the entire site is built around this sort of thinking.

Some people still don’t get the permission thing,"I was listening to WNYC radio yesterday, and they were talking about the California ban on spam (mostly a full-employment bill on behalf of lawyers, but every little bit helps.) What amazed me was that after all the hoopla and five years afterPermission Marketing, a lot of people still don’t get the idea that you’re not in charge any more.
One person called in with this quandary, “I try to raise money for my companies, and I sometimes find myself sending fundraising proposals to venture capitalists by email. Most of the VCs are in California, so would I be breaking the law if I sent these–they’re unsolicited.”
Now, of course, it’s unlikely that someone at Kleiner Perkins is going to sue this guy for sending an unsolicited offering by email, but I think that’s beside the point. The real issue is this: What chance is there that someone at Kleiner is going to read an unsolicited investment proposal and then actually fund it?
The truth that so many people are missing is this: Just because you CAN get to someone by email doesn’t mean you SHOULD. Cold calling is a bad way to build a business. Cold calling in an electronic medium is even worse. Without the friction that comes from buying a stamp or printing some images or writing a letter worth reading, the recipient doesn’t value your ideas enough to do something of actual value.
What should this guy do? He should work the network. He should find someone sufficiently impressed with his idea (a friend or a colleague) that he gets connected with a legitimate introduction to someone who can help him. Or he should send a Fedex that’s enticing enough that it gets a response by email. Or he should use a socially acceptable interruption technique like advertising (gasp!).
Sorry to go on and on, but hearing this guy (and not being able to respond because they never book me on this show) was incredibly frustrating.
If someone doesn’t want to hear from you, then that’s the end of the discussion. You don’t win by barging through doors. You win by spreading ideaviruses that reach the people you need to reach.",,"permission marketing, unsolicited proposals, networking"
The DMA steps in it again,"While I’m ranting about smart (and bad) business decisions and telling the truth (my them for the day), the lawsuit yesterday about the Do Not Call list just made me sigh (okay, I laughed a little too).
The direct marketing industry sued the FTC to stop the Do Not Call list. You remember, this is the list that more than 50,000,000 of us signed up for. The one that says, “Hey, you’re bothering me, go away, don’t call.” The industry has decided that we don’t know what’s good for us, and even though we don’t want them to call, they should be entitled to take our attention just because they can make some money doing so.
First, does the industry really and truly believe that any politician on the planet would hesitate to support a list that already has 30% of the households in the country signed up for it? Who cares that it got overturned–Congress will amend the Constitution if they have to to make this thing legal. It just cost the industry money and made them look even worse.
But going a step further, why lie about it? Why do they have to claim it will cost our economy 2,000,000 jobs? That’s a lot of jobs. That’s all the soldiers in Iraq–times 15. Do they honestly believe that if people stop calling us at home during dinner that we’ll actually start buying less stuff?
More important, the Do Not Call list is the single best thing to happen to direct marketing since the invention of the catalog. Here’s a government-financed way of figuring out in advance who’s going to hang up on you. Even better, it changes the industry to a permission focus–figure out why people would WANT to have you call them, and start doing that. Permission-based industries make more money than spammers for a simple reason… it’s way more efficient.",,"Do Not Call list, direct marketing, permission-based marketing"
"Liars, cheats and fools","So, an astonishing (but not that surprising) string of news this week.
The record industry sued a “little old lady” named Sarah Ward. She’s not that old, but she’s little and she’s not a pirate. She’s never even downloaded the software you need to download the music. The RIAA has dropped the suit, but Amy Weiss, their spokesman, says, “We have chosen to give her the benefit of the doubt and are continuing to look into the facts… This is the only case of its kind.”
Now, regardless of how you feel about litigation as a business strategy, refusing to apologize is just a bad idea. This is clearly NOT the only case of its kind. Instead of stonewalling, why doesn’t the RIAA say, “This is terrific! She’s an honest citizen and we’re proud of her. We made a mistake and we apologize. We’re sending Ms. Ward a hundred CDs to apologize for bothering her. If there are any other cases like this one, we’ll drop them immediately.”
Moving on, the Wall Street Journal today has a tiny item about Clorox. It seems they ran an ad featuring slimy water mains and pipes, encouraging New Yorkers to use a Brita water filter. New York complained, calling it “a blatant mischaracterization of the world’s safest, purest water supply.”
Mary O’Connell, our next waffling spokesman, speaking on behalf of Clorox said, “The ad was never intending (sic) to be critical of the (sic) New York City’s water system. It was more about the pipes that carry the water in apartment buildings.”
Sometimes it’s hard to tell if these foiks are intending to be caricatures, or if it just turns out that way. OF COURSE the ad was criticizing the water system… if it wasn’t, why would I need a Brita water filter? Why don’t they just tell the truth?
Moving on to one of my favorite organizations, the Motion Picture Association of America (yay Jack Valenti!) has a two-pronged approach to fighting the future piracy of movies. The first is a low-budget ad campaign designed to teach us that, “Movies, they’re worth it”. According to the Times, it profiles, “among others, a set painter, stuntman and make up artist.”
The second prong? A lesson plan (including crossword puzzles featuring phrases like ‘digital theft’ and ‘Movielink’) created in conjunction with Junior Achievement. The plan is designed to indoctrinate teenagers with the ‘downloading is bad’ mantra.
Well, other than the huge success rate that advertising campaigns have had in reducing things like tobacco use [intentional use of sarcasm], do they really think that this is the answer? And when did Junior Achievement start acting as a spokesperson for maintaining entrenched industries? (Movielink is a business run by the studios.)
The reason that the ads feature the relatively low-paid craftspeople is that, of course, people don’t really care if Arnold or J. Lo. make another few bucks. The problem, of course, is that ads like this never work, and even if they did, the idea that you should pay $30 to go out to the movies to support a make-up artist you’ve never met is an awfully hard sell.
No, I don’t think downloading movies is right or legal or even convenient. I do believe, however, that it’s going to happen more and more, and people in the industry ought to tell the truth–to each other and to us. The only thing that will save the existing infrastructure is an out-of-house experience that really and truly IS worth paying for. That, and an in-house experience that is super-easy and very cheap. The music industry could have killed Napster with a $10 a month all you can eat plan (which would have easily tripled their profits) and Hollywood could do the same. But they won’t.",,"litigation, advertising, piracy"

Everything You Need to  Know About Being Selfish,"Educational piece in today’sNY Timesabout telemarketing.
Here are my favorite bits:
Bank One has 2,500 people making 12,000,000 calls a year, all so they can sell 250,000 new accounts a year. Once the ‘do not call’ list hits, it may very well turn the economics of the entire project negative.
Keystone Auto Glass calls people every 90 days and asks, “Do you have a crack or a chip?” If the answer is no, they hang up and call em back in three more months. However, when the do not call thing kicks in, “Instead of calling every three months, we may call every month.” says Ron Selfe (his real name). This means that people not smart enough to get off the list get three times as many calls, but even better, it means that, as far as Ron is concerned, the population owes him this business, and if he has to bother us three times as much to make a living, well, hey.
I loved the story of Tina Nagel, who sells “identity theft protection”, which is an overpriced ($120/yr.) service that sends you your credit report every month. She says, “What I’m doing is a valuable service. I’m telling people what their options are in life.” Tina points out that she was once the victim of identity theft. She also points out that she hasn’t bought the service.
There are about 280 million people in this country, and telemarketers, according to the article, place 104 million calls a day.
Always concerned about our best interests, the industry has filed suit in Denver, claiming that the FTC laws restricting telemarketers “restrict free speech rights and fail to consider economic consequences.”
Most of my readers aren’t telemarketers, but most of us ARE marketers. And the lesson here is awfully simple: selfish doesn’t work any more.
You can’t demand attention. In fact, it’s sort of hard to even ask for it nicely. Attention comes to you when you offer something remarkable. I hope that Tina Nagel figures that out when she’s looking for her next gig.","September 22, 2003","telemarketing, selfishness, marketing strategies"

Lesson from yesterday’s seminar,"We had a great seminar at my office yesterday (details on the next one coming soon.)
A revelation for everyone there came near the end, when we were reviewing everyone’s website. I started each review with a few questions.
“Why did you build this page? What are you trying to accomplish? Who comes? Where do you want them to click? How do you know if the page is working? What do you measure?”
The real progress for most people came just in thinking about  how they were going to answer the questions. Toward the end, though, one marketer showed us his site. He wanted the group’s advice on how to improve it. “Improve it to do what?” I asked him?
He didn’t know. He just wanted to make it better. “I haven’t updated it in a few years. How do I make it better?” He was looking for tactics, then he was going to invent a strategy to match. After a few seconds, he realized exactly what he was saying. Of course our tactics wouldn’t solve his problem because he didn’t know what his problem was!

I just got my mailed copy of the Grateful Dead Almanac, a catalog of the best and greatest new Dead stuff. This is always an expensive moment for me. As always, I followed the links and took out the credit card.
First stop wasTHE DEAD – Official Concert Recording Series. Neat idea. After buying a few, I get to the checkout, and the little tiny fine print says, “Click here to opt out of mailings from OCRS”. Huh? Opt out, guys, is spam. The notice is designed to be missed. The goal is to trick people into getting mail they don’t want to get. Sigh.
Then, it’s over to gdstore.com to buy the new Dicks Picks album, which is raved about in the Almanac. It’s not there.
So I call.
Then I get the recording that, “Due to heavy call volume…” Have you ever called a company and heard the truth? “Due to budget priorities, we decided it was cheaper to have you wait on hold for a few minutes than it was to hire more operators…”
Anyway, after a few minutes, a nice guy answered and said, “Are you calling to buy Dicks Picks #30?” I responded in the affirmative. And then he said this (I’m not making this up):
“We won’t have it until tomorrow, and until we have it, I can’t take your order.”
Yes, that’s what he meant. I checked.
Does this sound like your organization? Are the systems so out of control that we’ve forgotten how to let one person do business with another person?

My note to Susan,"I ran into an old colleague (old as in we worked together on Guts in 1990, so don’t tell me you’ve been online a long time, okay?). Susan is a very talented web designer, and like most web designers, she’s sort of in between the “oh boy, we need a website, let’s hire someone!” stage and the “oh no, the economy is in the tank, let’s cut costs!” stage.
I promised to drop her a note about the burgeoning niche I see for web designers, and here it is:
Susan,
Within two years, companies are going to spend about $5 billion a year on search engine advertising, adwords, keywords and other smart ways to get strangers to click on over to their sites.
Further proof that the web is now officially a direct marketing business.
YET, at the same time that all these companies are aggressively spending to build the right kind of traffic (not the, “hey, I tricked you with a popunder or seduced you with a bikini” ads) they’re dropping the ball.
Less than 10% of these advertisers regularly measure results.
Far fewer than that are changing their offer pages hourly.
What a waste.
People like Andrew Goodman (his site isTraffick | Minding the Internet Search Engines’ Business) understand this. They realize that test and measure and evolve is the secret to direct marketing. There are no once-and-for-all secrets. It’s a process, not an event.
So who’s going to do this work?
I think it’s going to be the next generation of web designer.
I think it goes like this:
You say to the prospect: I will work with you to build a four-page engine of revenue. The idea: the client loads it up with targeted traffic that he buys by regularly trying and testing adwords and other relevant, measurable media. Then, I will regularly, constantly tweak (or redesign) the four page site to turn those strangers into friends (and maybe, if your product is great and your followup is appropriate, you can turn those friends into customers).
The thing is, it’s probably cheaper to constantly measure and evolve and redesign a four page offer site than it is to build the annual 400 page website overhaul. And there’s no question it’s more effective.
It takes patience. It takes a lack of ego. It takes a willingness to be creative and to try new stuff, to measure what works and to do it more.
The great news about direct marketing is that when it works, you know it worked. That makes it easy to get new clients.

#,"A.Word.A.Day–Today’s Word(In case the link has changed, here’s their definition, which I LOVED):
octothorpe (OK-tuh-thorp) noun
The symbol #.
[The symbol # is derived from a shorthand way of writing lb, the abbreviation for the Latin libra (balance), just as $ is a shorthand way of writing US. Octothorpe is an alteration, influenced by octo-, of earlier octalthorpe, probably a humorous blend of octal (an eight-point pin used in electronic connections) and someone whose last name was or ended in “thorpe”, and whose identity is subject to speculation. It may be James Edward Oglethorpe, an eighteenth century English philanthropist, but more likely it is an Olympic athlete, Jim Thorpe. In the early 1960s, Bell Labs introduced two special keys in its innovative touch-tone telephone keypads, “#” and “*”, for which it needed fresh names. Having eight points, “octo-” was an obvious first element. Since the engineer involved in introducing this innovation was active in a group seeking the return of Jim Thorpe’s medals from Sweden, he whimsically added “-thorpe”, creating octothorpe. (Jim Thorpe was disqualified because of his professional status, but his medals were restored posthumously.) The “#” is also known as a pound sign, crosshatch, number sign, sharp, hash, crunch, mesh, hex, flash, grid, pig-pen, gate, hak, oof, rake, fence, gate, grid, gridlet, square, and widget mark.]
Some other eight-based words, other than the obvious octagon, octave, and octopus, are octamerous, having eight parts or organs; octane, a type of hydrocarbon in fuel and solvents; octant, the eighth part of a circle; octonare and octapody, a verse of eight feet; and octonary, pertaining to the number eight.

Scott McCloud (brilliant, blow you away cartoon theorist, who’s also a cartoonist) has a rant about BitPass. Rather than sending you to the company’s site, start with the rant, because it’s easier to understand the point of view when you see it in opposition to a critic:Misunderstanding Micropayments – Scott McCloud.
Well, I joinedBitPass, and I bought Scott’s first online for moneycomic(it’s really good, and totally worth a quarter.)
As most of you know, I’ve been at (okay, near) the forefront of the “attention equals cash” argument, pointing out that getting someone’s permission is worth far more than getting their quarter. But now that things are settling down online, I wonder if there’s a chance for BOTH to happen.

Traffic doesn’t matter,"Alexa.com does a neat trick. They track all the traffic to just about every site on the web. (Here’s theRelated Info for: sethgodin.com/sg/blog/sethgodin.html).
So, it appears that sethgodin.com is about 47,000 on the hit list, but we peaked at about 12,000 (out of a billion sites!) last May.
Conventional wisdom would tell you that if I did search engine optimization and had the blog open daughter windows instead of changing your basic window, and, and, and, I could increase my traffic.
My guess is that for most sites, it doesn’t really matter that much.
Heresy!
Here’s why:1. The single best thing you can do is change the YIELD of your site, not its raw traffic. That means changing the site to increase the number of people who do what you want them to do, not dumping more people on a broken site.
2. The next best thing you can do is encourage visitors (subtly or not) to get like-minded folks to visit. Meetup.com, for example, has got that just right.
3. You can make the most of the visitors you have by getting permission, by giving visitors the ability to sign up for more info later.
I’ve never tracked my traffic, but I track all of three of these things quite closely. Maybe once I get them all right, I’ll bother to worry about raw numbers. In the meantime, I can’t help but notice that Tom Peters is about 50,000 behind me on the Alexa list, though he has a better reputation, sells more books, changes more lives and writes better than I do.

Add a zero,"Yesterday, I got 255 pieces of spam between 3 pm and 5 pm. My friend Michael gets 500 a day. And a journalist I know, Rebecca, gets 5,000 every weekend. For those that think spam is just a nuisance, add a zero and then think about it. How long would it take YOU to sort through and delete 5,000 emails?
A problem with our networked world is that so many problems are becoming exponential ones.
The thing about spam that’s really surprising and makes me distraught is that previously reputable marketers (but lazy ones, apparently) are willing to risk their entire brand for a few bucks. Herb Cohen, who’s a fine writer, is apparently working with Warner (who should know better) on this sort of scheme. Publishers Weekly writes:
> For her next trick, McColl will do a one-day blast for Herb Cohen’s> new book, “Negotiate This! By Caring, But Not T-H-A-T Much.” Published> by Warner Books, the title is now sitting at number 838 at Amazon.

It will proclaim that Cohen> wants his book, “at the top of the Amazon.com charts today, October> 7th and he needs your help to make it happen, and for doing so, he has> created an offer that will have you stunned.”
Peggy McColl is a spammer, sending out more than a million emails at a time to people, directing them to Amazon to buy “self-help” books. I don’t know about you, but I didn’t ask Peggy to send me mail. Is this the worst kind of V*agra sort of spam? No, of course not. That’s why it bothers me so much. Once the harvesting of sort-of approximately-maybe it’s-kind-of-focused-by-topic opt-out spam becomes socially acceptable, you can certainly bet that we’ll be adding one or two more zeroes to the volume of spam that comes in every day.
The ironic twist is that Amazon spent about $33 a person building their truly permission-based opt-in list. For someone to walk in and spend .1% of that in order to have a thin shroud of respectability pulls the entire structure apart. It means that anyone who markets the right way has an even harder time starting tomorrow.
If you know Peggy or Herb or Warner, drop them a line. Let them know that acting like the DMA–that assuming that people WANT to get your junk–is a great way to ruin their brand.",,"spam, marketing, brand integrity"

Cufflinks,"If cufflinks didn’t exist and you invented them, would they succeed?
I’ve got one shirt in my closet with french cuffs, and as I looked at it, hanging there quite lonely, I got to thinking about cufflinks.
Cufflinks are arguably a nice way for men to wear jewelry, and they were no doubt functional back in the day. But it’s difficult to argue much of a utlitarian use today.
Yet they persist.
They persist because stamping them out completely is essentially impossible. They are an anachronism, part of a system that may never go away.Cufflinks.com The internet’s formalwear superstorecan sell plenty of reversible nautical cufflinks (“What! you got me cufflinks that weren’t reversible!?”) because the shirtmakers support them by selling shirts with holes. If there were no holes, there would be no cufflinks. As long as there are holes, there will be a demand for them.
So…
So if you’re trying to invent a product or service that requires the rest of the industry to put a hole out there for you to fill, good luck.
And if you can figure out a way to profit from an existing “hole”, you’ve got yourself a huge advantage.
Audible.com, for example, needed the world to make an MP3 player in order for them to succeed. What a crazy gamble! Fortunately, just in time, it happened. But now that the MP3 player is here, I bet some smart folks are going to figure out something else to put on an audio player… what about city walking tours, with local ads?",,"cufflinks, invention, market demand"

Bush’s Poodle?,"No, not a political rant, but a discussion of how ideas spread.
How did Tony Blair end up with this nickname? A quick Google search finds more than 2,000 matches.Google Search: “bush’s poodle”.
My earliest cite is from September, 2002, but I don’t have the resources to find the original coiner of the phrase.
What I want to know is:Why “poodle”? Why not “puppy” or “labrador”? Or, forget about dogs, what about any other range of vaguely insulting animal types?
How is it that this has spread and stuck?
Without question, poodle is a funny word. It has a funny vowel/dipthong connection and it’s fun to say. It is also somewhat dandy-esque, with the image of the beautifully coiffed french poodle hanging out there in the background.
Is this the sort of thing we can do on purpose? “Frequent Flyer Miles”, for example, have that marvelous F alliteration at the front. Does that explain why the phrase has stuck, while countless competitors offering things like Points have faded away?
Political discourse, of course, is filled with name calling, and sometimes the names spread. Tricky Dick had a nickname, but Gerald Ford didn’t. Dan Quayle got stuck with “potatoe”, but other vice presidents, certainly as dumb, got off easy. How come?
I know I’m asking a lot of unanswerable questions, and maybe it’s just because I couldn’t resist doing a blog entry entitled “Bush’s Poodle”. I think there’s something here though.
In order to maximize the currency of your chosen ideavirus, it helps if your slanderous positioning (or profitable meme) has a few characteristics:
1. self-explanatory–both the teller and the listener have a high chance of not feeling stupid.
2. verbally fun to pass on–the teller enjoys saying it even if the listener doesn’t enjoy hearing it.
3. a safe target–Vice presidents, felonious presidents and heads of foreign nations are pretty fair game. Remember Boutros Boutros Ghali?
4. TV (and now web) friendly–Dan Quayle, for example, was an easy mark because of images like this one. The Blair thing, while not image based, is the sort of phrase that just sounds great on the radio (I heard it three times yesterday).

As we think about spreading our own ideas, I think we can profit from seeing how they work in the world of politics. Whether you’re raising money for your  non-profit (“Will you sponsor me for a walkathon”) or launching a new brand, picking the right phrase and image can accelerate the spread of your idea.","November 20, 2003","1.

Civil War,"Today is the 140th anniversary of the Gettysburg Address. I’ll admit that until I heard it today on the radio, the only part I knew was the famous beginning.
It’s short, and I reprint it below. It’s worth reading, I think, because it is so relevant today. We’re in the midst of another civil war, one that is being fought on dozens of fronts–political, commercial and social. At its essence is the idea of respect.
For Lincoln to stand in front of 15,000 people (no microphone) and be so humble and simple was an act of courage. To do it without demonizing the other side, without bending to special interest groups and without invoking whatever higher authority he could imagine to explain why he was right and everyone else was wrong–that’s what statesmen are for.
The next time your business, your boss or your politicians want to treat another individual as somehow LESS, I think it’s your job to call them on it. If all men are truly created equal, we ought to start treating them that way.
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on thiscontinent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to theproposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged ina great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation soconceived and so dedicated can long endure.
We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion ofthat field as a final resting-place for those who here gave theirlives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting andproper that we should do this. But in a larger sense, we cannotdedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground.The brave men, living and dead who struggled here have consecratedit far above our poor power to add or detract. The world willlittle note nor long remember what we say here, but it can neverforget what they did here. It is for us the living rather to bededicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought herehave thus far so nobly advanced.
It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us–that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for whichthey gave the last full measure of devotion–that we here highlyresolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that thisnation under God shall have a new birth of freedom, and thatgovernment of the people, by the people, for the people shallnot perish from the earth.","November 19, 2003","Gettysburg Address, civil war, equality"

We’re doing the same thing with products, their spokespeople and the people we work with and hire.

Christmas Card Spam,"Call me scrooge if you want to, but I can’t help but notice a new trend. Call it Christmas Card Spam.
Christmas cards used to be handwritten and thoughtful. They took a lot of time and were thus sent just to people who actually wanted to receive them.
Then the professional printers stepped in and Christmas cards became a bulk item. Businesses get them by the hundreds. Even ordinary folk can count on dozens of cards every year. You might not wanted to get a Christmas card from your Xerox machine service guy, but hey, it only took a second to chuck it. More important, the cost of the card and the stamp made it prohibitively expensive for the Xerox guy to send 1,000 or 4,000 cards.
Today, thanks to the zero-cost nature of email, the equation has been completely reversed. The cost to the sender of a card is essentially zero. The cost to the recipient, however, is significant. This stupid snowman card (who, exactly, is Telemak and why are they writing to me?) took about 20 seconds to receive via my DSL connection. Watching my email take five or six minutes is enough to induce Dickensian feelings, for sure. Telemak must have sent 10,000 cards… costing the recipients about 50 hours of download time.
So, one more treasured tradition trashed by new media.

January 8–for non profitsJanuary 28–for everyone
You can see some testimonials about my seminars here:Purple Cow by Seth Godin: Workshops
I don’t do consulting, and there’s no sales pitch here–I’ve got nothing more to sell you. The goal of the seminar is to put you in a room with like-minded people and to really push to create practical breakthroughs that you can turn into action.
The seminars have the following structure:10 to 12:30–I summarize my thinking on how ideas spread, on permission and on Purple Cows.During lunch, we do a lot of one on one interactions1:15 to 3–We take turns reviewing your website, your mission, your marketing message, etc. No holds barred. Really and truly.3 to 4:30–I talk about my new book (out in May) and we go even deeper into your particular issues.
The goal is that by the end you’ve got the same tools I do, so you can analyze your own organization without my help.
At the first seminar, on the 8th of January, I’ll be running a non-profits only seminar in my office in Dobbs Ferry, NY (about 40 minutes from NYC). This seminar is free and there are only 33 seats available. If you run or have a great deal of influence at a non-profit organization, I’m inviting you to come spend the day in my loft. Because it’s free, you sort of need to apply by sending me a note. Write to sethgodin@yahoo.com and use the word TRANSFORM in your subject line.Click here for mail. Tell me what you do and how this might help you. I apologize in advance if I can’t fit in everyone. It’s nothing personal!
At the second seminar, on the 28th of January, we’ll also convene in my office. This event costs $1,000. You can bring a co-worker at no charge. There’s a 100% money back guarantee… if you don’t think it was worth it, just ask and I’ll refund your money. (This is have never happened before, by the way). If you’d like to come to this one, write to me at sethgodin@yahoo.com and use the word PRACTICAL in your subject line.Click here for mailIt’ll probably sell out, so you should hurry.

How to get a Purple job,"this just in (names changed):
Mr. Godin,
I am writing to share a “remarkable” Purple Cow success.  Several months agoI was laid off.  Although my job search process was very good (i.e. ordinary)it was not achieving the desired results.   After hearing you speak inAtlanta I realized I needed to create a “Purple Cow.”   My first step was to choosethe company I wanted to work for and develop a strategy for creating my uniquecow.  During the due diligence, I found a blank greeting card that simplestated “Dare To Be Remarkable.”  Bill Wilson was gracious enough to provide mewith a signed copy of your book (as I couldn’t part with mine – you signed itoutside of 103 West), and the process began.  I sent the attached letter,with resume, and a hand written note using the greeting card to my potentialemployer.
Within a week, the first phone interview.  At this time he hadn’t read “Purple Cow” but appreciated the creative approach.  During the next interview, wemet face to face.  His copy of the book had notes everywhere!  The entireinterview was predicated on your book.  We incorporated our discussion of myqualifications into our discussion of your remarkable book.
When he called to offer me the job, he shared with me he was having a salesmeeting and there was required reading – he had purchased 25 copies of “PurpleCow.”
Thanks to your book, I have found a unique way to communicate with others.In addition, I have developed a highly effective “Purple Cow” elevator speech.
In recapping your book, those on the other side of the desk lean forward asI describe to them the essence of your remarkable work.
Furthermore, “Purple Cow” is contagious.  By my recommendation, my brotherread it and distributed it to his entire management team.  A friend read it andhas given at least 8 copies to colleagues and prospects.  I have shared myapproach with other friends in the job market, and it is working for them, too.Through both physical distribution and recommendation of your book it is inthe hands of many top organizations.  To name a few:  BP Amoco, Gold’s Gym,Pierre Foods, Maritz, Inc., a former CEO and current Senatorial candidate,Starbucks, and many more….
Thank you for helping me help others create their own “Purple Cows” and earna position with a Global 50 company.
Sincerely,

Are you an enthusiast?,"Depending on his area of expertise, an enthusiast cares about the answers to the following questions:
“Paddle shift or stick?”“SACD or DVD-A?”“Cherrywood or carbon fiber?”“Pho Bac or Pho Bang?”“PowerBook or iBook?”“Hearthstone or parchment paper?”“Habenero or chipotle?”“Linen or organic cotton?”
I’m an ethusiast. As you may have guessed, I am every marketer’s dream. I am an enthusiast in not just one, but a bunch of areas. I get magazines with names like The Rosengarten Report and catalogs from Garrett Wade.
Enthusiasts are the ones with otaku. We’re the ones who care about what marketers are up to. The ones who seek out new products and new corporations, the ones who go oops, sorry, another enthusiastic topic jumped in there Anyway, we are the ones that will spread the word about your innovation, tell our friends and colleagues about your new Purple Cow.
It’s not just consumer goods. Enthusiasts read the Harvard Business Review and get excited about a new consulting firm or a new technique. Enthusiasts read the classifieds at the back of Advertising Age to figure out which ad agencies are doing well. Enthusiasts decide who gets elected President of the United States.
Plenty of marketers have decided that they need to be obsessed with these otaku-filled piggybanks. Some of them have even rented, or better yet, collected lists of the most profitable subsets of these populations. And yet, most of them fail.
I think they fail for the very same reason you often fail in getting the enthusiast in your life the perfect Christmas gift.
Enthusiasts don’t want you to hand them a gift certificate. (They’ll figure out how to get the money for the thing they really want). Nor do they want you to give them a gift and say, “the man at the store said you’d like this.” While you may satisfy our short-term craving for more, you also remind us (the enthusiasts) that you’re not on the bus.
Enthusiasts are ENTHUSIASTIC! This means we want to spread the word. It means we want other people to “get it” as well. We want the organizations we buy from to be one of us, to care as much as we do about the experience and the products and the process. We want our friends and fans not just to buy us a stick-shift warmer for the Ferrari, but to research it first, to compare the different warmers, to understand the trade-offs and make the same (obvious) choice that we would.
When you take a chowhound to dinner (that’s what cheap but authentic restaurant enthusiasts call themselves), she wants to know that you care as deeply as she does about the choice not that you picked the closest one listed in Zagats. When you make a product designed for a videophile, he wants to know that you’ve spent as many hours staring at the flat screen as he does.
Visit Steve Deckert’s site atDecwareand you’ll have no doubt that he’s one of you (one of us?). It’s different than buying from some invisible technology conglomerate. That’s one reason it’s so easy for little companies like this to do just great with the early adopters with otaku. We buy from him because he’s like us. He’s an enthusiast too.
So, what should you do if you want to sell to an enthusiast? Or buy a Christmas present for an enthusiast? She’s not going to make allowances for low price or great service or kindness. She’s going to be picky. She’s going to be aware of the tradeoffs. And she’s not going to go easy on you. If she did, she wouldn’t be an enthusiast, would she?
What you’ll need to do, I’m afraid, is become one. If it’s important to you to deal with people with otaku, you’ve got to get some. Sad, but true.

Q&A,"I did a phone seminar with Soundview yesterday. Got plenty of questions at the end, and I promised to answer some of the extras on my blog. So here goes:
How can the “Purple Cow” be used in a service industry – ie:  mortgage banking?
Its unclear that most mortgage brokers have tools available to them to differentiate their business. In other words, its not the remarkable opportunity it used to be.
I think you win once you can offer a package of remarkable elements that are parallel to the core of what you do, but add enough value that by themselves they become worth talking about
Frequent flyer miles, for example, have nothing to do with flying and everything to do with choosing an airline. That doesnt mean you should offer frequent flyer miles, it means you have a problem that needs a non linear sort of solution.
What suggestions do you have for a job candidate?  How do you use your Purple Cow approach to market yourself to potential employers?
The first thing to remember is that you can’t be Purple at the last minute. You need to be Purple before you start looking for a job. That means doing a remarkable job at work (hence the amazing referrals you’ll get for internal jobs) and with clients (hence the unsolicited job offers). People who are remarkable in the way they deal with customers and clients and co-workers rarely find themselves unemployed for long.
The second thing is to fight the temptation to print 1,000 resumes and to submit yourself to the cattle call (no pun intended) that is the typical job search. Won’t work. You’ll get an average job if you do that. Instead, focus on the people with an otaku, the folks who are searching for a truly special hire. If you’re that person, it’ll happen. What usually occurs, though, is that average people are pretty desperate and try to persuade the hiring person that they are in fact, remarkable. They end up not getting the job because their references (yours are attached to your resume, right) belie their assertion.
So, it’s not an easy answer, but it’s this:be remarkablebuild a network of people who truly want to hear from youyou’ll find the job you seek.
Good luck!
What can large established brands do to make themselve remarkable?
There are plenty of brands like Hershey, American Express, Maxwell HouseCoffee et al that are selling huge quantities of product and keeping lotsof factories busy and people employed. How can they further increase theirtonnage?
Chuck at Ogilvy
Well, the good news is that these big brands have the cash flow and the market power to get over the hump and create new cows to replace their fading ones (American Express, for example, might be a fine brand but most of it is hardly remarkable). If they want to grow, they must figure out how to invent something that’s on a different trajectory than their existing brand.
The problem is that the organizations rarely if ever have the guts to promote and reward people who will champion remarkability and permission marketing. That’s because both start with the (correct) assumption that they are not omnipotent. Most brands with power insist that they can control the conversation and that they can sell average stuff to average people. Maxwell House should have been Starbucks. Hershey should have been Scharffen Berger. American Express should have been PayPal.
So, if I were the agency of record, I’d push to do more than just make more ads for the same old stuff. Instead, I’d push to be involved in product development, not just advertising. Ad agencies know how to do this right if they’d only try.
I work for a technology publication who has lead/competed in the market forthe last few years based mostly on quality content as its competitiveadvantage.  Now that our market is becoming more saturated, it has becomemore of a  struggle to keep subscriptions on the incline.  What is youropinion regarding competing on quality now that more of our competitors aredoing the same?  What steps can we take to making our quality product moreremarkable?
A great question! My answer is that we need to keep redefining quality. At the beginning, quality means remarkable. Over time, quality comes to mean boring, within boundaries, to spec.
I’d redefine quality at your organization to mean “new, fresh, Purple Cow stuff that clients and users want to talk about.” Rolling Stone (which is/was quality journalism by most measures) fell into this trap in a big way.
Our Corporation is a $110m Federal Systems Integrator who receives substantial coop funds.  We are using radio as one of our key strategies.  We get lots of buzz by placing ads in the 7-8am timeframe.
My question is, “with 30 second and many 10 second slots to support the 30 second slots, what radio spots do you think are remarkable?  Why?”
I think the best use of radio is to create an audience of people who want to hear the full message. To touch millions in a socially acceptable way and get a bunch to raise their hands by emailing you or calling you to ask for more info. Hooked on Phonics (1 800 ABCDEFG) is a great example of this.
and the last one:
How do you find the sneezers?  Do you think that offering people discounts will help you get at the sneezers?
Actually, I think the sneezers find you. They find you because you hang out where they hang out. If you’re launching a product that doesn’t have a natural hive of sneezers, that’s really hard, but generally you’re clever enough to find the right nexus. Starbucks didn’t open the first shops in rural South Dakota, even though storefronts are cheap there. Apple opens their stores using similar thinking. Software guys realize that a post to Slashdot is worth more than ten ads in Time magazine…",,"Purple Cow, remarkability, differentiation"
True story (about the power of marketing),"Today at the supermarket, a woman asked me to reach up to a high shelf to grab her a one ounce bag of Atkins brands crunchy chips. Probably $2 a bag, which works out to $32 a pound.
She looked at the bag, saw the label on the front that said, “Only 5 carbs” and then asked me to put it back.
She apologized, and said that her limit was 4.
Wow.
Here’s a person who didn’t even know what a carbohydrate was six months ago who has been so swayed by the Atkins idea that she’s now too puritanical to even eat the Atkins-branded products.

In fact, most entrepreneurs who say they don’t have the resources to launch their purple cow (and are worried that someone will steal their idea) can learn a big lesson here. Her idea is likely to catch on (if the interest is any indication) which means that someone will either license it or rip her off.

The problem with anonymous (part VII),"Virus writers are always anonymous.
Vicious political lies (with faked photoshop photos of political leaders, or false innuendo about personal lives) are always anonymous as well.
Spam is anonymous.
eBay fraudsters are anonymous too.
It seems as though virtually all of the problems of the Net stem from this one flaw, and its one I’ve riffed on before. If we can eliminate anonymity online, we create a far more civil place.
How hard would it be to do?
What if the five leading search engines all agreed to create default setting that only searched pages that weren’t posted anonymously? You could always opt to search the larger, seedier web, but most users wouldn’t want to do that. Google news could skip the anonymous news feeds as well. Authentication wouldn’t be particularly difficult—it’s really hard to get an anonymous credit card, for example, so a fee of $20 or $30 a year ought to make a certification agency awfully happy.
What if the leading mail programs had a simple method to block all anonymous incoming email? In this case, the easy way to guarantee that email isn’t anonymous is to sell stamps for a tenth of a cent each. The average user might have to pony up $2 a month—and all that money could go to fund the work I’m talking about.
It’s ironic that we’ve set up two very different standards for our trust. In the real world, we’re skeptical of strangers. At the supermarket the other day, someone picked up my favorite brand of olive oil. I waxed on about how great it was, and of course, the shopper put it back and bought something else instead. Online, however, we’re happy to believe whatever image someone sends along, or buy something from a spammer.",,"anonymity, online trust, digital fraud"

(I wrote about this in 1998–when I claimed in Fast Company that banners were doomed by the year 2000. I was early, but not wrong).

Two great questions: #2,"“I guess this doesn’t apply to opthamologists”. I guess that’s not really a question, but it’s what someone in the audience muttered when I finished my talk.
OF COURSE it applies to opthamologists.
Remarkable marketing is the only way to grow. That’s not what they teach you at eye doctor school, but even doctors are beginning to understand that the health insurance free ride can’t and won’t last forever.
Medical care has operated in a weird twilight zone for a long time. Basically, many customers of health care don’t pay (except with their time) for the services they get. In a marketplace where people are fearful (they want the best, not something flaky) and where everything is free, it certainly appears that the best approach is to play it safe, to keep your head down, to force your product to become a commodity and just wait for your fair share of the business.
In essence, most medical professionals are focused on being reasonably well recommended and reasonably convenient. That keeps the waiting room full, and until recently, the coffers filled.
The problem (at least in the USA) is that health insurance doesn’t pay as well as it used to, doesn’t pay promptly and often (for more and more people) doesn’t pay at all. In other countries, doctors are compensated by their popularity, so there’s an incentive (though not as much) to get people in the door.
Bottom line: remarkable doctors (the ones that people talk about) can charge more, can see more patients and have more security.
Being remarkable is not about a better ad in the Yellow Pages. It’s about everything from the way the receptionist interacts with the patient (hint: receptionist comes from the word ‘reception’) to the way the doctor talks to the patient.
What’s become clear to chiropractors and dentists (who went first in the marketing game) is that the actual quality of the medical care is often secondary. The fact is, we have nothing to compare the medical to. We don’t know if a different doctor would have cracked our back better, or if a different eye doctor would have made our vision less fuzzy. What we DO know is how we’re treated, cared for, accomodated and talked to. And it’s amazingly easy to do this in a remarkable way.
The sooner you start doing this on a regular basis, I would have told my friend the opthamologist, the quicker you become remarkable.","February 2, 2004","Remarkable marketing, ophthalmologists, patient experience"
Two great questions: #1,"I gave a seminar at the library down the street yesterday. A fund raiser for a good cause. It was fun but I was nervous, because, after all, I’ve got to see these people in the supermarket and at school every day.
After I finished, there were some spirited questions.
The best question was in response to my story about my sister’s quest to create a remarkable resume, something that short circuits the, “Mail my resume to 1,000 companies that would scan it into the HR database and promptly reject me” approach to finding a job.
Sharon pointed out that in addition to creating a remarkable resume, my sister was also putting the recipient in a spot where THEY had to be remarkable. In essency, being ‘risky’ was the safest path for my sister, but didn’t it require that the recipient take a risk by interviewing her? After all, they’d be breaking the rules by voiding the faceless HR shredder.
“Of course,” I grinned. “You’ve got it!” Sharon had cut through a lot of my blather and gotten to the essence of the Purple Cow. The only way you’re product or service grows is when people who are willing to color outside of the lines take a chance on it. The only way you get a job interview outside of the status quo is when an interviewer takes a chance on it.
The thing is: if someone isn’t willing to take a chance, YOU’RE GOING TO FAIL ANYWAY. Krispy Kreme grew when people willing to take a flyer on a new donut bit one. The folks who were Dunkin Donut fans, unwilling to try a taste of something new are invisible no matter what, right?
In other words, the only growth, the only breakthroughs, the only new customers and great jobs come from people/customers willing to go out on a limb a little bit. So WHY NOT cater to those people from the start?
If you cater to the ignoring masses, they will ignore you. That’s what they do.",,"resume, risk-taking, growth"

i thought of another Free Prize for you:
on the corner of 1st avenue and sixth street, there are these two indianrestaurants that are mirror images of one another – both are atop thesame steps up from the street; both have the exact same (ridiculous)red-pepper-christmas-light decorations. one is to the left of the stairs,one to the right.
the Free Prize is, when you walk up the stairs, two guys burst out of therestaurant doors and loudly try to coax you, as you walk up the stairs,to go into their restaurant. whichever one you *don’t* choose gives you areally dispirited look. quite entertaining.

Incoming “personal” notes from people two or three handshakes away are now insisting that I help format PowerPoint presentations, introduce them to just the right hiring executive, contribute to their next project or drag myself downtown for lunch to discuss how I might give them some advice.
The beauty of the web is that it introduces us to thousands of people that might never have crossed our path. The problem, it’s becoming ever more clear, is that friction is rapidly disappearing. People who would hesitate to say “hello” at a cocktail party think nothing of sending a 1245k attachment.

Worth a thousand words?,"Art directing your brand (or you) is not a dumb thing to do. In addition to satisfying one’s vanity, it’s a chance to establish an image that might last a long time. The top half of my head, for example, first showed up in Fast Company and then on Permission Marketing. The time spent working with Brian Smale (a great photographer) clearly paid off in building the image of the brand.
No question, people look at pictures far more often than they read the words.
Which leads me to today’s New York Times.
When the photographer arrived, I had thought long and hard about what the photo should accomplish. I wanted to include my cow, because it’s a great connection to the Purple Cow book. I figured it would be fun to have my Gandhi/Apple poster, because it’s quirky and positions my ideas a bit.

Janet Jackson is about to perform on Good Morning America, and of course, the network is insisting on a tape delay so that they can bleep her or blank her if she misbehaves.Reuters | Breaking News from Around the Globe
Perhaps she should perform in a burka.
Whether or not you were shocked (shocked!) at the improprieties she demonstrated at the Super Bowl, there’s really no reason to assume that every single time she goes on television she’s going to expose one part or another, any more than there’s reason to believe that Howard Dean is going to start screaming or that your Audi is going to suddenly accelerate and run over the kid down the street.
Humans are really bad at extrapolating, which is why brands work and you should care a lot about making a significant first impression you can live with.
Janet Jackson was a third-rate brand. Michael’s sister, okay singer, hit record maker, decent dancer. Nothing exceptional, no “Mona Lisa” only-one-in-the-world qualities to her. Until February. Now she’s got that scarlet letter. She’s been branded. Possibly forever.
Of course, now that she’s got the brand, she’s actually LESS likely to start parading around naked on morning television, right? But playing to the brand is easy and fun and safe, so the folks at ABC institute the bleeping delay, just to be safe.

Here’s the thing: differentiation means thinking very hard about the market and your competitors and somehow making yourself different. Any rational person spending a fair amount of time with perfect information will have no trouble figuring out why you’re different.
Segmentation is a variation of that, but it involves breaking the audience into pieces you invent, and then differentiating yourself for that segment.

Both assume that people care about you.
Both don’t work the way they used to.

I think we need a search engine that does a great job on the 2,000 most common search phrases. Handbuilt, useful answers to bad searches. Better still, why not train the search engine to ask clarifying questions after you’ve done a bad search?

“Hi, guys. You look like your luggage is lost. I’m really sorry. Would everyone in the family like a lollipop?”
What would happen if every single AA rep said that (with as much sincerity as they could muster) when each rightfully annoyed person walked in?

Third, Google’s big chance:What if Google decided to make a Google account cost $1 a year, and you had to use a valid credit card to pay for it?
And further, what if your Google email address had to include your real name?
And third, what if a violation of Google’s anti-spam rules (I’m assuming they’ll have some) would cost $20 per incident?
Suddenly, Google mail would become a gold standard. People would happily let it through the spam filters. You could trust it. People would become suspicious of anyone who used any other non-google online email service… “what, you’re afraid of validating your account?”
That’s what I would do.",,"Google, Gmail, email validation"
The problems with April 1,"1. Sometimes you post a joke (see Nike riff, below) and people don’t get it. They either think you were fooled (which I take as a compliment–at least three of you thought I picked it up off the wires) or they get annoyed.
2. The world is so foolish, we confuse the real (gmail.com, for example) with a joke. Tons of folks thought there was enough flakiness in Google’s mail announcement yesterday that it was a joke. As I told Amit, though, Google is now too close to their IPO to fool around any more. Sigh.

The end of mass marketing,"For years, I’ve been writing about the increasing ineffectiveness of interruption media and the death of the TV  Industrial complex.
Today’s news, however is the final nail in that coffin.
Faced with consumer ennui and apathy,Nikehas decided to engage in a desperate effort to regain mindshare. By making a 7 figure “donation” to the JPL, they’ve bought the rights to the new planet Sedna.
Sedna, as you may remember, is the new planet past Pluto (which used to be a planet but isn’t a planet anymore.) Anyway, researchers chose the name because Sedna was an Inuit goddess who lived under the ocean (get it… cold and far away?). Nike, pointing out that while Sedna sounds like a brand name, Nike is actually the name of a Greek Goddess.
Hence the swap. I didn’t realize that the JPL was in a position to sell off the names of the planets, so expect some controversy over the proceeds. Either way, it’s sure to keep Nike in the news for months.
I think this is astonishingly stupid and arrogant. The backlash is just beginning.

The Curse of Great Expectations,"I can benchmark everything now.
I can benchmark my morning workout. The rowing machine tells me if today’s workout was a personal best. Even better, I can go online and compare my workout to the efforts of thousands of other people.
On my way to work, I can track my mileage. (My record is 89 mpg). Once there, I can watch the status of my books on Amazon, comparing their sales to every other book published in the English language… and then go check outJungleScan.com, where I can track the book’s performance over the last 90 days.
The problem with benchmarking is that nothing but continuous improvement (except maybe spectacular results) satisfies very much. Who wants to know that they will never again be able to beat their personal best rowing time? What entrepreneur wants to embrace the fact that the wait time at her new restaurant franchise is 20% behind the leader—and there’s no obvious way to improve it?
Our interconnected, 500-channel world lets us be picky. We can want a husband who is as tall as that guy, as rich as this guy and as loyal as my brother-in-law. We can ask for an apartment that is in just the right location, with just the right view and just the right rent—and then reject it because the carpeting in the hallway isn’t as nice as the one in the building next door. Monster lets us see 5,000 resumes for every job opening… and imagine that we can find someone with this guy’s education and that woman’s professional experience—who works as cheap as this person and is as local as that one.
In the old days, data was a lot harder to come by. You didn’t know everything about everyone. All the options weren’t right there, laid out in Froogle and compared by epinions.com. We didn’t have reality TV shows where each and every component of a singer’s presentation or a bridal prospect’s shtick were painstakingly compared.
Yes, benchmarking is terrific. Benchmarking is the reason that cars got so much better over the last twenty years. Benchmarking has the inexorable ability to make the mediocre better than average, and it pushes us to always outperform.
But it stresses us out. A benchmarked service business or product (or even a benchmarked relationship) is always under pressure. It’s hard to be number one, and even harder when the universe we choose to compare our options against is, in fact, the entire universe.
Of course, the boomers have this problem even worse (and we’re all boomers, aren’t we? Even if you’re not, we don’t care—it’s all about us). Boomers are getting older. We can benchmark our eyesight, our rowing speed, our memory or even our ability to come up with great ideas at a moment’s notice. As a result, we benchmark ourselves into a funk. We get stressed because we have to acknowledge that nothing is as good as it was.
In addition to the stress, benchmarking against the universe actually encourages us to be mediocre, to be average, to just do what everyone else is doing. The folks who invented the Mini (or the Hummer, for that matter) didn’t benchmark their way to the edges. Comparing themselves to other cars would never have created these fashionable exceptions. What really works is not having everything being up to spec… what works is everything being good enough, and one or two elements of a product or service being AMAZING.
So, I’m officially letting go. I’m going to stop comparing everything to my all time best, to your all time best, to everyone’s all time best. Instead of benchmarking everything, perhaps we win when we accept that the best we can do is the best we can do—and then try to find the guts to do one thing that’s remarkable.

A new brand of underwear?,"A funny post/review.
Snark Hunting : Naming Company Names Product Names Business Branding
Godin Plenty: Seth Godin’s follow-up to the best selling Purple Cow has hit the bookstores. Free Prize Inside is about how to create soft marketing add-ons for your product or service, like getting frequent flyer miles when you use a credit card or a “free” toy inside a Happy Meal. The names of his two latest books demonstrate a sense of naming much evolved since the release of his Survival Is Not Enough: Zooming, Evolution, and the Future of Your Company.
The name “Free Prize Inside” works on multiple levels, the key to generating powerful audience engagement. Also emerging, whether consciously or not, is a Godin Naming Architecture. A naming architecture is a set of parameters that govern the naming of future products. A naming architecture can be as simple as Ford’s “begins with ‘e'” strategy of naming its SUVs — Escape, Explorer, Expedition, Excursion — Or it can be more evocative, hence more effective, like what seems to be emerging from Godin’s dome.
Classically, you need three like-minded examples in a row to suss out the naming architecture strategy being rolled out. So at this point it is too early to conclude that the rule guiding the titles Purple Cow and Free Prize Inside is: “Could also be names for a Victoria’s Secret underwear line.” If, for instance, the next title is Nut Case, the rule would be “Could also be names for a Victoria’s Secret OR Calvin Klein underwear line.”","May 18, 2004","branding, naming architecture, marketing"
On thinking big…,"I just finished giving a talk to a group of 400 high-powered (high-leverage, high-paid) credit card execs. As I left the hotel, I passed a much smaller room, where a seminar for local CPAs was going on.
The snacks didn’t seem as good. The booklets weren’t that interesting either. apparently. But what occurred to me is that the folks in the second room were just as smart and just as talented as the execs in the first room.
The first group was enjoying the benefits of aiming high. They didn’t get these jobs because they were arguably smarter or had better connections or had gone to Harvard. No, they were starting with the same raw materials as the group in the second room. The difference, i think, was that a long time ago, the people in the second room had made a decision about what they deserved, or what they were capable of, or what they were going to stick with. And it was a bad decision.
No, not everyone should be a banking executive. But no one who aspires to be a bank executive should sell themselves short because of a decision they made a long time ago. In a world where the past matters a lot less than it ever did before, where it’s easier than it ever was to hit the reset button, it’s sad to see someone choosing to be stuck. So, if you want to, switch.

Forbes.com reviews the new book,"“Buy this book and use Godin’s ideas to remake yourself, your product or your company. Then pass it on to your boss or your employees. Tell them they’ve just won a free prize.”
Forbes.com: Read This (Free Prize Inside)
Thanks, Jean!",,"Godin, book review, transformation"
Forbes.com: Buy this book!,"It’s not a new message. It’s been said and acted upon many times and in many ways before. But Seth Godin has an attention-grabbing way of putting it. To achieve success now you can’t be invisible, you must be remarkable. That means your products and your company must have attributes that cause people to remark about them. One customer or potential customer tells another and so on, spreading the word until millions of people are clamoring to have whatever it is you’re offering.
That was Godin’s message to marketers last year in his book Purple Cow, which spent time on both the New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestseller lists. It’s his message again in his new book, Free Prize Inside: The Next Big Marketing Idea (Portfolio, $19.95)–but this time he’s aiming it at employees at all levels of a corporation, up and down the line. You, too, he tells us, can be remarkable and come up with remarkable ideas if you set your mind and energy to it.
The book, which arrived in my office inside a cereal-type box emblazoned with the words “Free Prize Inside,” is easy to read as well as inspirational. “Here’s how to do the work you must do to make innovation happen,” writes Godin, taking the reader by the hand.
The corollary of Godin’s message is that putting vast sums into advertising an ordinary product will no longer increase profits as this strategy once did. People are now so inundated with messages–noise–that they no longer pay attention. The dollars should go instead, says Godin, to improving the product itself, to making it address the customers’ problems more effectively.
He cites Jeffrey Bezos’ decision to put dollars that could have gone for advertising into free shipping instead for Amazon.com (nasdaq:  AMZN – news  – people  ) customers. The result: a 37% increase in sales and a long-awaited profit.
But how can the average employee make anything happen in a big company with layers of innovation-resistant managers? It’s not easy, admits Godin, but it can be done.
First, he says, think in terms of soft innovations. By that he means a free prize for the customer that doesn’t involve millions of dollars in research and development. One example is William Wrigley, whose company originally sold soap. Wrigley decided to provide free baking powder as an incentive for stores to carry his soap. When the baking powder proved more popular than the soap, he quit selling soap and sold baking powder. Later he offered stores free chewing gum with each can of baking powder. These days, of course, the William Wrigley Jr. Co. (nyse:  WWY – news  – people  ) is the world’s largest chewing gum company. The chewing gum wasn’t a gimmick, says Godin, but a free prize.
The difficulty of following this approach is that companies have a natural resistance to change. If you want to create a free prize, you have to champion the idea and that means sell it. If you’re not a power within the firm, you have to find a person who is and ultimately convince him or her that your idea is good and that you can implement it. Then you need to create a fulcrum to leverage it. Godin provides readers with a list of tactics to use in a variety of situations to get an innovation moving.
Godin recommends looking at what you are selling and, as he puts it, going to the edge. What’s on the edge of the product or service that could be turned into a free prize? He calls this “edgecraft.” Edges fall into numerous categories: ones that confound expectation, ones that satisfy real needs and desires, ones that address overlooked senses. He provides examples in each category. FedEx (nyse:  FDX – news  – people  ) is a company that satisfies a real need by saving the user an enormous amount of time. Krispy Kreme Doughnuts’ (nyse:  KKD – news  – people  ) products appeal to overlooked senses.
Buy this book and use Godin’s ideas to remake yourself, your product or your company. Then pass it on to your boss or your employees. Tell them they’ve just won a free prize.

The clowns respond!,"My recent Fast Company column about clowns brought this response. I like the shoes part best:
Seth, I feel I must set the record straight about clowns and clowning becauseI do not feel that you truly get what clowns are all about. As a professionalclown for 18 years and as a business person I feel that your analogy is farfrom accurate. Here’s why:1. I beleive that being called a clown is a great compliment no matter whatyour line of work! It means that you have a sense of humor and aren’t afraidto share it. Your derisive definition of a clown offends what I am and what Ido. I hear your definiton as meaning dumb, ignorant, stupid, etc…Clowns are far from stupid. It takes great intellect to see the humor in allsituations, good and bad. And I have medical benefits!2. Clowns are based on us, but not neccessarily about just what’s wrong withhuman nature, we also like to show what is right about it. We point out whatmay seem obvious. Some people can’t see the forest for the trees. We showthem the trees.3. Clowns do not ignore science. We use many of the basic principles ofscience. For example: in juggling we use the principle of what goes up, mustcome down. We also embody the principle that gravity does work! There isno “magic” that can fit 16 clowns in a car, it’s science, spacial relations!We use cetrifugal and centripital forces, inertia, roatation, revolution,momentum and many other great scientific principles and theories!4. Clowns do not argue with gravity, it is all too real! it challenges us,sure, but it always wins.5. Kodak shouldn’t be called clowns, they should plain and simply be calledblind business people with poor leadership.6. Clown measure their results by audience reaction. Did it make an impact?Did they get what I was tryoing to say? We are philosophers and commentatorson the way we all live our lives.7. Clowns are reality!8. Clowns plan ahead! We spend hundreds of hours practicing and perfectingour craft for the amusement of others. I personally have spent 18 yearsstudying and perfecting my craft and thousands of dollars. That takes carefulplanning!9. For the sake of the squirrel I’d like to mention that if they don’t planahead, then what is the purpose of storing nuts for the winter if not aplan???10. I believe that most humans don’t plan ahead and blindly stumble thru lifelooking for a hand-out.11. Clowns overreact to prove a point.

Some of the best working environments I have had were working with other realclowns. We are a team, we care about each other and work together to reach acommon goal: laughter. That sure beats any other business goal I can think of.
I think issuing red noses is a great idea! it would lighten things up andmaybe people would stop ripping ewach other appart. In stead of not beinglike clowns, maybe more people should be! It would certainly make people takenotice of how utterly ridiculous most arguments are and how working togetherwould be much more effective.

You’re very smart,"Here’s an example: you’re reading a blog, any blog. You know the blogosphere exists. Believe it or not, you’re among 10% of all people who surf the net.
This hit home when I was giving a talk at Eli Lilly. Before the talk, I mentioned a blog to a senior person who was prepping me. Here was somebody with authority, experience and, I would imagine, some online chops. Not only hadn’t she been to a blog, she’d never heard of one.
Listening to NPR today, I heard a bunch of talking heads ranting about Google. In particular, they were repeating the canard that Google’s gmail product somehow invades our privacy. It must, they asserted loudly, because the ads are contextual, which means your mail is getting read.
News flash! It’s getting read by a computer.News flash! Computers are already reading your mail! Spam filters, for example.News flash! If someone wants to read your mail, it’s pretty easy to do.
Yet the canard persists. I’m sure Google was amazed at how vociferous the irrational attacks on privacy invasion were.

Tradition!,"Last week, the family went to see a Broadway musical.
As occasionally happens, the star didn’t show up. An understudy took his place, and there was a slip of paper in the Playbill informing the audience that the second string star would be appearing.
The lights went down, the orchestra started, the curtain went up. A few extras wandered onto the stage. Then the main character appeared.
The audience applauded.
Why?
Why was the audience applauding for the understudy? Virtually everyone in the audience knew that the big star wasn’t there.
I’m sure that in the old days, when Gene Kelly or Audrey Hepburn appeared on stage, there was the gasp of recognition and the gratitude the audience felt that a big star had chosen to spend his or her valuable time with us, the audience. So the applause is a natural byproduct of that emotion.
Here, though, was an actor we hadn’t paid to see, an actor who was sure to do his best, but he hadn’t done a thing for us.
So why applaud?
Tradition!
There are too many choices in our lives. Too many brands of soft drink, too many kinds of cell phones, too many ways to fly from New York to LA. There are too many social choices as well–when to clap, how to say hello, what sort of message to leave on your cell phone.
As a result, more often than not, we resort to tradition. We do what we’ve always done because it’s safer and easier.
You should care about this.
You should care if you’re marketing an idea or a product that requires people to upset an existing tradition. Changing the way we do things (whether it’s the design of a bicycle or the structure of the Electoral College) is hard indeed. Realizing that being better is not NEARLY enough helps you understand the magnitude of your marketing challenge. In fact, traditions rarely change quickly just because the alternatives are better. (true story: Walking down Newbury Street in Boston on Friday, less than a block from no less than 20 great and cheap restaurants, I heard one tourist say to another tourist: “Well, we could have lunch at Burger King.” Why? Tradition!)
You should also care if you’re trying to build something big and important. Because big and important things often come from changing the tradition. And if you can invent a new tradition, a new tradition around your innovation, that’s when you win big time.

The Provincetown Helmet Insight,"Yesterday, I had a minor epiphany. More of an insight, actually.
Biking in Provincetown (a beautiful day, capping a Yoyodyne wedding weekend, which is more than you wanted to know), I mentioned to my wife that every couple we passed (straight, gay, lesbian, didn’t matter) had synchronized their helmet habits.
Either both wore helmets or neither did.
At first, I attributed the PHI to some sort of subtle evolutionary cue. People must be attracted to people with a similar sensibility about helmets. If you were a foolish daredevil, perhaps you could sense that in a potential mate. When you both got to the bike store, voila, you’d see that you both made the same choice regarding a helmet.
Further research at the store (including some surveillance and an interview with the manager) demonstrated that this was a bogus theory.
It turns out that what actually happens is this: a couple stands at the rental desk and the counter-person says, “do you want helmets… they’re a dollar each.” One person starts to answer, but glances at the other. Then a subtle form of bullying starts.
Usually, one person says, “no, I don’t think so,” and the other, who was about to say yes is intimidated enough to say, “me neither.” Sometimes, it works the other way, “Oh, we’d never ride without helmets,” says one, and the other agrees.
So?
So this is actually what happens to your product and to your service every single day. THIS is the  moment of truth whether you sell securities or consulting or yoyos or motel rooms. One person hesitates, the other leads and the decision is made. In a nanosecond, all your marketing and all your advertising and all your sales work is over.
What can you do about it?
Well, for a cheap and simple product like bike helmets, the answer is pretty simple. I’d create a momentum of peer pressure. Salesman: “Here are two helmets,” he says, as he hands the helmets to the two renters. “They only cost a dollar each and almost everyone wears them. It’s the smart thing to do.”
Now, since BOTH riders are holding the helmets, it’s easy for the helmet-inclined to take the lead. All she has to do is try it on (a natural thing to do) and the discussion is over. The salesperson is using the PHI to his advantage.
I think the same thinking works when selling a two million dollar consulting contract, though. The idea of working with individuals on the buying committee before the meeting, of getting each one to give you the benefit of the doubt, of discovering their favorite features or tesimonials, person by person, and then organizing that information for the committee is just like handing over the helmets. If it’s easier for each person to say, “sure, why not” than it is to say, “I don’t think so,” then you’ve got the PHI on your side. Just one little tiny push at this very high leverage moment can have a huge impact.",,"Helmet habits, peer pressure, decision making"
Cheaters (part 2),"So, I’ve gotten three letters (from three different continents) in the last week about Really Bad Powerpoint (see below).
They all say the same thing,
“I really enjoyed your ebook Really Bad Powerpoint, and I understand how the advice could be effective for [insert your own profession here, but something soft, like politics or the arts]. However, my work is quite technical. My peers [in the medical profession, at the university, at the VC firm] would laugh me out of the room if I tried to make my presentations have less than six words per slide.”
This, of course, is nonsense. In the paleolithic era–before PowerPoint–of course, there were NO slides. So if we start from the beginning and realize that whatever is on your slide is a BONUS, something that complements your words and your handouts, it gets a lot easier to see how this might help you.
The bigger issue, the one I can’t let go of, is this: If what you are doing isn’t working, why is it so easy to reject alternative advice? If a peer or a writer or a competitor can show you something that is working for others in different circumstances, why does human nature make it so easy to say, “sure, that’ll work for YOU, but my situation is totally different…”
The number of times you’ll find yourself in a completely unique situation at work is pretty limited. Unless you work on a nuclear submarine, it’s pretty easy to imagine that there are more commonalities than differences when it comes to communication, marketing and management. Time to loosen up a bit, say I, and give the alternative way of thinking a try.
PS I challenged one of the writers to send me a few slides. It was pretty easy to show him how straightforward it would be to rip out the bullets and most of the text… but you’re on your own, please don’t send me any more powerpoints!","June 27, 2004","PowerPoint, communication, alternative advice"

Brand Journalism?,"Stephanie Howard (Leo Alliance, Inc.) sends me this clip from AdAge:
NEW YORK (AdAge.com) — Declaring that mass marketing no longer works and that “no single ad tells the whole story,” Larry Light, McDonald Corp.’s chief marketing officer, said McDonald’s has adopted a new marketing technique that he dubbed “brand journalism.”
Speaking at the AdWatch: Outlook 2004 conference at the New York Sheraton Hotel and Towers, Mr. Light described the concept as one marking “the end of brand positioning as we know it.” He went on to say that effective marketing should use many stories rather than employing one message to reach everyone. In effect, he declared that McDonald’s was abandoning the universal message concept.
“Any single ad, commercial or promotion is not a summary of our strategy. It’s not representative of the brand message,” he said. “We don’t need one big execution of a big idea. We need one big idea that can be used in a multidimensional, multilayered and multifaceted way.”
He went on to define brand journalism, which he also referred to as a brand narrative or brand chronicle, as a way to record “what happens to a brand in the world,” and create ad communications that, over time, can tell a whole story of a brand.
# # #
My take? Yay for Larry for realizing that monthilic marketing is broken.
I worry, though, about two things:
1. changing the marketing without changing the underpinnings of the business is almost always a bad strategy. If all the people, the systems, the real estate, the factories and the menus are organized around monolithic marketing, slapping a little brand journalism on top isn’t going to work awfully well.
and
2. The marketer doesn’t get to run the conversation. It’s not really brand journalism that’s happening, you see. It’s brand cocktail party! You get to set the table and invite the first batch of guests, but after that the conversation is going to happen with or without you.
I have four irreverent ideas for McDonalds:
1. Start your own brand of lightly sweetened caffeine free iced tea. 10% the sugar of Coke. 4 times the profit. A brand you can own. A way to significantly impact the health of the world.  Phase out Coke. Completely.
2. Offer a free DVD of the award-winning SuperSize Me! documentary with every iced tea sold.[no, I’m not kidding].
3. Challenge every store to offer something new and real and local and remarkable on the menu. Diversify times 100.
4. Bend over backwards to host meetups in your stores. Keep up with the free wifi. Sponsor soccer teams and girl guides and the astronomy club. Put chess tables on the placemats. Use the real estate advantage to create a place where people meet.","June 17, 2004","Brand Journalism, McDonald's Marketing, Marketing Strategy"
"In the end, copy wins","“My Life” by Bill Clinton: Exclusive Extract!!!. Even with all the technology at our disposal, great writing wins out every time. This post is breathtakingly viral.
AFTER you read the link above, feel free to read the riff below.
I posted that paragraph this morning. This then, I’ve gotten a lot of mail from folks who wanted to know why I was shilling for Clinton and to let me know how bad his book is.
Folks! It’s a parody! It’s subtle, but truly funny.
My lessons?
1. viral stuff is often obvious, isn’t it? In other words, if you’re too clever, some people don’t get it and it doesn’t spread well. On the other hand, be too obvious and it’ll just sit there. It’s the fine line (sort of like the Tom Bihn launder tag) that makes something go. Obviously, I misoverestimated some readers.
2. brands don’t guarantee a virus, but they sure can get in the way. Clinton’s brand is so tarnished for a portion of the population that they’d likely refuse a cash gift from him. They certainly didn’t bother to read the post until the end… they just decided they hated him, it, and by extension, me.

I then clicked over to buy a t-shirt, and my I was delighted to see that they’re being consistent with their actions in treating it as not just a publicity stunt to boost business. What if they DID do it on purpose? I think the intent does matter. Or maybe it only matters to me… Anyway, Tom makes great stuff (I’ve been a long-time customer–I might even have the tag!) and all the proceeds go to charity.","June 11, 2004","Bihn Label, hidden message, charity"

Is the answer to trick people into getting spam?
My wife sent me a link at the LA Times. In order to read it, I had to register. Here’s the last part of registration:
Notice that the box ISN’T checked. That’s the universal symbol for, “We’re honest and we want genuine permission from you before we send you stuff by email. So if you want it, please check here.”
I was glad to see that. But then I read the text. It says that the UNchecked box means that they WILL send you spam unless you affirmatively CHECK it to say you DON’T want it. (Even without the ALL CAPS I’m adding, it’s still confusing.)
So, let’s be clear here: In order to ensure its future in a world where everyone is online, one of the great newspapers on the planet is relying on second order trickery (because ordinary opt out isn’t nefarious enough). Do you really think they’re building much of an asset here? Can you imagine that three years from now the publisher is going to say, “I’m sure glad we tricked a million people into having no leg to stand on when we busily spam them!” Hardly.",,"Opt-in, Spam, Newspapers"
Doing it on purpose,"What have we done?
The massive marketing engines of the car industry have decided to run roughshod over the idea of viral marketing and they’re working hard to manufacture ideaviruses as fast as they can:
AutoWeek – Car News
Why does it bother us so much when marketers try to subvert the ideavirus process and buy their way into our lives?
Precisely because it feels so intentional. Because it represents an unwelcome intrusion, a display of power… it’s a lot like spam, in fact.
When you run into someone with “Scion” tatooed on her forehead, it’s odd. When you realize that person got paid to do it, you feel used. Maybe it’s just me, but I think there’s a huge difference between the famousHonda Cog Movie(or the BMW movies)  and the manipulative Scion campaign. In the first cases, the car companies built something worth talking about. In the second, the manufacturer just bought the conversation.
With more than 55,000,000 downloads to date, the BMW campaign is a success by any measure. It’s hard to imagine that Scion can afford to buy enough “buzz” to make a difference. If Permission Marketing is about dating, then buying these conversations is about nothing more than prostitution.
(PS what aboutbzzagent.com? Yes, they get paid to help start conversations. But a key part of their business model is that they DON’T pay the sneezers themselves. The bzzagents work for free. It needs to be that way for it to work, imho).
Is it a fine line? You betcha. So is dating, for that matter! The magic and the art comes in creating remarkable products that don’t cross the line… they’re worth talking about, but they’re not paid conversations.",,"Viral Marketing, Ideavirus, Authenticity"
"Needles, haystacks & magnetism","Last month, I posted a bunch of notices looking to hire summer interns (yes, we’re set, thanks). The ads asked people to send in a three page PDF, describing their background, their goals and giving applicants a chance to really stand out and make their case.
This, of course, should be the dream opportunity for most job seekers. Instead of being treated as a piece of paper, a list of stats in a dry resume, here was a chance to actually tell a little about yourself.
HALF the people sent in a resume. Just a resume.
“Here’s my resume” was the total content of at least 20% of the cover notes I got.
Part of this is the result of being beaten down. Most of the system is about following the rules, fitting in and not standing out. But a lot of it, it seems to me, is that people are laboring under a very mistaken impression about what works–in life, in seeking a job and in marketing in general.
Most people, apparently, believe that if they just get their needle sharp enough, it’ll magnetically leap out of the haystack and land wherever it belongs. If they don’t get a great job or make a great sale or land a terrific date, it might just be because they don’t deserve it.
Having met some successful people, I can assure you that they didn’t get that way by deserving it.
What chance is there that your totally average resume, describing a totally average academic and work career is going to get you most jobs? “Hey Bill! Check out this average guy with an average academic background and really exceptionally average work experience! Maybe he’s cheap!!”
Do you hire people that way? Do you choose products that way? If you’re driving a Chevy Cavalier and working for the Social Security Administration, perhaps, but those days are long gone.
People are buying only one thing from you: the way the engagement (hiring you, working with you, dating you, using your product or service, learning from you) makes them feel.
So how do you make people feel?
Could you make them feel better? More? Could you create the emotions that they’re seeking?
As long as we focus on the commodity, on the sharper needle, we’re lost. Why? Because most customers don’t carry a magnet. Because the sharpest needle is rarely the one that gets out of the haystack. Intead, buyers are looking for the Free Prize, for that exceptional attribute that’s worth talking about. I just polled the four interns sitting here with me. Between them, they speak 12 languages. No, that’s not why I hired them. No, we don’t need Tagalog in our daily work…. but it’s a free prize. It’s one of the many things that made them interesting, that made me feel good about hiring them.

Are we all journalists?,"So, there’s now almost 3,000,000 bloggers tracked by some of the online services. That’s 1% or so of the active online population, and since it seems as though the number is doubling every month or so, it’s starting to get significant.
Remember how you used to curse journalists? Curse them for being lazy, or hyperbolic? How about this headline from today’s Independent (UK newspaper):
“First Night: Clinton takes to the stage for the ultimate sell”
Ultimate? What makes it ultimate? A $30 book is hardly the ultimate sell, right?
But choosing words, choosing headlines, choosing photographs… it all adds up. When the New York Times admits that it colored its reporting the wrong way re Iraq, we’re talking about a big side effect: thousands of people dead.
Now, everyone with a blog is a journalist. When you run a post accusing a politician of having no personality, for example, you’re indulging the public’s desire to elect a dinner partner, not a president. When you chime in on the day’s talking points, you’re a tool, not a new voice.
So, we come to the moment of truth. Now that anyone who wants to be a journalist CAN be a journalist, are the ethics going to get better… or worse?
I’m an optimist most of the time, but on this issue, I’m afraid I’m a realist.

Not sure which is more surprising…,"According to MarketingVOX, online media accounts for 12% of media consumption. That’s a stunning rise: one out of eight, up from zero in just ten or so years.
At the same time, though, they report that online media accounts for just 2% of ad spending.
This could be because online media doesn’t work (but it does)or that it’s hard to buy advertising in it (but it isn’t)or that it’s radically underpriced and a bargain (which may be true).
The real reason is pretty obvious: organizations hate to change. (so do people, but that’s a different story).
Whenever you are faced with a situation where your competition is afraid to change but you can see the reality of the situation, you have a huge opportunity. This is the biggest growth and market share opportunity in at least a decade.
Short version: corporations, politicians, non-profits and even individuals who overinvest in online will see the same spectacular bounce that companies saw from TV in the fifties and sixties.

The Cliff,"I got two different business plans from friends today.
Both of these guys are big thinkers, entrepreneurs through and through and destined for greatness. And both had precisely the same problem with their plan. It’s a problem that’s becoming very common… for products, for services, online and off. The problem is caused by our networked world, the quest for the Cow and the goal of reaching a Tipping Point.
In the old days, there was pretty much only one way to grow a business. Start small, make some money, get a little bigger, repeat. Over time, you could fund your way to bigness. VCs can help you jumpstart, sure, but raising 100 or 400 million dollars to skip all the steps on the way to bigness is rare indeed.
YOUR BUSINESS HAS TO WORK WHEN IT’S SMALL IN ORDER TO SURVIVE TO THE POINT WHERE IT GETS BIG.
A magazine, for example, can’t have a business plan that says it will accept no ads until it’s bigger than Time or Newsweek. I call this a cliff business… a business that doesn’t ramp up, but one that runs flat until, miraculously, the business hits critical mass and works.
In our networked world, cliff businesses are a sight to behold. eBay, for example, or Microsoft. Natural monopolies that work when everyone uses them. That’s one of eBay’s best assets–everyone wants to use the system that everyone is using.
The problem is, it’s almost impossible to bootstrap a cliff business. The Bluetooth standard, for example, is a great thing when every cell phone and laptop uses it. But it took more than five years of high-overhead standards-setting and meetings and commissions and committees before it even began to take off. Had Bluetooth been a business, it would have disappeared long ago.
The best cliff businesses online started with little fanfare (Blogger, or ICQ, for example). Doing it on purpose is difficult indeed. That’s one reason you don’t want your kids to grow up to be songwriters trying to write Top 40 hits. It’s a great gig if you can get it, but you can’t count on getting it.
So… if your product or your service or your business is going to be nothing but trouble until it reaches the cliff, I think it’s better to pick something else to launch. Something remarkable and cheap and likely to make customers and investors happy long before you get to the cliff.","July 29, 2004","business plans, cliff business, growth strategy"

This is a list of people that has never been rented, sold, harvested, compiled or messed with in any way. By any definition of spam (except of the one that matters… Yahoo’s) this is not spam.
But they say it is, so it is.
I’m not annoyed at their filter or even at the situation. I am disappointed, though, that spammers have had such an impact that email marketing (or even email notification of free online content with no money involved) is breathing its last.
Sigh.
RSS can’t come a moment too soon. It’s become more and more clear to me over the last five years that email is simultaneously too powerful (people who read it jump) and too weak (spammers have trained us not to read it) to last for much longer.","July 26, 2004","Spam, Email Marketing, RSS"
Are blogs backward?,"Newspapers come out every day. You read today’s issue, even if you’re new to a town and you’ve never read that paper before. The editors assume that you’re reasonably informed and up to date on “the story so far” and they just pick up where they left off.
Books, on the other hand, come out every year or five or ten. An author assumes that you’re going to start reading on page one. If she’s written a sequel, she assumes you’ve read the book that comes before, but a good editor will often push the author to spend the first chapter catching new readers up to speed.
Weblogs were designed to be like newspapers. The idea was that people would stop by and read some more every day, and that each post would build on what had come before… and that frequent readers would have no trouble keeping up.
This is great in a world with a finite number of blogs and a static community of readers.
Today, though, there are two factors to keep in mind:1. We’ve now got more than 3,000,000 blogs, and every two weeks (my guess) the number of people reading blogs for the first time increases by 10 or 20%. That means that most of the people who are reading your blog are doing so for the first or second time.
2. A lot of blogs are no longer about the original intent–to link to current posts on the web with small comments. Instead, corporate and personal blogs are much more focused on telling a story, a story that has a beginning and a middle, not just a current end.
This leads me to two thoughts:a. a lot more blogs should be posted in chronological order, like books. If you’re trying to chronicle something, it makes a lot of sense to start at the beginning, as long as you provide regular readers an easy way to just read the current stuff (That’s what RSS is for, right?). No, this isn’t right for gizmodo. But it makes a lot of sense for someone, say, chronicling her experience in a 12 step program.
b. we need Movable Type or someone to create a simple way to create “greatest hits” pages. Not an archive, but a simple way for a new reader to read the ten posts we want them to start with, in the order we want them read, before they dive in.
I know it’s weird to read a chronological blog. It’s worse, imho, to leave a great blog just because the last two posts don’t make sense out of context.",,"blogs, chronological order, reader experience"

Disappearing channel scarcity,"Just had brunch with my new friend Bob. He’s in the TV business.
Twenty years ago, everyone in the TV business believed in the three channel universe. Cable was a myth. That’s why the big networks did such a bad job of starting cable networks. They couldn’t believe that it was even remotely likely to succeed.
Of course, the first 20 channels did succeed. In a very, very big way. Billions of dollars worth of success.
It took about a decade, but the tv business recalibrated. They now believe that we have reached the natural number of networks and that’s it.
What happens, I asked, when Tivo has Java and TCP/IP and there’s a million channels?
The people in the TV business can’t imagine this. They can’t imagine a world where there might be 20 A&E networks, or where there might be a channel just for shows on how to build a model airplane.
XM radio and the Net just increased the number of radio stations by a factor of 100.
And today the NY Times reports that 175,000 books are published every year. And rising.
And we just hit 3,000,000 blogs, up from 100 five years ago.
The number of channels for just about anything keeps going up. The number of GOOD channels, where good means a built in high traffic audience that is non-discerning, keeps going down. The number of good newspaper PR outlets is down to a handful. The number of retailers with shelf space that really matters is tiny. Yes, you can get your thing out there. No, you can’t expect that distribution (or carriage, as they say in TV) is going to make you successful.

What is a Plog?,"I don’t usually blog about blogging, because it’s circular and boring, but Amazon’s home page is dedicated to their riff on the technique and I couldn’t avoid it.
Amazon.com: What is a Plog?
Aside from being an awkward verbal construction, a “plog” is just boring. All good blogs are “personal” in that they are about the writer. (good blogs become great blogs when the stuff about the writer is interesting and universal and the reader wants to read it). The whole idea of corporate blogs is difficult for me to get excited about, because they quickly become yet another firewall between me (a real person) and someone at the company (who I hope is a real person). Corporate blogs get stiff and scared.
Example? at the bottom of my plog it says, “E-mail plog-feedback@amazon.com to share your thoughts and suggestions on this feature. We’ll read everything you send, although we cannot promise an individual response.”
Well, Amazon’s plog (the P is supposed to stand for personal) isn’t personal at all. It’s certainly not personal about Amazon, and it really isn’t personal about me. It contains details about when my books are going to ship.
We don’t need to start corrupting the blog idea in order for Amazon to present a list of when my books are going to ship, do we? Can you imagine saying, “I need to head over to Amazon and check my plog?”
if it were me, I’d just announce that Amazon now provides RSS alerts. RSS is going to happen, and it will be a boon to Amazon to be able to cut through the email clutter. But a plog isn’t the answer, imho…",,"Plog, corporate blogs, personal blogging"

Maybe you shouldn’t ask,"Fast Company has a terrific cover piece this month about Jeff Bezos. My favorite part is when he talks about asking other people (experts, even) for their opinion about new projects.
Inevitably, people say no. Don’t do it. I don’t like it. It’ll fail. Don’t bother.
When I think about every successful project (whether it’s a book or a business or a website) the people I trust have always given me exceedingly bad advice. And more often than not, that advice is about being conservative. Or it involves focusing on things that will require a lot of work, rather than things that will make it remarkable.
The incentive plan here is pretty clear. If someone dissuades you from trying, you can hardly blame them for the failure that doesn’t happen, right? If, on the other hand, they egg you on and you crash, that really puts a crimp in the relationship…
I think the problem lies in the question. Instead of saying, “what do you think?” as in, “what do you think about Amazon offering 1,000,000 different titles even though some of them are really hard for us to get…” the question ought to be, “how can I make this project even MORE remarkable?”",,"Jeff Bezos, advice, remarkable projects"
More on Blended,"(this continues theoriginal post, scroll down below the irrelevant ketchup interruption. Whenever I post about ketchup or bananas, feel free to assume it’s irrelevant.)
When I was in college in Mass. years ago, we did a project with a low-level mafia kingpin (can you be both low-level and a kingpin? He was.) In gratitude for something or other, he offered my friend and me five-digit license plates.
“Why would we want a five digit license plate?” we asked. After all, it’s not like a plate that says GR8TGUY or something. It was just numbers. 43287, for example.
“It’s a prestige thing.”
He was right. Over the years, you always saw these plates on certain kinds of cars, driven by certain kinds of guys.
And the cars were another signal. Cadillacs meant one thing, little Cellicas meant another. So how do I explain the fact that just a few years later, I was hanging out with David Filo, multi-billionaire co-founder of Yahoo!, who was driving a Celica or some similarly non-descript econocar.
The people in first class are flying with frequent flyer miles, while the Senator is back in coach. The salesperson is busy pitching the president of the company in a meeting, while her purchasing agent, the little guy in the back, is the one with all the influence…
When the Internet caught on, the thing it changed the most was leverage. It gave speed and power and influence to people without a lot of other trappings. Blogs takes it even further… bloggers are entire media conglomerates in their pajamas.
So, when all the cues are gone, the way we make decisions about who to work with, what to buy and who to believe and trust comes down to this: it’s in the interactions.
It’s not the surface flash, the five digit license plate, the brand of car, the cut of the suit or the seat at the table. It’s in how we follow through. It’s in the actions we take and the way we listen. It’s in keeping our promises and doing exactly what we say we’re going to do.
Our prospects, though, are scared. They can’t afford to spend time or money with every single person that walks in. So the challenge is to be cheap and easy. If it’s cheap and easy (or quick) to interact with you once, people are more likely to do it. If the first interaction goes well, you get a second shot. You build a relationship, not a sale.
No, you never get a second chance to make a first impression. Far more important today, though, is this: you don’t get a third chance to make a second impression. And it’s the second impression that builds your brand.",,"Leverage, Interactions, Branding"

Blended,"All the cues we use to figure out who’s real and who’s not appear to be fading away.
Years ago, there were “real” books and self-published books. The real books were worth buying and reading, the self-published were from vanity presses. Today, of course, some of the best stuff is self-published, whether as a book or a blog.
The Republican Party just announced that it’s paying a 30% commission to anyone with a website who collects money on their behalf. That sort of tactic used to be reserved for fledgling startups or small grassroots organizations.
Multi Level Marketing used to feel just a little creepy. Vitamins or cosmetics got sold by MLM. Today, of course, it’s not surprising to hear about car companies or even doctors rewarding people with cash or services for referrals.
Wearing a fine suit that fits you right was a great cue to others that you were successful and powerful and about to make something happen. Today, it’s just as likely that your potential partner is going to show up in a turtleneck and jeans.
Hotmail accounts used to indicate anonymity and a little fly-by-night aura about someone. You wanted the email addresses of people you interacted with to have permanence… stuff like ford.com. Today, of course, gmail is the flavor du jour.
Having your headquarters in Manhattan used to be a sign of real success. People even made a business out of selling PO boxes at the Empire State Building. Today, you’re more likely to find aggressive, responsible companies sprouting up in Colorado, Dubai and Singapore.
The best websites (belonging to the best organizations) used to be designed by Razorfish or Organic or Scient. They were big and fancy and expensive and complex. Today, it’s not surprising to find a successful business with a one-page site that cost $300 to build. Even more surprising are the sites filled with direct marketing copy that aren’t scams… just effective tools to make sales.
Advertising used to be about expensive spreads in the New York Times magazine. Today, text-only Adwords ads on Google are the most likely to be paying for themselves.
Used to be that being public and traded on the NYSE was a sign of permanence and ethics. Today, after Enron and United and Xerox, it’s the previously unknown (and private) companies that just might be the best to do business with.
So, how do we tell the good from the bad? In a connected world where people don’t have letterhead, don’t wear suits (don’t even own suits) work out of tiny rented office suites (or their living room) have a simple website and buy only Adwords, have an answering machine not a PBX, don’t have a receptionist or a sculpture out front… in that world, how do we tell?
As we’ve stripped away a lot of the extraneous expenses and signaling mechanisms, are we in a race to the bottom (if “bottom” means raw, not bad)? I can no longer count on the best books coming from a major publisher, on the best articles being in the biggest magazines (in fact, I can assume that if it’s the cover story of a major magazine, it’s insipid). I can no longer assume that someone with a sketchy resume or a simple website isn’t serious about what they’re up to…
Ten years ago, there was a neat and orderly line for companies that wanted to go public and cash out. It started at Stanford and included lunch with the right venture capital guys. There was also a line for authors and salespeople and non-profit administrators and teachers and just about everyone else. Today, cutting the line appears to be the best way to get what you want.
[at this point in my riff, I’m supposed to insert a breathtaking insight, something that will turn your head around and make it all make sense. I’m not sure I can. I think maybe the insight is that puzzling times lie ahead].

Exactly.
I spend my days trying to make a point (or two). Trying to change minds. Sometimes, people are motivated by carefully shaded differences, delivered with reams of data by dispassionate observers. And sometimes it snows in Florida.
In my experience, many people get a concept stuck in their head and it grows to a size inappropriate to the original idea. I’ve met countless entrepreneurs and marketers who believe that one national TV ad, or one appearance on Oprah, or one lucky link in Google is the answer to their prayers.
Whether you’re running for President, running a non-profit or trying to go public, there is no shortcut. No obvious, easy, predictable solution that will get you the success you want. Instead, I’m pretty sure, you’re going to have to do a lot of work and build a measurable, predictable, improvable system that keeps getting better over time. And the miracles (that great link on Yahoo, that appearance on Air America) is just a bonus.
So, if I go a little overboard (as I did, intentionally, in my SEO post below) please cut me a little slack. All other things being equal, is an optimized website better than one that’s not? Sure. All other things being equal, is a check from Fred Wilson’s venture fund better than bootstrapping with no cash? Yep.
But first, you’ve got to make all other things equal. First, you and your colleagues have to do the hot, dusty and dreary work of building a permission asset one person at a time.

Jeff Cerny’s insight,"Did you ever notice that people tend toward two ways of thinking in the area of interacting with groups?
Whether it’s driving, cleaning up a common kitchen area, or the internet, people have an idea that being in a group either gives them greater freedom or greater responsibility.  Driving down the road, one thinks, “I don’t know that guy and what are the chances I’ll meet him anywhere?” in the kitchen, “this mess doesn’t have my name on it — someone else will clean it up,”  and on the internet, “if I get one person to respond, it will be worth all the irritation to the rest for whom it is noise.”
The other group of course, says to one degree or another, “I am a member of this group, and I have an obligation to treat others as I would like to be treated — I’ll let the guy go before me, clean up the mess, and not waste people’s time for my own minimal gains.”

The problem with search engine optimization,"SEO is the purported science of optimizing your webpage so that you rise to the top of the listings in Google and Yahoo!
The theory is that a huge number of people find what they’re looking for via search, that virtually all of these people only look at the first page of the results and that if you don’t tweak your page, you’re doomed.
I just got a note from someone asking me for a recommendation, and when I said I didn’t think that most SEO was worth the money, he asked me why. So here goes:
1. Because it’s a black art, it’s really hard to tell who’s good and who’s not. Andrew Goodman is good, there are people who are less reputable… no matter what, it’s hard to guarantee you’ll get your money’s worth.
2. my real problem, though, starts with an analogy. Imagine your retail store was on a road that no one ever drove down unless they found it on a map. And then imagine that they redid the maps every week and the mapmakers refused to tell you exactly how they went about deciding which roads to draw and in which hierarchy to place them.
Could you imagine finding investors for that sort of store? Could you imagine being confident enough in your ability to grow that business that you’d want to work there?
Lucking into (and it is luck) the top slot of a great word on Google is not a business plan. It’s superstition. It’s blind faith.
If you want to grow your business, you need a reliable and scalable and dependable way to spend time and money and have it turn into traffic and revenue. In the real world, companies do that with real estate and with advertising. Online, it’s about adwords and site design.
If you can figure out how to BUY (not luck into) keyword searches that bring you X number of visitors, and then you can figure out how to design your site so that Y% of those visits turn into customers, you win. And nobody can stop you from growing all you care to grow.",No date,"SEO, optimization, advertising"

John Battelle on upside down advertising,"John riffs on Ross Mayfield’s idea:John Battelle’s Searchblog: Sell Side Advertising: A New Model?
The short version: Imagine online ads that carry money and rules with them. If you’re a blogger or web publisher or even someone sending out email, and you fit the rules for a given ad, you can publish it. Every time you do, you get paid.
The ads deplete the money in their account and then vanish. If the ads are working, the advertiser refills them. If publishers find that readers like them, they publish them more often.
It’s upside down because control is now flipped from advertiser to publisher/reader.
Let’s go one step further and imagine that every ad knows who sees it (because we like the non-anonymous net). Then, of course, advertisers can pay more when their ads are seen by “better” ranked viewers.
I don’t think this works in the short run, though.
Despite the success of adwords, almost all advertising is bought regardless of its effectiveness. The bulk of ads are bought by giant companies that don’t measure and are afraid to measure. (Afraid, because if they measured, they might fail, and if they fail, they fear they might get fired…) Adwords scares them because it’s so entrepreneurial. This goes past that times 1000.

Time to take action?,"More than a year ago, I wrote this for Fast Company:
Here’s a question that you should clip out and tape to your bathroom mirror. It might save you some angst 15 years from now. The question is, What did you do back when interest rates were at their lowest in 50 years, crime was close to zero, great employees were looking for good jobs, computers made product development and marketing easier than ever, and there was almost no competition for good news about great ideas?
Many people will have to answer that question by saying, “I spent my time waiting, whining, worrying, and wishing.” Because that’s what seems to be going around these days. Fortunately, though, not everyone will have to confess to having made such a bad choice.

The new income that its products generate accounts for 0.5% of the entire GDP of Kenya. How? It manufactures a $75 device that looks a lot like a StairMaster. But it’s not for exercise. Instead, ApproTEC sells the machine to subsistence farmers, who use its stair-stepping feature to irrigate their land. People who buy it can move from subsistence farming to selling the additional produce that their land yields — and triple their annual income in the first year of using the product.
While you’ve been wishing for the inspiration to start something great, thousands of entrepreneurs have used the prevailing sense of uncertainty to start truly remarkable companies. Lucrative Web businesses, successful tool catalogs, fast-growing PR firms — all have started on a shoestring, and all have been profitable ahead of schedule. The Web is dead, right? Well, try telling that to Meetup.com, a new Web site that helps organize meetings anywhere and on any topic. It has 200,000 registered users — and counting.
Maybe you already have a clipping on your mirror that asks you what you did during the 1990s. What’s your biggest regret about that  decade? Do you wish that you had started, joined, invested in, or built something? Are you left wishing that you’d at least had the courage to try? In hindsight, the 1990s were the good old days. Yet so many people missed out. Why? Because it’s always possible to find a reason to stay put, to skip an opportunity, or to decline an offer. And yet, in retrospect, it’s hard to remember why we said no and easy to wish that we had said yes.
The thing is, we still live in a world that’s filled with opportunity. In fact, we have more than an opportunity — we have an obligation. An obligation to spend our time doing great things. To find ideas that matter and to share them. To push ourselves and the people around us to demonstrate gratitude, insight, and inspiration. To take risks and to make the world better by being amazing.
Are these crazy times? You bet they are. But so were the days when we were doing duck-and-cover air-raid drills in school, or going through the scares of Three Mile Island and Love Canal. There will always be crazy times.
So stop thinking about how crazy the times are, and start thinking about what the crazy times demand. There has never been a worse time for business as usual. Business as usual is sure to fail, sure to disappoint, sure to numb our dreams. That’s why there has never been a better time for the new. Your competitors are too afraid to spend money on new productivity tools. Your bankers have no idea where they can safely invest. Your potential employees are desperately looking for something exciting, something they feel passionate about, something they can genuinely engage in and engage with.
You get to make a choice. You can remake that choice every day, in fact. It’s never too late to choose optimism, to choose action, to choose excellence. The best thing is that it only takes a moment — just one second — to decide.
Before you finish this paragraph, you have the power to change everything that’s to come. And you can do that by asking yourself (and your colleagues) the one question that every organization and every individual needs to ask today: Why not be great?

And from the Russian judge…,"in honor of the Olympics, a Fast Company column from four years ago:
I’ve never been a big fan of the Olympics. To me, most of the pageantry is hackneyed and off-putting — and I’ve never forgiven them for not including Ultimate Frisbee as a sport. Most of all, what’s the deal with curling?
But one part of the Olympics that fascinates me is the torch relay that kicks off the event. Apparently a riff on some legend from ancient Rome (or ancient Greece, I can never remember), the torch relay involves carrying a single flame from one spot to another — preferably a spot that’s pretty far away.
Unlike every other moment of the Olympics, this one focuses all of our attention on a single person, a single detail. No multiple-event, three-ring circus here. It’s one runner, one flame. If the torchbearer falls, it’s a big deal. If she doesn’t make it to the next runner, she lets down everyone ahead of her in line, as well as all of the runners who carried the torch before her.
When people in the workplace confront shift, rift, zooming, and all of the other challenges that make up business life, there is one thread that runs through all of the choices that they make: Either they’re torchbearers, or they’re not.
In 2000, I spent some time working with friends at Flatiron Partners, one of the biggest Internet venture firms on the East Coast. Entrepreneurs think that the selection process used by VCs is a big mystery. They’re dying to know how VC firms decide who gets the big bucks and who gets nothing. The answer is surprisingly simple.
When venture-capital firms look for entrepreneurs on whom to risk their money, they aren’t searching for a great idea, or even great credentials. No, what they’re searching for is this: the certainty that the person who brings them a business idea is going to carry the torch for that idea as long as it takes, that the idea will get passed on, and that the business will make it across the finish line.
The really great startup companies in Silicon Valley, the ones that overcome every obstacle and manage to persist, even when it looks as if they’re going to fail — those companies are run by torchbearers. If there is one thing that separates Silicon Valley from almost any other place I’ve been, it’s not the technology, the traffic jams, or the lack of a decent Italian restaurant — it’s the culture. The place is teeming with torchbearers, with folks who are willing to take responsibility for carrying a flame.As more and more of us emigrate to Free Agent Nation, a place where more and more people are their own chief executives, the trend toward rewarding torchbearers will only increase. The biggest chasm in our society has become the gap between people who embrace the torchbearer’s responsibility to customers, investors, and companies, and those who are just there for the job.
A lot of folks whom I talk to speak wistfully about what they would do if they were “in charge.” I’ve got news for them: If they’re willing to be in charge, people will put them in charge! In my view, the huge rewards that we’re seeing for people who are brave enough, crazy enough, and talented enough to carry the torch for a new business are entirely justified. Why? Because there aren’t nearly enough torchbearers around.
In 1999, more money was spent to fund new business ventures than in any other year in the history of the world. Yet a huge amount of money sat uninvested, because there was no place to invest it. Are we really out of good ideas? No way. I’ve got a file cabinet filled with them, and you probably know of a few as well. Is there a shortage of engineers who are capable of implementing those ideas? Nope. There are plenty of engineers too.
So, if it’s not a lack of money, ideas, or engineers that is slowing down our shift to the new economy, what is it? Exactly the same thing that’s holding up your company’s transition to a new way of doing business — the absence of someone who is willing to stand up, look everyone in the eye, and say, “I’ll make it happen.”
Here’s how I know that I’m talking to a torchbearer:
First, torchbearers don’t make excuses. Our current economic good times won’t last forever. You won’t always be able to found a company and go public in less time than it takes to have a baby. At some point, the venture-capital funds will dry up. And, when those tough times come, they will present a perfect opportunity for the pretenders to fold their tents. Filled with vitriol and busy looking for a lawyer so that they can sue someone, these entrepreneurial also-rans will find a way to blame their troubles on other people. Real torchbearers run uphill with the same grace and style that they bring to gliding downhill.
Second, torchbearers often attract a crowd. People are fascinated by folks who are willing to carry responsibility. All too often, people add their own burdens to those that their leader must already carry — but, in any case, they’re usually delighted to follow along. And sometimes these folks are loyal and hard-working enough to follow a torchbearer uphill as well as downhill.
Third, most torchbearers don’t realize how unique they are, how powerful their role is, or how hard their task is. Even though they could make outrageous demands and insist on all kinds of special treatment, most of them are happy just to perform their role and to handle their task.
Fourth, torchbearers often care more about forward motion than they do about which route to take. You won’t find them tied up in endless strategy meetings, looking for the perfect solutions. Instead, you’ll find them out on the road, picking their way through boulders and weeds — moving, moving, moving, because they realize that moving is often the best way to get where they’re going.
Fifth, and most important, real torchbearers don’t stop until they finish. In the life of any torchbearer, there’s a balance between devotion to duty and the pursuit of joy. A torchbearer never forgets about or shortchanges a duty, even when that means postponing joy.
In established companies, the refrain that I hear most frequently is “Well, we’d be doing great if [insert person or department, along with pejorative adjective] would just get [his/her/its] act together.” Many previously great companies, both big and small, are having a lot of trouble dealing with all of the changes and rifts that the new economy is bringing to their doorsteps. Why? Because in many companies, the torchbearers have left the building. Either the folks in charge have forgotten what it takes to practice true leadership (after all, they’ve made it, the company has hit its marks, and now it’s “Miller time”), or they’ve left and been replaced by a different kind of management.
The point here isn’t that people in top management are unwilling to embrace change. The point is that the people who are busy pointing fingers and whining about “those guys” are demonstrating that they’re not torchbearers.
If you’re waiting for someone else to lead you to a better way of doing business, then reckon with this Olympic-size news flash: Settle in. It’s going to be a long wait.
All of a sudden, in every company in every country, torchbearers are in high demand. Everybody is trying to figure out where to go. And, much more important, they’re trying as hard as they can to find someone who will take them there: someone who will walk through walls and over hot coals, someone who won’t give up until the job is done.
Intrinsic to being a torchbearer is recognizing that you bear the torch for someone else. In our increasingly “me”-centered society, it’s easy to worry about increasing the value of the Brand Called You, while letting someone else carry your company’s or your investor’s torch. Torchbearers do both.In a small town in Georgia, a woman named Karen Watson faced such a challenge head-on. Several years ago, her friends and neighbors were complaining about the way that blacks in that town were treated. There was an undercurrent of racism, and, in particular, blacks were being tracked to lower-level classes in school.
For a while, Watson and her neighbors appealed to civil-rights organizations, waiting for some big shot to come to town and save them. Then it dawned on Watson that maybe, just maybe, nobody was ever going to come — and that the person who could make a difference was her.
So she stood up and took charge. She taught herself what she needed to know. She made a commitment. And the organization that she built, the Positive Action Committee, has made a huge difference in her community, generating change in several areas. Watson took responsibility — for her town and for her neighbors’ town. She is a torchbearer.
So could you be a torchbearer? Are torchbearers born or made? Here’s my guess: Many of us have the torchbearer gene, but for some of us, it lies dormant until something awakens it. Some parents raise their children to be torchbearers from birth. Others do whatever they can to persuade their kids to hide it. We’re certainly not organizing our schools or our society to reward children who demonstrate torchbearer qualities.
But I think that you can awaken the torchbearer within. I think that most people, given the right reason, can find the intestinal fortitude to carry a flame across the finish line.
Now, I’m not talking about working hard, or being dedicated, or putting your mission first. Being a torchbearer has nothing to do with how late you work at night, or whether you give your cell-phone number to your boss. No, I’m talking about the people with that rare skill, the ability to dig deep when the need arises — to get past the short-term pain and to pull off an act that few would have believed possible.In the new economy, people are doing things that have never been done before. Faced with the unprecedented, in an environment that’s unstable, many people say, “It can’t be done.” The torchbearer is the one who does it. Roger Bannister did more than set a record when he ran a mile in less than four minutes. He showed the world that anyone else could do that as well. He broke a time barrier, and he changed the way that everybody trained for a race.
Are you a torchbearer? Probably. The challenge is to find the right project, the right challenge, the right moment — and then to do it. Once you’ve shown that you can do that, the world will beat a path to your door.","August 12, 2004","torchbearers, entrepreneurship, leadership"

Time for another seminar,"Fall is almost here, and so it’s time to do another seminar in my office. This seminar will include half a day of serious indoctrination into the new rules of marketing (a la Purple Cow, Permission and Free Prize). But the best part is the second half, in which the focus is on you and your projects and your issues.
As usual, it’ll be limited to less than 30 people, and, as usual, it comes with a money-back guarantee.
For those intrepid enough to make the trek to Dobbs Ferry, NY (about 15 miles from NYC) I can promise a day chock-filled (what a great expression!) with practical insights you can use to transform your organization, your business or your non-profit.
The cost is $1,000, which entitles you to bring your boss too if you like. Non-profits get a 40% discount on a space available basis. People have come from as far away as Korea and Australia, and they tell me it’s worth the trip. Alas, I can’t bend the rules in terms of fees or colleagues, as it’s not fair to others that would like to attend.

Starting Over,"Imagine, for a second, that you’re China.
Over the next few years, you’re going to buy half a billion or so cars. Pave most of the country. Buy billions of barrels of oil… all the price of modernization.
The thing about China is that the government isn’t shy about being authoritarian.
So what if the Chinese government decided to decree what it meant for something to be legally sold as a car?
What if a Chinese car:–got 40 mpg or more–with low emissions–was small enough to fit into a parking space sized x by y (which is a number smaller than, say, a Buick)–had a built-in transponder to track stolen cars–had built-in cell phone capability–had a transmitter that alerted the local authorities whenever you drove faster than the emergency speed limit–had built-in baby seat anchors–had brights that automatically dimmed whenever another car approached–was recyclable–had digital key systems that made it easy to do car sharing–had insurance paid for with a gas tax–allowed local roads to ‘talk’ to the car about upcoming dangers–had a body that was ugly but easy to repair after an accident–had a transponder that broadcast when it was stuck in traffic and received inputs on how to avoid existing jams–had a follow me feature that allowed a car to be set to follow the car ahead (at low speeds) to increase the efficiency of traffic flow–ten other things I can’t think of but you can
How would that change the future of China? The definition of a car?
And what on earth does this have to do with you and your life and your career?
I think there are entire classes of products and services (from charities to political parties to cars) that are about to be completely reversioned. The accumulating weight of new technology, new networking abilities and ecological and economic demands means that incremental band aid improvements cease to pay off and instead, wholesale replacement occurs.
Think iPod. The iPod is not a better CD player. It’s part of a totally new system. China has the luxury of starting from scratch (though it appears, based on the sales of Maybachs and Land Rovers, they’re blowing it the same way others have), but either way, it’s going to happen to just about every industry.
Imagine the network effects that will occur when your industry gets networked and rebuilt and reinvented. Who’s going to go first? Maybe you.","August 4, 2004","China, transformation, innovation"

Three kinds of blogs,"The other day, someone was taking a look atJoi Ito’s Weband asked me what I liked about it. The subtext to her question was, “this is very different than what you’re doing… is it better? worse?”
As more and more people consider blogs for politics (cover of tomorrow’s NY Times magazine) or business or ego or as a hobby, I wonder if we need to get a little taxonomic here (Carolus Linnaeus – Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia). Forgive me if others have done a better job, but here’s my best shot.
There are three important kinds of blogs:
1. News blogs. These are the original model. The idea is simple. An author (or authors–seeBoing Boing: A Directory of Wonderful Things) chronicles the events of the day. This can be commentary on politics or news or dieting sites or merely pointers to interesting technology introductions.
Some of the most popular blogs are just carefully edited indices of the best of today’s Net. Others include a lot of pithy commentary on the part of the writer. News blogs are a fantastic solution to the noise filtering problem.
2. Writer’s blogs. You’re reading one. These are blogs that while they occasionally riff about today’s news, are mostly an opportunity for the writer to engage in an extended monologue. The monologue is influenced by reader feedback and new happenings, so it’s a lot more interactive than a book, but it certainly isn’t a conversation. I think this is a very new form of media (it’s a process, not a batch).
3. Our blogs. This is what Joi is at the forefront of. Our Blogs are blogs that are the tip of the community iceberg. A posting on an Our blog is nothing but a firestarter, a chance to start the conversation and see what happens.
Sometimes, it’s easy to assume that all blogs are the same, and therefore a blog isn’t the right solution for a given problem. At the same time, there are those in the blogging community who are upset when all blogs aren’t the kind of blog that they’re used to. I think it’s early days, and there are bound to be a few other types of blogs as time goes on.",,"blogs, taxonomy, types"
Less than a Decade,"I think some people are missing the two giant takeaways from this study:Study: More Net Equals Less TV. The first? It took only ten years to topple the most important, most powerful medium of all time. TV elects Presidents, sells cars, introduces products and changes the culture. It also sucks the initiative and creativity of entire generations down the drain.
Ten years is a heartbeat. This is an astonishing change in the way we buy and learn and vote and grow our businesses. I don’t think it has really sunk in yet.
The second? That the consumers who make the biggest difference (the busy ones, the ones who earn a lot, spend a lot, vote, talk a lot and change things) are the ones most likely to be online and least likely to watch TV.
Yes, Oprah is still far more powerful than Yahoo. But at the same time, Drudge and Jeff Bezos and Doc Searls are way more influential than their offline cousins.","September 24, 2004","media change, online influence, consumer behavior"
If someone steals your car…,"you call the police.
It’s a lot trickier in the idea business. (And more and more, that’s what we do, right? Invent and propogate ideas).
I’m on record as recommending that you do very little to protect your ideas and move as quickly as you can to spread them. Michael Cader’s Publisher’s Lunch Deluxe today points toDan Brown and Lewis Perdue — Dueling Da Vincis: Legacyan extraordinary indictment of the Da Vinci Code.
What’s so neat is that it is entirely possible that Dan Brown never read or was even aware of the Perdue book. That’s the thing about ideas… unlike cars, they go many directions at once and are quite nuanced. I bet that the books are actually quite different.
Other than gaping at the charts on this site, I’m not sure what you should do with this tidbit. Maybe just realize that if you’ve got a neat idea, it’s likely to be “stolen” one day (be prepared to live with that) and if you hit a homerun, you’re probably going to get sued (sigh.)","September 21, 2004","ideas, copyright, innovation"
More proof that TV is dying,"(as a mass medium, anyway)
From the Washington Post: “In fact, just one of the 13 shows that divvied up the 27 Emmys attained, in the course of the TV season, as many viewers as did Sunday’s Emmy broadcast. That one show was ABC’s own broadcast of February’s Academy Awards ceremony, which clocked nearly 44 million viewers; it was named best directed variety, music or comedy program.”
In other words, the biggest audience went to the show about the shows (same way Google has a far bigger audience than any of the sites it points to). And the Emmy’s had their second lowest ratings in recent history.",,"TV ratings, Emmys, audience decline"
Reality TV is the new Dot Com,"A friend told me yesterday that he had just sold a TV concept on behalf of a famous author he represents.
Uh Oh, I whispered to myself, I’m going to have to pretend to like another reality TV show. (good news, it wasn’t and I didn’t have to, cause it’s a great idea)
It appears to be trivial to invent bad reality TV, because, after all, it is.
Just like a bad dot com.
But in the middle of all this noise comes Mark Cuban.Mark Cuban to give away $1,000,000 in ABC’s new ‘The Benefactor’ series

Mark is smart and honest and a terrific guy. But most important, Mark Cuban is not afraid to challenge the status quo. I haven’t seen his show, probably couldn’t get my TV to work if I tried, but if you’ve got some time to kill, why not check it out?

Number Ten,"Certainly the most noticed from my recent list (below).
One reader writes, “I know you are busy so what I write bellow is just background to the question above. I am starting a business from the ground up right now. It seems that I cannot get in ANY door unless I know somebody. Please let me know your thoughts.”
Here’s why I wrote what I wrote…
When your idea is gaining traction, the easy and obvious and natural thing to do is to fear that you won’t succeed because you don’t know the right people. After all, we see Donald Trump getting in NBC’s door, and we see some famous author getting on a talk show or some rock star getting a video on MTV twenty years after he hit his prime… it just doesnt’ seem fair or right that all too often access is determined based on relationships, not some other measure of quality.
I’m all for the momentum that goes to a creator once she establishes a brand or a hit. But the facts belie this excuse. Microsoft, for example, almost always fails when they introduce something new. Most successes (in books, music, movies, politics, non-profits, etc.) don’t come from where the established wisdom tells us they’re going to come from. No one bet on Phish or Boing Boing or Google or Dan Brown.
Yes, it looks like the big guys (McKinsey, Steven King, General Foods) always manage to win, but what’s really happening is that the big guys slowly fade away and the real growth comes from where no one expected it.
In a world where things are viral, you’re more likely to succeed with passive networking (strangers recommending you) than the old school active kind.

"Trust and Respect, Courage and Leadership","[the last Fast Company column]
What would happen if your friends and colleagues treated you the way marketers do?
What if your spouse sold your personal information to anyone who would pay for it? If your boss promised you miraculous changes and then failed to deliver? If your co-workers refused to talk to you unless you spent half an hour on hold first?
What if the people you liked and trusted made promises to you in order to get your attention and cooperation, and then broke those promises whenever they could get away with it?
Most of us wouldn’t choose to work with people who disrespect us as much as marketers do. Most of us wouldn’t choose a career where everything we interact with is prettied up and dumbed down.
Why do we hate marketers so much?
We don’t just hate them. We ignore them. We distrust them. In fact, when a marketer actually keeps his promise to us, we’re so surprised we tell everyone we know.
I got a call yesterday from a company that wanted to “confirm my order”. When I returned the call, I discovered that there was no confirming… it was just a come-on from a company I had never heard from to sell me something new.
Somewhere along the way, marketers stopped acting like real people. We substituted a new set of ethics, one built around “buyer beware” and the letter of the law. Marketers, in order to succeed in a competitive marketplace, decided to see what they could get away with instead of what they could deliver.
As businesses have become commodities, many of them have decided that respect is the first thing they can no longer afford. If you’ve ever been herded onto a cattlecar airline, or put on interminable hold by a cell phone company, you know the feeling. One telcom executive confided in me last week, “after we sell you an account, we never ever want to hear from you again. If we hear from you, it’s bad news.” Hey, it’s just business.
The few successful marketers we hear about again and again (we hear about them so often, they seem trite) are all on our short list because they still show their customers respect. Apple, “Frasier” (the long-running TV show), the Ritz Carlton, Linux—none of them talk down to their audience.
The magic kicks in when marketers are smart enough and brave enough to combine trust with respect. When a marketer doesn’t frisk you on the way out of a retail establishment, or trusts you to make intelligent decisions, you remember it. The number of companies that keep promises to their customers, respect their intelligence and keep their promises, alas, is quite tiny.
Of course, this means that a huge opportunity exists. It means that if you seek the very best slice of the market (the individuals and companies that can spend money—wisely—on new things) you’ll likely do best if you eschew trickery and misdirection and pandering and instead focus on customers that will embrace a realistic and honest approach to doing business. RULE ONE: Smart marketers treat their customers like respected colleagues and admired family members.
The ironic thing is this: at the same time that marketers have coarsened commercial relationships, they’ve spread their ethical mantra (or lack of one) to individuals as well. At the start if this column, I asked, “What would happen if your friends and colleagues treated you the way marketers do?” Well, in many cases, it turns out that they do.
Now, apparently, it’s okay if a company reneges on a pension commitment. Now, if the contract doesn’t specifically spell out how one company will treat another, it’s okay to rip the other off as long as there’s a loophole. Now, apparently, it’s quite alright to treat your friends and colleagues the same way a marketer treats his prospects.
If an organization makes a promise, then keeps it, delight kicks in. If a manager or an employee or a co-worker takes an extra minute or jumps through an extra hoop to honor a commitment to you, it’s something you’ll remember for a long time—precisely because it’s such a rare occurrence.
So there’s the real opportunity… to follow in the footsteps of the great marketers by reclaiming the interactions that used to be commonplace. Have the courage to make promises and keep them. Do more than you promised, not what the contract says. Assume your colleagues are smart, and show leadership by respecting their work as if it were your own. RULE TWO: Treat your colleagues the way a smart marketer would. With respect. And keep your promises.","September 16, 2004","Trust, Respect, Marketing"

More on woot,"Jason McCabe Calacanis reports on the relationship between Woot.com andEngadget – www.engadget.com, a neat blog of cool, you guessed it, gadgets.
Obviously, the people who read engadget are big time nerds and high-tech fashion sneezers. The blog has permission to talk to people and authority when they recommend something. The big spike in Woot’s traffic happened in September when engadget moved from putting just “go check out woot” on their site to actually putting the product of the day on the engadget page. So, the blog is trusted, but not too much. People wanted to see if it was worth the click.
Jason reports that next Woot is going to give Engadget.com a five minute jump on the deal of the day. So, at 11:55 you can get a secret link from engadget.com to woot, which actually will make a difference, he says, because some of their products sell out in the first couple of minutes.
Going first is a free prize. For sure.","September 15, 2004","Woot, Engadget, traffic spike"
A modest customer service proposal,"So, the trend is pretty clear: move your customer support operations offshore to cut costs. After all, customer service is a cost, not a profit center, and if you can cut those costs, you win.
I can do that one better.
Just spent the last few days on the phone with HP, Creative and Maytag. Infuriating. Difficult. Time-consuming. In two cases, I “won” the discussion, but of course, both of us lost. In the other, they won, I gave up and don’t expect to return any time soon.
Here’s the plan:
Someone starts a service designed to cut customer service costs close to zero. The way it works: a computerized operation, totally turnkey, located on some desolate island with very low wages and very little English. Any firm with a customer service ‘problem’ can hire them–they can handle dozens of clients at once. The extremely polite operators answer with the name of the firm and use a database to keep track of all the information they receive. They keep people on hold for as long as possible (but not a moment longer) and then transfer them to someone else.
The goal is make the customer feel as though the operators are doing their best, but of course, to never actually DO anything. Keep track of the conversations and the record numbers. Keep transferring people. Promise to call back, never do. Sooner or later, the customer gives up and walks away. (If the firm does their job right, the customer blames himself, at least a little bit, for not being more patient.)
End result? Not only are operator costs saved, but you don’t even have to fix any products!","September 14, 2004","customer service, cost-cutting, offshore operations"

One more thought about the echo chamber,"If you’re defining yourself and your business in terms of your competition, you’re living in the echo chamber. Companies and organizations don’t grow fast at the expense of existing competitors. They grow fast for reasons that have nothing whatever to do with whether your service is 5% better or your product is a little more convenient.
You don’t beat McKinsey with better consulting advice, you don’t raise more money than the United Way by spending it more efficiently, and you don’t sell more widgets with a slightly longer guarantee.","September 6, 2004","echo chamber, competition, business growth"
The echo chamber (part 2),"Ask an undecided voter who Dan Quayle is and more than half have no clue. Ask them who Zell Miller is and the number drops into the single digits. (think about this for a second… how out of the loop do you need to be to be an undecided voter anyway?)
Yet, if the pundits on television are to be believed, what Zell Miller has to say is vitally important. Same with Dick Gephardt or John Edwards’ wife.
The pundits are there to spin for the people already in the echo chamber. They stick to their talking points and they busily keep score, just like the baseball fanatics with their box scores. But it really doesn’t matter and the networks are doing us a disservice by not featuring someone who can talk about the way the ideas spread, as opposed to what the ideas themselves mean to the insiders.
Howard Dean caused millions of words to be spilled while most people still had no idea who he was. Then, the moment with the very least amount of content (his famous scream) leaked out through the chamber and reached the public. And the rest didn’t matter one bit. What mattered was the idea that ultimately spread.
So, what does this have to do with you? Well, instead of worrying about the finest details of your competiton and our offering and your media buys, what really matters is this: who’s going to talk about you? What are they going to say?
Your prospects are just like the undecided voters. They are woefully uninformed, extremely difficult to contact and very prone to quick judgments and first impressions.

The echo chamber (part 1),"Have you ever been to a trade show? I’ve been to a bunch… mostly consumer electronics and books, but lately, a whole host of others. At every trade show, there’s a buzz about a few products or services. Industry scandals or breakthroughs or some new product that gets everyone excited.
What’s extraordinary is the huge disconnect about what people in the industry care about and what the public cares about.
Lots of insiders cared about the Tivo. They were astonished by some book or other. Amazed by a new pricing scheme launched by an industry leading consulting firm.
And no one in the marketplace cared.
It’s easy to get confused about what reverbates inside and what leaks out and spreads to the rest of the world. It’s easy to start cycling faster and faster on the inside the chamber It’s easy to spend a huge amount of time and money worrying about what the industry thinks or what features to add or what to charge. And then, after you’ve spent all that time, nobody notices.

What happens when it’s all on tape?,"It’s been twelve years since the videotaped beating of Rodney King started a riot in LA.Rodney King and the Los Angeles Riots.
In that time, the percentage of people with a video camera at home has increased dramatically. And the number of streetcorners and businesses that tape everything has gone way up as well. Steve Rosenbaum is trying to use that fact to change the way media is created:CAMERAPLANET
Odd segue: Today, in anticipation of a dinner party, I stopped at a lobster seller in Chelsea Market in NYC. I asked for a six pound lobster. The pricing at the store is $9.95 a pound for small lobsters and $8.95 a pound for lobsters six pounds and up.
The lobster weighed (I’m not making this up), 5.97 pounds. For reference, that’s just less than a pound by the weight of a penny. Feed the lobster a plankton and it would be six pounds.
He started to ring me up at $9.95 a pound. I pointed out the price breakdown and the guy shrugged and said, “It doesn’t weight six pounds.”
Two co-workers came over and with precisely the same uncomprehending grin, repeated his point. I added a penny to the scale but they weren’t swayed.
So, the two questions are, “Do you think the owner wanted them to act this way?” and “Would they have acted differently if they were on camera?”
I believe that the best motivation is self-motivation. That teaching people the right thing to do is far more effective than intimidating them into acting out of fear.
But I also know that people act differently when they think no one is watching.
I’ve been counting more and more mail from enraged customers (thanks, but I have enough!). These are people who feel outrage when they are deliberately mistreated by someone who should know better.
As the number of “owners” goes down (because the big chain outlets, telecom oligopolies and centrally controlled media keep increasing in number), it’s harder to find people who act the way we might like.
I wonder what happens once it’s on tape?
All as a way of asking you to bring your videocamera with you when you go to vote on Tuesday (regardless of which side you’re on). The biggest impact of the Net on this election, it seems to me, is that so many things are “on tape.” So many people are now embedded in the process that the process has changed forever.
Maybe if we all show up with a videocamera, other people will be reminded to act like citizens. Worth a shot.","October 28, 2004","videotape, media, accountability"

Is there a right way?,"So, I flew round trip to Toronto from New York yesterday.
In New York, they x rayed my shoes but ignored my digital clicker, cell phone, digital camera and assorted electronics. They also made me take off my suit jacket.
In Toronto, they ignored my shoes but took apart my clicker. They didn’t care about my jacket.
On the plane from New York, they said it was fine to use cell phones as soon as we landed.
On the plane from Toronto, they insisted we not use our cell phones, even though we were on the runway for twenty minutes.
So, which is it?
One of the illusions members of the reality-based community labor under is that there’s a right answer. That if you do X and Y, you’re most likely to get Z.

My best takeaway from this insight is to pursue answers that are inexpensive and easy to test. That becoming hysterical when one particular superstition is hard to implement is ridiculous.

On copyright and on spectrum,"Stop me if you’ve heard this before, but the Internet keeps bringing this pair of issues to our attention, and they seem to go together more and more often.
SinclairBroadcasting wants to use the spectrum (our spectrum) to broadcast political messages through its company-owned stations. Once again, regardless of our politics, I think we need to ask the following question:
“Whose spectrum is it?”
Computers have completely reinvented what we can do with a slice of spectrum. In the bandwidth your local CBS-affiliate uses, we could easily broadcast dozens of channels of digital information. We could create free internet access around the country. But it sits there, stuck, because the FCC licensed that spectrum years ago. Just because someone has built a business around it, should it stay that way?
What if we decided to use the spectrum in ways that benefitted everyone, not just media companies? For example, why not require that anyone broadcasting on the public airwaves devote one hour every night in prime time to public interest programming and commercials? With that much inventory, the cost of running for President could be driven close to zero (all your media buys would be free).
Which brings us around again to copyright, which always manages to get me in trouble. Whose copyright is it? What’s it for?
Why not have patents last 100 years? They don’t because we know that allowing a patent to go into the public domain makes it far easier for society to benefit… other inventions can be based on that first idea.
So why not make copyrights last for 5 years, not 100? A five year copyright would not dramatically decrease the incentive to make a movie or write a book, would it? Looking at my book sales, I can tell you that the vast majority of sales come in the first five years. Sure, JD Salinger would get hurt in the long run, but would that have kept him from writing Catcher in the Rye?
The purpose of copyright is simple: to encourage people to make stuff worth looking at and using. Not to protect the people who already wrote something. And CERTAINLY not to protect the companies that market movies or publish books.
Both cases are the same: our spectrum and our access to ideas are being held hostage by big companies who are dependent on the status quo. The ability of our culture to quickly evolve ideas and then to broadcast them to ever larger audiences is a fundamental building block of our success. Why do 98% of us sit around while big companies with no interest in us legislate against our interests?",,"spectrum, copyright, public interest"

The problem is that the AC site then responds more than 100 times (I counted) with a javascript error that says, “text input where number was expected [OK].” There’s no way to kill this loop… I ended up having to force quit Safari and then use a different browser to buy a ticket.
My concern isn’t that they’re losing some ticket sales, it’s that they don’t appear to know or care. That no one is benchmarking and simplifying and reality checking a site that accounts for a huge chunk of their revenue.

For a surprisingly long time, it was either the #1 bestselling ebook on the entire Amazon website or in the top 100. It costs less than $3. Yet, after 18 months of strong sales on Amazon, it has sold fewer copies than the paperback did.
Yesterday, we announced that for just two weeks, a ChangeThis edition of the ebook (Link:ChangeThis  :: The Bootstrapper’s Bible) is available for free. And in twenty four hours, it has already “outsold” the Amazon eBook and will quite likely surpass the printed edition within a week or so.
Can you make any money giving away an ebook? I think you can. I think you do when the idea spreads and people want to interact with you in other ways. And those interactions are the currency of the future.","November 16, 2004","digital media, ebook sales, idea spread"

A Little Like Francisco Franco,"Chris Busch wants me to wade into the “Is Branding Dead?” debate:
Link:Wired 12.11: The Decline of Brands.
Link:gapingvoid: why branding is dead.
Link:PSFK: Long Live Branding.
Here’s my take:1. The data are irrefutable. The number of massive mega brands and their value (in terms of the premium consumers are willing to pay) is shrinking, and fast. You can’t get as much extra for a Sony DVD player or a Marlboro cigarette as you used to.
2. The number of new micro-brands is exploding. Hugh (see gaving void above) is a brand now. If we define brand as a shortcut for a set of commercial attributes, emotions, stories, whatever, then any blogger with a following has a brand.
3. There’s a difference between brands and branding. Brands exist whether you want them to or not. Brands aren’t going to go away any time soon. Brands are a useful shorthand for a complicated asset within an organization. Branding, on the other hand, is a thing you do. And as an activity, branding is problematic. Branding is ill-defined, usually vacuous, often expensive and totally unpredictable. I’m happy to say that you shouldn’t grow up to be someone who does branding.
Doc Searls and company would have us believe that markets are conversations. This is a great conversation-starter and a useful piece of agit-prop. But the reality is that many many brands are actually monologues, not dialogues. That doesn’t mean a conversation won’t create a better, more robust, more useful brand. But, alas, most organizations can’t handle that truth. So they do their best to do it the old way.
Big brands are dying.Little brands are doing great.Branding is a weird gig.
There. Hope that riff helps my brand a bit.","November 14, 2004","Branding, Micro-brands, Market Dynamics"
Abraham Lincoln and the new Travelocity,"I need to fly to Colorado to go to a meeting in February. Do a Travelocity search on flights from EWR (Newark) to EGE (Eagle) and you’ll discover a bunch of tabs. The default tab is called “Travelocity” and my guess is that these are the flights they’re getting paid to promote. But it’s the default tab, so the results here are the only results you see.
A quick look at this tab shows that every single flight is a one-stop.
If you were clever enough to click on each and every tab, though, the fifth tab (American) would show you a non-stop.
I admit it. Travelocity fooled me. They fooled me because I used to trust them. I used to be able to assume that they’d just go ahead and show me the best flights. I was wrong.
Lincoln was right. You can’t fool all the people all the time. How much profit makes it worth Travelocity using up their single biggest asset–permission to talk to me about air flights?

News from Australia,"Acland Brierty writes:
Hi Seth,
Loved your books and now discovered your blog. I have one story to share with you today along the “free prize inside” lines. A friend of mine has just set up a backpacker hotel in Melbourne. In order to get backpackers to talk about their hotel here is the free-prize they came up with… GIRLS!… if they could attract girls to the backpacker hotel then the boys would follow.
So they went to great lengths setting up girls dorms and private rooms with good security and -get this-  pamper packs (moisturizer, masks, and other girly stuff). The boys dorms were pretty standard military affairs. The result was girls were checking in in droves to use the facilities… and the boys followed… as did the local boys as well hoping to get some Swedish loving.
So the place is packed out simply because of some hair products, face cream and foreign girls.
I have one more for you as well…
I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of Paddi Lund… he’s a dentist in Brisbane that shocked the dental world by firing his clients… he then halved his client base and doubled his profits and works half the time. You see, dentists have the second highest suicide rate of any profession. And one day paddi was going to work depressed as hell, and got to thinking… What do I hate about my business. The answer was most of his clients, the sterile environment… the whole drill, fill and bill process.
So he broke his clients into A, B and C clients. “A” clients loved what he did, paid on time and told their friends. C clients always complained, turned up late and bitched about his fees. So he wrote to all the C clients and told them to find another dentist. He then LOCKED his doors and put a sign up saying… if you’re a client, ring the bell we’ll let you in. If you’re not a client there’s a dentist up the road.
He then took an axe to his business and put in an oven and a cappucino machine.
Now here’s the best bit… The only way you could become a client of Paddis was someone had to REFER you. IN fact the referral bit was a condition of doing business with him. Before he would work on you he’d say… I’m going to give you the best dental treatment and in return I have one condition that you must meet… you have to refer at least 3 people to my business.
Paddi realised that getting A customers to refer their friends would simply generate more A customers… people have friends that tend to be like themselves… good payers etc etc.
He then had a Guarantee… the FREE PRIZE!… NO PAIN!… What do people fear most about dentists? Pain… by working with less clients and in a more relaxed environment he was able to take his time and that meant better pain control.
So that’s Paddi’s story… fired his clients, halved his workload and doubled his profits.
Interestingly, he has been asked to tour the USA many times sharing his vision of a FUN filled work place and has written a book about it.
Hope you have a great new year,

A new hierarchy,"Promise Phelon (The Phelon Group) sent over a white paper her firm recently did about a new hierarchy based on Maslow’s famous self-actualization pyramid.

My take? You start with something that does what you say it will. You add value when you provide swift support, but even better, when it becomes clear to a user that there are ways that the product can do even more than they expected. And finally, you win when you create mutually beneficial relationships. These are easiest to imagine in the business to business world (conferences, professional advancement) but you can also see how this could apply, for example, to an iPod. It starts as a music player. It becomes a calendar and photo book. And finally, it’s hip jewelry that gets you a date.
My guess is that Promise was thinking of something a lot more substantial than that, but in a society filled with people in search of meaning, it’s worth a riff.",,"Hierarchy, Self-Actualization, Value Creation"
Blog disclosure,"I wonder if the blogworld benefits if bloggers are crystal clear about their goals and influences?
For example, a statement like this:
This blog doesn’t accept ads or sponsorships. I don’t own stock or accept royalties from any company or product mentioned on this blog or in my books. I don’t serve on any boards. On occasion, I’m delighted to accept samples of stuff with very small (under $20 or so) value, just to be nice. I have to tell you, though, that there’s no correlation between mentioning stuff and whether or not someone sent it to me. I would change that policy immediately if Lotus sent over an Elise. I also go out of my way not to write about things if someone sends me a press release.
My goal in creating this blog is to spread my ideas and keep me from having to write a book about every single thing that pops into my head. I’m an amateur, not a professional.

The Music Industry: Aspen Report,"Every year, Jim Lewi does a conference in Aspen about and for the music business. This year, they asked me to come out and speak with them.
The conference is off the record, but one attendee (Bob Lefsetz) put together a summary (at times a little salty, so don’t read if your ears are sensitive) and sent it to some press folks. Here it is, unedited:
We’re gonna start a business.
Lewi’s a business book fanatic. To tell you the truth, I don’t believe in them. Except maybe Clayton Christensen’s. And, of course, the classic “Tipping Point”. Usually they’re written by self-declared wannabes. Or people who think just because THEY were successful ONCE they know all the answers.  Bullshit. So when Jim lobbied all of us to have Seth Godin speak at Aspen Live, we all said NO! But it’s Jim’s conference. He got Scott down to a reasonable price and overruled us.
I was wrong. This was the first time I’d heard a business speaker who GOT IT! Who I thought was on my wavelength. Who had something to impart other than his desire for a check.
Seth Godin said you’ve got to give it away for free. Since we refuse to charge.
Oh, Mr. Godin doesn’t think music should be free. It’s just that we should charge at the ISP level. Give MORE music for LESS money.
Shit, seems like EVERYBODY knows this other than the Big Four.
But, since the major labels are shooting themselves in the foot AND music is free, then you’ve got to sell a souvenir.
Wait a second. Music isn’t and shouldn’t be free!!!
If you believe that, you’re suing kids. Kids who know that the odds of a lawsuit reaching them are about as high as their parents getting videotape of them puking at the college mixer. FURTHERMORE, even if somehow the labels won, even locked down the hardware, there STILL would be no restriction on people giving music away who WANTED to. And people would STILL gravitate to this free music.
But since music is now free… You’ve got to sell something else.
Actually, at this point, to a great degree that something else IS the CD.
That’s what I think anyway, Mr. Godin wasn’t this sophisticated. I scratch my head and WONDER how we can still sell CDs to rippers and downloaders. Who seemingly only want the digital file. I’ve decided they’re TOTEMS! BADGES OF HONOR! A way to express your IDENTITY! AND, Seth DID say to do the math. That even if TEN MILLION PEOPLE got your stuff for free, if one tenth paid, you still were selling a MILLION COPIES! The majors have it all wrong. They’re suing Grokster to insure that their business remains small. No, the key is to BLOW THE BUSINESS UP! To have hit music on TENS OF MILLIONS of hard drives. But the majors can’t think that way. They’re like the hat business. All the businesses Mr. Godin had slides of. That went out of business. WHAT ABOUT THE STOCKHOLDERS someone chirped in from the peanut gallery? What about all those people who owned STOCK in the major labels? Well, the stagecoach company had stockholders too…
It’s all about permission marketing. Getting people to ALLOW you to sell to them. All the old wave marketing. On TV. It no longer works. Because of CLUTTER! Hell, I can see the same thing at MY HOUSE! I’m so INUNDATED with music that I listen to almost none of it. I need a REASON to listen. And it’s not traditional. Hell, even AIRPLAY doesn’t impress me. I’ve got to KNOW the person involved. Or else somebody NOT involved has to tell me it’s happening.  And these people I trust. The relationship isn’t built in a day. And it’s based on honesty. Ongoing veracity. And you overhype me once, break my trust once, and you’re done.
Oh, Seth told a great story about CD Now. You remember CD Now. They ruled the online CD sales world. They sent a newsletter of new releases once a month and response was INCREDIBLE! They were bought out/merged and the new money men said to send e-mail to customers TWICE a month. Business went up. Then ONCE A WEEK! Business went up further! Then every three DAYS! And CD Now went out of business. Because now most of their audience was IGNORING the e-mails. CD Now blew it. They busted up the relationship.
But how are you supposed to reach the audience? How are you supposed to break the next diva?
You’re not. Sure, every once in a while there’s a Celine Dion, but most times the center, the mainstream, is a money pit. You spend a fortune to reach those mildly interested.
Yes, mildly interested.
You’ve got to work the fringes. Where the FANS are. Let THEM grab hold.
And then THEY’LL spread the idea. Seth calls this an “ideavirus”. And the people who spread the word “sneezers”. In reality, it’s just different language from Malcolm Gladwell. What we’re talking about here IS the tipping point.  And connectors. But the key element is it’s SANS MARKETING! It’s not about beating people over the head, but getting your innovative idea out there. And hoping it catches fire.
And, you can’t short circuit the process anymore. Because the public has been street teamed to death. No, your only choice is to find something REAL!  Something SO hot that people will want to sell it FOR YOU!!
First you’ve got to get eyeballs.
We listened to Seth on Thursday. And asked questions thereafter. Then on
Friday, we attempted to come up with an outline of our business.
There were some who cringed when they heard the word “Internet”. ENOUGH ALREADY! We’re selling CDS!!!
But the Net is where the AUDIENCE is. The SNEEZERS!
Shit, just go to a house where teenagers live. PRE-TEENS! Right after school. FOR HOURS kids all over America sit in front of their computers and IM!!!  MULTIPLE PEOPLE AT ONCE!! WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY’RE TALKING ABOUT???
And it’s not only kids now. Even adults are starting to IM. And certainly e-mail has infiltrated the marketplace. We’ve seen a paradigm shift. GET OVER IT!
But then there were people who said that music couldn’t be given away for FREE! It DEVALUED IT!!! Sent the wrong MESSAGE!!
THIS was a head-scratcher. The MAJOR LABELS made it free. By REFUSING TO LICENSE!!!
Music IS free. ENOUGH with the re-education programs. What, do we live in a third world country? Where the government tries to repress a suddenly informed populace? People know the truth. That you can download just about anything. And you can’t really stop it. It’s only the MAJOR LABELS who disagree.
Yup, I’ve got to single out one Cliff O’Sullivan. Who stopped the proceedings to tell us that the lawsuits were WORKING! That majors were selling a PLETHORA of CDs. That they weren’t going to go out of business. That there WERE pricing issues, but they’d been SOLVED!!
Shit, sounds like someone who works for Zach Horowitz.
I don’t know Mr. O’Sullivan personally. Maybe he’s a nice guy. Then again, he IS quite intense. But STATISTICS tell us he’s wrong. The number of files being traded has GONE UP!!! Public perception is that music is overpriced.  And, the CD IS a souvenir. But it won’t be in the future. THIS is the kind of thinking that will drive the majors RIGHT OFF THE CLIFF!
Then again, Peter Tempkins had great insight on the lift the next day. Those leading the charge, those in front of the room facilitating the creation of our business were all ENTREPRENEURS! All people who could come to a decision and instantly EFFECTUATE IT! And almost ALL the naysayers worked for the man, the corporation. They couldn’t just say YES! There were higher-ups, policy, A WAY OF DOING BUSINESS! You just couldn’t throw the rule book OUT!
But that’s what Shawn Fanning did. That’s what most kids have done. It’s reality. GET OVER IT!
The key is to aggregate a TON of eyeballs. And gain their trust. And THEN to figure out how to sell them.
Yup, we’ve got that luxury. We’re not borrowing money from the public via Wall Street. We’ve all got regular jobs. We’re ALREADY selling things ourselves. But, we can SELL MORE if we can create a place where the AUDIENCE comes.  An audience that TRUSTS US!
Hell, build it and they will truly come. Not only Internet advertisers, but the record companies THEMSELVES! As I told the Board the next day, if we aggregate music fans labels will PAY US to GIVE AWAY MP3s on our site. Yup, they’ll argue about music being free up front, but once we’ve BUILT IT they’ll be DYING to play. Because it’s JUST LIKE RADIO! But BETTER! Because our constituency will TRUST US! And we won’t sell space to EVERYBODY! And if it comes directly from the major label, we’ll call it WEASEL HYPE OF THE WEEK! Because that’s what it is. But, we’ll allow the major label to sell it as hard as they want. With all the bio and historical info they’ve got. Although now it will have to be written WELL, be INTERESTING, since this isn’t newspaper reporters who don’t care, but TRUE FANS, who don’t want to be LIED TO! Who are HUNGRY FOR INFO, as long as it’s real, and it’s INTERESTING! Gain their trust, and they’ll be looking for YOUR COMPANY’S giveaways. And WE won’t abuse their trust by giving away A TON of your shitty music. We’ll only give away one track at a time. Not abusing OUR relationship with OUR fans/customers. Oh, we’ll give away stuff they WANT!!! We just won’t be HYPING THEM ALL THE TIME!!!
We finally got it together in Saturday’s meeting.
I’m not going to give away most of our ideas, because you could rip them off.  WOULD rip them off. Since you never had an original idea in your life. To think out of the box is ANATHEMA to those entrenched.
But the audience is yanking you from your perch.
The key is to throw in with the audience. FOLLOW THEM!
That’s the goal of our site. It’s not about beating THEM over the head, SELLING THEM. No, our site will be GIVEN OVER to the public. It’s THEIRS!!!!  We’re just creating the framework. Which we will adjust based on their feedback. But they’ve got a hunger. For what we provide. And we’re gonna provide it.",,"music industry, Seth Godin, internet marketing"

Voice recognition and change,"I heard on the radio yesterday that “scientists” are predicting the next big computer breakthrough will be voice recognition. Chips are getting fast enough that computers will soon be able to understand what we say. Which will make airports very noisy places, but that’s a different story.

Then I got home to discover that they’re teaching my third grader how to write in cursive.

Cursive is a fundamentally useless skill in this century, and if we were inventing the curriculum from scratch, it wouldn’t even show up in the top 1,000 things you need to know. Typing, on the other hand, is way up there, at least until the scientists come up with voice recognition.

Elephants! Doing the Impossible,"Margo Baldwin of Chelsea Green Publishing writes to me about George Lakoff’s bookand how she turned it into a bestseller. Thought I’d share the riff:
“When I teach the study of framing at Berkeley, in Cognitive Science 101,the first thing I do is I give my students an exercise. The exercise is:Don’t think of an elephant! Whatever you do, do not think of an elephant.I’ve never found a student who is able to do this. Every word, likeelephant, evokes a frame, which can be an image or other kinds of knowledge:Elephants are large, have floppy ears and a trunk, are associated withcircuses, and so on. The word is defined relative to that frame. When wenegate a frame, we evoke the frame.”—George Lakoff, from Don’t Think of an Elephant!
When told “Don’t think of an elephant,” not thinking of one is impossible.It’s impossible because once invoked, the elephant image cannot beunthought. That’s the short, sweet lesson about “framing” that George Lakoffhas taught us, a lesson that turns out to have enormous politicalsignificance, not only for this past election season, but for ongoingefforts to forge a new and more potent political message for the future. Itturns out that the Republicans have spent the last forty years or so makingsure they control the language of political debate so that their frames havebeen adopted by all of us — especially by the mainstream media. Think taxrelief; think partial birth abortion; think war on terror. Among otherthings, this control of language means they win elections.
In other words, it’s the framing, stupid!
The opportunity to publish Don’t Think of an Elephant! and get it out beforethe election came at the last minute, in mid-July. I had never heard ofGeorge Lakoff, but our roving editor-at-large, Jennifer Nix, through herwork with Don Hazen, the Executive Editor at AlterNet, put me in touch withGeorge, who sent us a proposal. You might say the rest is history, becausenot only did we get the book out in record time, but we managed to do theimpossible: make the book a national bestseller (New York Times, WashingtonPost, San Francisco Chronicle, Los Angeles Times, nearly every regionalindependent bookseller list).
I say the impossible because we’re a small, independent book publisher, nota corporate conglomerate media company; because we published the book in amere five weeks, from draft manuscript to finished book; because we did itwith no advertising budget or an outside promotional firm; and finallybecause two weeks before the publication date, we had no advance sales!
We did it by partnering with key progressive organizations, includingAlterNet, MoveOn, the Sierra Club, Democracy for America, the ApolloAlliance, the Institute for America’s Future, Green Festival, Hightower andAssociates, Anita Roddick.com and many others, who all helped launch thebook on the Internet. They sent out e-mail blasts and posted information onall their Web sites, and we gave them free downloads of the first chapter.Then, once the word started to spread, especially via the blogosphere andother word-of-mouth venues, key independent booksellers across the country,as well as the national chains, got behind it and made it the bestseller itis. In short, the strategy worked for everyone and got a criticallyimportant book out there at the right time and into the hands of people whowill put the ideas to work. In the end it’s about creating social change,and the reason it worked so well is that we all worked together; together wehad an impact.
It also helped that we made the book short, readable, and cheap. There arenot many serious books you can buy for ten bucks. But ten bucks seemed likethe right price. It meant that many people bought multiple copies to giveaway; it meant that many progressive organizations bought cases to sell orgive away to their members; it meant that we were able to get a copy intothe hands of every Democratic senator in the first days after the Republicanconvention; it meant that the book was actually read (Garrison Keillor takenote!).
So, where to from here? Well, first, of course, we want to get the book intomore readers’ hands. When the first post-election pronouncements of themedia were that the results had to do with “moral values,” the importance ofthis book for understanding what happened and what to do next becameimmediately apparent. Demand skyrocketed and we ran out of books within afew days. The New York Times ran an editorial about the book called “WhyDemocrats Need to Stop Thinking about Elephants.” Several publishing storiesincluded it as one of a few that would continue to sell strongly in theaftermath of the election. Columnists are continuing to write about itslessons for Democrats and progressives in the years ahead, and George isbeing deluged with media requests. So yes, it will continue to sell.
But second, and much more important, we’re helping to create a movement, amovement to take our country back from the elephantine forces in politicalcontrol right now. Take it back and move us all forward into a saner, moresustainable future.
So remember, do the impossible: don’t think of an elephant!

I wonder if the NUMBER of sites referencing something you’re searching on is the important number in selecting something to search for. PageRank doesn’t just rely on volume, yet the beta version does.

My quick take is that it would work a lot better if the suggestions were in order of page rank, not the alphabet.
PS Update: Robert Knutsson corrected me. It’s not really alphabetical order. It’s some sort of mystical magical selection. Makes it even more interesting, though I don’t get to use the Steven Wright joke.","December 11, 2004","Google Suggests, PageRank, Search algorithms"

If your front line people are unable to answer a “why” question, what do you tell them to do?
Most bureaucracies don’t want the whys working their way up the chain. Most bureaucracies encourage their people to be the first and only line of defense. “That’s our policy.” “I’m sorry, but there’s nothing I can do about that.” “Insurance regulations, sir.” The goal is to get the customer (questioner) to go away.
To go away.
They want you to go away.
Does that make any sense at all? The single most efficient (and lowest cost) technique for improving your operations is answering the why questions! You should embrace these people, not send them away.

The Yellow Pages was the Internet of its day,"And like the net, it “changed everything.”
The Yellow Pages receive billions of dollars in advertising money a year. It’s a great business model–businesses show their interest in getting new customers by buying bigger ads than their competition. Consumers choose the businesses with the biggest ads. The Yellow Pages wins.
The other cool thing about the Yellow Pages is that the ads AREthe content. The Yellow Pages without ads don’t exist.
So, check outGoogle Search: billiards near 10706. This is Google’s first shot at competing with Yahoo’s offering (Yahoo! Yellow Pages.)
Neither one works as a business, but both are a fine start.
The problem is that there’s no way for the consumer to tell one provider from another. Distance is fine, but most providers we choose aren’t chosen because they’re half a mile closer than an alternative.
If you’re a search engine, this is the next big thing. (note to Silicon Valley: you’ll need thousans of salespeople if you want to do it right).
If you’re a business that works locally, this is a bigger deal. Businesses that figured out how to use the Yellow Pages did GREAT (all caps are appropriate here). It was the difference between the big win and just getting by.
So, watch and learn and experiment. Here comes the next big thing.","December 5, 2004","Yellow Pages, advertising, local business"

I hear you. But I think the comparison is not apt. The right comparison is to compare our PDFs to books.

Reader Mail (part 1),"Maybe I’m typing too fast or thinking too quick, but a few people have written in re the Livestrong post below.
Here’s one quote:
Maybe people want to participate in the trend but don’t like the message on Armstrong’s bracelets.  Maybe friendship is more important than cancer to some people.  Maybe part of the proceeds for the friendship bracelet are also donated.  Did you look into that?
…
In all honesty, your most recent post lacks more decency than the guys making friendship bracelets.  Even Nike is cashing in on the trend, as they should.  I’d be more ashamed of all these guys for not taking advantage of an opportunity.
The others also took the position that if a marketer CAN make a buck and it’s not against the law, then he SHOULD make a buck. They also seem to feel that it’s not okay for me to call em on doing so.
Are there grey areas? Sure there are. This is not one of them.
1. it’s a cheap bracelet and no knock off is going to make a lot of money2. it’s enough to poison the well for the foundation3. it’s such an atrociously similar knockoff that there’s no issue here of fairplay or dubious intellectual property protection. It’s a rip off, plain and simple.
My point in the original post? Marketers need to stop trying quite so hard to exploit every possible nook and cranny, damning the consequences. There are consequences, and you are responsible for what you market and what you sell. It’s not the market, it’s you.

What you need to know about BitTorrent (part 1),"According to Business Week, only 62% of Americans know what a blog is. Either that or 62% don’t know. One or the other, doesn’t matter. What matters is that now you need another cool piece of lingo.
BitTorrent is what p2p file sharing was supposed to be. It’s a system that is totally decentralized. The more it gets used, the better it works.
Once lots of people start using it (and I imagine it will be built into browsers quite soon) the effect is this:Person A starts downloading a file by pointing to a ""torrent"" file on the web. This is not the data itself, just information ABOUT the file. It points to places where seeds (copies) of the file are available for downloading. The more seeds, the faster that person A can get going. It’s all automatic… the software does the work, not you.Person B starts downloading, but now they’re getting the file from the original seeds and from A, too.Person C continues the linked process, with all the seeds, plus A & B.
As a result, it’s possible to download, say, an hour’s worth of Apple Computer ads in high quality format in just a few minutes as opposed to in a day or two.

Microsoft has botched their ownership of IE, because they think like bullies, and you can’t bully consumers into doing what they don’t want to do. The idea of a Google browser is powerful from both a user and a commercial perspective, mainly because Google’s culture will make it work.

Warren Buffet on Gratitude,"Be Grateful
There are roughly 6 Billion people in the world. Imagine the worlds biggestlottery where every one of those 6 Billion people was required to drawa ticket. Printed on each ticket were the circumstances in which theywould be required to live for the rest of their lives.
Printed on each ticket were the following items:
– Sex– Race– Place of Birth (Country, State, City, etc.)– Type of Government– Parents names, income levels & occupations– IQ (a normal distribution, with a 66% chance of your IQ being 100 & a standard deviation of 20)–Weight, height, eye color, hair color, etc.– Personality traits,temperment, wit,sense of humor– Health risks
If you are reading this blog right now, I’m guessing the ticket you drew when you were born wasn’t too bad.Theprobability of you drawing a ticket that has the favorablecircumstances you are in right now is incredibly small (say, 1 in 6billion). The probability of you being born as your prefereable sex, inthe United States, with an average IQ, good health and supportiveparents is miniscule.
Warren spent about an hour talking abouthow grateful we should all be for the circumstances we were born intoand for the generous ticket we’ve been offered in life. He said that weshould not take it for granted or think that it is the product ofsomething we did –we just drew alucky ticket.

Sell Side?,"Fred Wilson talks about John Battelle’s “new” idea for sell side advertising.
It’s been around for a lot longer than you might think.
Commission Junction is one example (using affiliate links) but back in the old days (7 years ago) there was a lot of movement in this area as well.
Here’s how I see it:1. Advertising in a new medium is sold, not bought. It’s not a commodity, it’s an idea that gets sold to someone who wasn’t planning on buying.
2. Google turns advertising into a commodity, because it’s easy to measure and easy to buy. Once you get hooked on it, you want more.
3. It’s not just the click, of course. It’s the conversion.
4. Which means that there’s room for middlemen who will optimize clicks AND conversion for advertisers willing to pay.
And that’s where the future lies, I think. Something that’s a cross between what Fred’s talking about with www.cj.com. A whole cottage industry of people who figure out how to turn adwords into clicks into conversions.
Turning this over to outsiders is a little like using a rep firm to be your salesforce. You can do it, but to really win, you’ve got to do it yourself.
If it were me, I’d start a few competing groups within my organization and challenge them to “buy” customers as cheaply as possible. Cheapest group wins. If you get good at doing it in house, go ahead and start taking on clients!
And I’ll finish by reminding you of my biggest rant on this topic: conversion skills are worth ten times what clickthrough’s worth.

Care,"That, in just one word, seems to be the essence of good customer service.
There are tons of books about measurement and strategy and management techniques. There are people who will monitor your phone logs, or do after-sale questionnaires. The car dealers have people calling folks a week later to be sure the service was good.
You could spend all your money and all your time trying to improve your customer service through one fancy technique or another.
Or you could just care. And hire people who care.
Caring goes a long way. Caring shows up in your voice and your interactions and in your policies. Caring is the difference between a simple easy form and a three-page government interrogation. Caring is the difference between treating every stranger as a potential customer instead of as a potential thief.
Have you ever been to a restaurant where they care? Or a hospital? You can tell immediately.
When I went to the cemetery a few months ago for the unveiling of my grandmother’s tombstone, they were closed. On the window of the office was an 11 x 17 inch xerox copy (shrunk to a tenth of the actual size) showing the location of every plot. The copy was so small it was almost impossible to read. And the organization of the numbers was virtually random, so there was no way to find what we were looking for anyway.
They knew we were coming. There were only two ceremonies scheduled that day, yet there was no note.
My family spent an hour, in the rain, walking up and down and back and forth looking for the plot. No luck. All because no one cared.

Yes, it’s true. Online ad dollars are about to exceed magazine ad spending.
If you’re a magazine, this is bad news.
Magazines have lots of people and postage and printing costs. Magazines depend on traditional advertisers buying ads that are essentially unmeasurable, and doing so because they always have.
Everything is different on the web.
There are no incremental costs. People costs are much lower. And most of all, the ads are totally measurable.
2004 and 2005 are the years that the magazines of the future were/are born. And those magazines are unlikely to be print publications that figured out how to make it online. Instead, the new winners will be publications that figured out how to do what this medium is good at, instead of trying to protect a dying medium instead.

The Selfish American,"I was called to jury duty this week. (Key word being ""duty"".)
It was an extraordinary learning experience. In New York State, they’ve eliminated most of the automatic exemptions, so everyone is there–lawyers, doctors, sole proprietors, doesn’t matter.
This is one of the only times you get a look at your neighbors, unguarded, unadorned, completely random.
Here’s what surprised me:1. lots of people from two parent, single income homes2. very little sense of civic pride3. complete distaste for the legal system4. widespread cynicism about insurance5. most of all, selfishness.
I live in Westchester County, which is one of the most affluent counties in the USA. There was almost no one in the room who couldn’t afford to spend the two or three days that were required of them (that’s two days every six years). Yet the prevailing attitude was a wide and deep sense of self-importance. Everyone else should serve, just not me.
One dentist concocted an ornate story about a car accident twenty years ago–and how that had soured him on the fairness of the justice system (never mind that here was his chance to make at least one trial fair!) On no less than five occasions he tried to pull strings with a judge or a lawyer or someone to be freed.
As I spent the entire day sitting and watching, the ""new selfishness"" really became clear. I think it goes like this:
a. in the old days, public works were public. If you contributed to a charity or acted as a volunteer, your peers noticed and you got credit for it. Respected people were respected–at least partly–because they gave to the community.
b. in the last twenty years, the variety of ways to give to your community has increased dramatically. As a result, it’s hard to keep track.
c. a lot of people (respected people) have fallen through the cracks. Neighbors and peers assume that just because you’re financially successful, you must also be a good citizen, even though they can’t actually see that.

There in the jury room, people couldn’t help but revert to type. They couldn’t relax about this forced duty, to just accept it and do it gladly. So they radiated anger and distrust.

Rules for failure,"William Beatty was writing for amateur scientists, but it’s pretty global:
The road to failure often contains:1. Secrecy2. The conviction that someone is about to steal your idea.3. Focus on selling your idea to the government or a big corporation.4. Loss of humility and focus on fame5. Belief that scientists and businesses (the smart ones) will hail your discovery.

Just because it’s the bureaucratic thing to do doesn’t mean it’s going to work. In fact, the opposite is usually true.

The end of candor,"One of the reasons blogs worked so well for so long is that we could believe them.
One person, one blog, just the truth. The truth on the surface (it’s a simple interface and you’re not missing anything) and the truth a little below the surface (it’s a personal, authentic monologue).
There have been plenty of signs lately that this is officially over. Today’s Times drives that home:The New York Times > Arts > Pro-American Iraqi Blog Provokes Intrigue and Vitriol.
With corporate blogs and fake blogs and cia blogs and calculated traffic-driving blogs, it’s not authentic media any more.

In violent agreement!,"Danny Sullivan at Search Engine Watch writes,
“Search marketing is more than buying ads — SEO is the search world’s equivalent to public relations. It also doesn’t mean that you have to link spam, comment spam or content spam. Content-driven SEO — I’m writing more about this next week — is something anyone should be considering.
You can have all the great content you want. Neglect some basic things to make your site search engine friendly, and you aren’t getting in. It’s like saying that you need never reach out to the press, they’ll just somehow magically discover you’ve launched a new product, done something interesting. Search engines are better at discover, but outreach still helps — SEO is that type of outreach.”
While Danny might be surprised to hear this, I completely agree with him. I’m not a harsh critic of SEO, despite what you may have heard.
I want to clarify two things.
First, the entire Search Engine community is now more important than it was a year ago. By far. It’s now an “industry” the same way movies and TV media cabals have become an industry. No, there’s no Daily Variety and they don’t report hirings and firings in Entertainment Weekly, but the astonishing success of Google and of AdWords means that just about every organization is now concerned about what’s going on. It’s not just for geeks and tweakers. That’s a sea change from the old days.
Which leads to my second point. Just a short time ago, SEO was seen as a shortcut by marketers unwilling to do the hard work of actually making a product and a site that mattered. In that era, SEO was the quick way to get cheap traffic—cheap so you could afford to waste it.
Today, it’s different. The bar is higher. People have figured out how to make online offers that work. Once you’ve done that homework, it’s important (probably imperative) to streamline your site so that it works better with search engines. Why wouldn’t you?

Mob justice,"One of the side effects of the massively many-to-many publishing model that is the blogosphere is the following math:1. controversy is fun to write2. controversy is fun to read3. piling on is safe and fun4. undoing 1, 2 and 3 is no fun, hard work and easy to avoid.
When I was a kid, there was a fair amount of mob justice. A bunch of kids would spread a rumour, a posse would appear, ask no questions, beat the crap out of you and move on.
A friend of mine is now in a similar situation (and, as Arlo Guthrie famously said, ""you may find yourself in a similar situation…""). And the question is, what should he do.
If he takes the time to point out to those bloggers that they’re wrong, that they’ve taken one data point and blown it out of proportion while ignoring the facts (and there are many facts that they’ve ignored) he’s just adding fuel to the fire. ""Of course you’ll deny it,"" they’ve said to him on the phone, ""that just proves we’re right"".
Bloggers love a good fight. They love the give and take and the comments and the links. So my friend keeps his mouth shut and waits for it to blow over.
And it will blow over. Blogging is about speed, and no news is bad news if you’re in the hunt for an easy score.
So that’s the right way to deal with the mob, but it’s not fair. It sucks, actually. The mob wins and nobody learns anything.","January 13, 2005","mob justice, controversy, blogging"

How to Sell Anything To Anyone,"…in just one easy step.
Make something people want to buy.
Five years ago, when I first got to Yahoo, I was excited. All my life I’d been selling media… sometimes I failed slowly, other times I barely succeeded. I was pretty good at it, if you compared me to everyone else in the field, but it was by no means easy.
The Yahoo guys were different, though. Where it took my staff and me months or even years to make a million dollar sale, Yahoo’s salesforce was doing five or ten million deals every week or so. They knew the secret. They were supertalented, highly trained and very, very motivated.
So, now I was at Yahoo, playing for the winning team, and I was invited to go along on a sales call. I was vibrating in my shoes in anticipation.
You’ve probably already guessed the punchline. It was one of the single most inept sales presentations I’d ever seen. A lousy powerpoint. A non-charismatic, non-empathetic salesperson who faced the wall and read the fine print on the slides aloud. At the end of the presentation, he mumbled something about being able to take a check.
A few minutes later, the prospect handed over four million dollars.
Yikes!

The myth of the CMO,"I feel sorry for Judy Verses. She’s the Chief Marketing Officer of Verizon, a brand that is justifiably reviled by millions of people.
Is Verizon disdained, mistrusted and avoided because Judy’s not doing a great job? Of course not. She’s doing a great job.
The reason we hate Verizon is they act like a monopoly, have ridiculous policies, a lousy call center, a bad attitude, plenty of outbound phone spam and crazy pricing.
We hate Verizon because of all the things Judy doesn’t get to influence or control.
The myth of the CMO is the C part. They don’t get to be the chief of the stuff that is really what marketing is all about today. CAO, maybe (Chief Advertising Officer) but not CMO.
If I were the CMO of Verizon, I’d fix the call centers. I’d fire people with a lousy attitude who aren’t afraid to share it with a customer. I’d reward the great ones (like the installer who came to my new office last week) and figure out how to get every one of their thousands of people to understand that THEY are the marketing department.

Step by step,"This is so simple, but it’s costing you a lot of money.
I lost the keys to my Toyota Prius (actually, someone stole my shoes when I was skiing on the snow-covered bike path, and my keys were in my shoes, but that’s another story altogether–why would someone steal my shoes?)
Anyway, I go to Google and type in ""replacement key toyota prius."" (here’s the search:Google Search: replacement key toyota prius.). A quick check along the ads on the side shows that the second one, (advanceautoparts.comautopartswarehouse.com) has paid a lot to offer me a solution.
I click.
It takes me NOT to the parts for my car, but to the parts for all Toyotas (even though they bought the word Prius). I enter Prius and it takes me to another menu. No keys listed here.
I do a search for ""keys"".
This is what I get:

So, in fact, they don’t have keys for the Prius.
There are two problems here. The first is that the company is too lazy to buy just the right keywords.
The second is that the web guys are probably not the same people as the folks who are buying the ads. If they were, the entire online buying experience would be centered around me and my need for keys, not them and their need to accurately describe the hierarchy of their store.
Let’s assume for a moment that many businesses are going to grow or disappear based on how well they find the needles in the huge haystack of web searches… and that doing that well means efficiently turning that first clickthrough into a sale. If that’s true, then this means a much more measured, more customer-centric approach to turning mild interest into completed transaction.
This isn’t technically difficult (Link:Google AdWords Support: What are keyword matching options?.) It’s also not particularly time consuming.
What’s tricky, and the reason everyone doesn’t do it, is this:
You’re probably still working under a retail mindset.
The retailer builds a store. She stocks it. She arranges the shelves. She runs ads in the local paper and waits for people to come in who are ""just looking.""
This is not what happens online. (and I’m talking fundraising and just about anything, not just clothes or car keys).
Online you don’t have 1 retail store. You have 50,000 retail stores.
And you know what the customer is looking for BEFORE they walk in!
So send them to the right store.
And if a store isn’t working well, close it and start over.
PS If you’re a google shareholder (I don’t trade stocks) then this is really good news for you. Why? Because once companies increase their conversion efficiency, they’ll probably be willing to pay 400% more than they pay now for the right words.

The Walmart Paradox,"Getting what we deserve?
The New York Times > Business > More Gloom on the Island of Lost Toy Makerspoints out that the toy business is crumbling. The reason: all the stores that love to sell toys are disappearing, defeated by WalMart.
Walmart wants to sell classics and heavily advertised hits. And they want to do it at close to cost. This appears to be good for consumers–get a Barbie for $12 or whatever.
The problem is thatNEWtoys aren’t classics and it’s hard to make the bet that new toys should be heavily advertised.
The second problem is that once you reach the level of success of a classic, selling at cost is no fun at all.
The end result is that the toy guys don’t have the guts to launch the new and the remarkable. They are boxed in, encouraged by Wall Street and management to play the Walmart game, which leads to short-term revenue and long term destitution.
These toy companies have always needed the profit from their hits to fund their next generation.
So what’s the answer?
The answer is to tell Walmart to go away. Toy companies are beginning to discover that they can’t win this game. The answer is to find a new and better and more consistently profitable way to launch the remarkable stuff.
And that’s happening. It’s happening when they sell online, or through local stores, or directly to people who care. No, this isn’t mass. This isn’t a fraction of what an endcap at Toys R Us was worth. It’s still the best deal in town. Over time, consumers will be trained that the toys they need are only available in places that aren’t Walmart.
Obviously, I think this same mantra applies to plenty of products in a similar situation.

More on bad ideas,"I’ve gotten a ton of mails about my bad ideas post.
The bad news is that almost every letter writer misses my point. They want to have an argument about whether pull downs for states is a good idea.
Let’s say that there were no pull downs for states. And then let’s say someone invented it. Would everyone immediately adopt it because it’s so much better? Of course not. The reason it’s being defended is because of the status quo.
To save myself some typing, here are the reasons, if you insist, on why pull downs for states are silly:
1. No, you can’t just type the first letter of the state, at least not in Firefox on the Mac. And hey, a state is just two letters, so who exactly is being helped here?
2. If you really want to use computer power to help me, have me type in my zip code. Then the computer should look up the city AND the state and save me 10 or fifteen letters!
3. the pull down, even if it’s better, which it’s not, causes me to switch from one mode (type and tab) to another mode (arrows and mouse.) All for two letters.
4. there is no #4.
5. The biggest reason of all: half or more of all shoppping carts online are abandoned. If this happened at the supermarket, they’d be bankrupt in less than a week. This is acrisisfor anyone who sells online (except for Amazon, which doesn’t have this problem–because people don’t have to see any of this nonsense.) instead of Dilbertly defending the engineering status quo, teams should be working around the clock to test every single thing they can to fix the problem.

The persistence of really bad ideas,"There are fifty states (proof:Clickable Map of US States.) This is a problem. If there were 5 states or 500 states, programmers would never have been tempted into forcing consumers to scroll through a pull down menu to enter their state when shopping online.
This means everyone from Texas or New York or heaven forfend, West Virginia, has to scroll all the way down in order to buy something.
This scrolling led to a similar breakthrough to enter your country. Afghanis get a big break (so do people from Andorra) but those in the biggest online consuming country on earth have to scroll all the way down to the ‘U’s.
No wonder so many people abandon shopping carts online.
This is not a post about how stupid this is.
This is not even a post about how easy it would be to fix (it’s actually easier to put a text field in than the pull down menu).
Nor is it a post about how useless the precision here is. Knowing the state is not nearly as important as knowing the zip code, and the scroll down is unlikely to get you the right state every time anyway.
No, this is a post about how bad ideas stick around forever.
The reason is simple: in most organizations, you don’t get in trouble for embracing the status quo.
More than a hundred years ago, Kaiser Wilhelm wanted to get rid of his enemies in the German government. He noticed that they were all over 65. So he decreed that this was the official retirement age, and it still is.
If you want to see what happens when you challenge the status quo, just say this at a party, ""I know how to fix Social Security. Let’s just raise the official retirement age for everyone who is currently under fifty. We’ll take it from 65 to 70.""

Who decides? The New Middle.,"Marketing dollars are getting spent on product placement (Panasonic provides plasma screens to Tony Danza, Pontiac gives cars toOprah). Marketing dollars are also moving from magazines (stagnant) to adwords and online media (skyrocketing). Marketers are busy building viral campaigns, funding blogs, and yes, by the way, investing in products that are cool enough to actually blog about.
But who’s deciding?
My guess is that this is not an organized, top down effort led by the fancy CMO or VP of Marketing. I think it’s all happening around the edges while the middle (TV etc.) implodes.
This is accidental and random and it’s going to get ugly, fast.

"So, what will it take to succeed?","If it’s not money or brilliant programming (see below) what will characterize the success of tomorrow’s Net?
1.Relentless execution. This is far and away the winner. Persistence and focus and consistency. We saw how this worked for Amazon and we saw how getting distracted hurt AOL and others. It’s far more important today, because markets at rest tend to stay at rest. Changing the market is hard.
2.Resistance to compromise. Because you can do so much, so fast using tools, and because it’s easy for non-experts to chime in, the temptation is to go for the middle, to compromise, to be all things. It’s thePurple Cowthing again…
3.What youdon’tdo. This is a little bit like #2. Go take a look at an Amazon page. Now you can do a web search, search inside the book, order it new, order it used, on and on and on. The temptation is to do everything you can do (it might work for Amazon, but it’s not going to work for you!) The very best new Net companies understand in their heart and soul what they WON’T do.
4.Desire to be three steps ahead.One step is easy. One step isn’t enough. If you’re only one step ahead, you’ll get creamed before you launch. Two steps is tempting. Two steps means that everyone understands what you’re up to when you pitch them. Two steps means that you can get funded in no time. Two steps is a problem. It’s a problem because the smart guys are three steps ahead. They’re the groundbreakers and the pathfinders. They’re the ones inventing the next generation. It’s harder to sell, harder to build and harder to get your mother-in-law to understand, but that’s what’s worth building.
5.Doing something worth doing.Hey, nobody is going to switch to your service because you worked hard on it. Being a little better is worthless.
6.Connecting people to people. Over and over again, that’s what lasts online. Folks thought it was about technology and it’s not.
7.Monetizing from the first moment.Google without Adwords is worthless. So Adwords are built in to the experience. Not, ""hey, we have to do this because otherwise we’ll go out of business"" but ""this actually makes the service better."" Given how cheap most online services are to build and run, you can’t charge money if the only reason you’re charging is to make a profit. Charging adds friction and selectivity. If those two elements are a drag on your service, you will fail. Hotmail’s founders missed this point. Banner ads made hotmail worse, not better, and because they didn’t build useful ads into the service from the start, they never could.
8. Not depending on a big, hairy partner.Sure it would be great if you could be on Yahoo’s home page every day, or built into blogger or featured on Fox every night. But it would be great if you won the lottery, too. That’s a wish, not a plan.
9.Ignoring the pundits.Including me. If I’m so smart, why don’t I go build your business?
10.Keeping promises.Even though the Net is here and it’s real, that doesn’t mean that the laws of business have been suspended forever. And those two words capture the best of what we’ve learned for four hundred years. Do what you say you’re going to do and the rest is a lot easier.",,"success, execution, entrepreneurship"
Why this “Internet thing” is just starting,"Yes, it’s only been ten years.
And despite our memories of the crash of 2000, here are ten reasons why I believe that there’s about to be a significant flourishing of Net companies and business successes, not to mention extremely cool things for the rest of us:*
1.Penetration.There are 50 times as many people using the Net as there were then. 50x is a multiple you don’t see every day.
2.Bandwidth.It’s easy to forget how horrible modem surfing was. The prevalence of high bandwidth connectivity means that surfing is far more natural, more frequent and that the experience is better as well.
3.Tools.You can launch most any online service with almost no custom programming. Changethis.com demonstrated to me how straightforward this has become. It also means that finding the world’s greatest programmer is no longer a critical component formostservices.
4.Servers.When google can offer a gig of storage for free, it’s proof that server space is essentially free. You may recall that justthreeten years ago, aonethree gig hard drive cost $3000.
5.Wifi.The next generation of wifi will be faster, but more important, have a vastly improved range. Which means, for example, that all of downtown Philadelphia will offer free wifi. With ubiquity will come cheap machines that dramatically increase the number of surfers, and put those surfers most everywhere.
6.Multimedia.The web is still stuck in ASCII world, but not for long. Add a few million video cameras, fifty million cell phone cameras, every song ever recorded, every TV show and movie ever made and the contents of most any scholarly book and it gets interesting fast. Sure, the lunkheads at the RIAA and MPAA will make up lies to try to stop it, but the cosmic jukebox meets the realtime surveillance camera is going to happen.
7.Grandmothers.It is no longer necessary to explain to the average American (of any generation) what this ""Internet thing"" is. Google has made the world safe for entrepreneurs. Don’t underestimate how important this is.
8.Teenagers.The Yahoo generation is now getting driver’s licenses!! These are kids who have grown up without encyclopedias or videocassettes or lps. These are kids who have completely and permanently integrated the Net into their lives and are about to go to work and to college.
9.VC.Fred Wilson (Link:A VC.) has more than a hundred million dollars to invest in great Net companies. So do a dozen or more other (less talented) venture capitalists. Given that it takes far less money today (see #10 and #3) than ever, this means the search for money is not the challenge.
10.The death of TV.(It wouldn’t be a Seth Godin post if I didn’t mention the death of TV, would it?) You know what killed the first crop of stupid $100 million Internet consumer service startups? Advertising. They all believed that they need to spend millions to build a brand.  Today, we’ve got proof–every single (no exceptions!) Internet success is a success because ofUnleashing the ideavirus. It’s not TV ads. It’s word of mouse.

Amazon and Coffee,"Amazon just announced that you can pay $79 and get a year’s worth of superfast shipping in exchange. For anyone buying more than a few items a month, it’s a no brainer.
But this has nothing to do with saving money on shipping and everything to do with Amazon’s innate understanding of human nature. Once you buy in, every single time you buy something from any other store (online or off) you’ll say to yourself, ""ouch, I can’t buy this here. I’ll be wasting the money I spent at Amazon.""
I love the idea that you can pay a lump sum and get a discount going forward.
The Soy Luck Club, my favorite place in New York, just announced the breakfast club. Pay $40 or so and you get breakfast every day for a month. ""Grab and go"" it’s called.

Best of all, she starts finding products for her customers instead of finding customers for her products.
Imagine a new chain of cafes that offers a coffee club. For a flat fee, you get all the wifi and lattes you can handle. With the markup on both, the owner does great, and people would feel terrible every time they strayed.

"Great job (last part, for now)","A friend of mine is a world-class lawyer, with a great background in copyright, deal-making and intellectual property issues. She has a stellar resume and could get a cog-job in about two seconds. Except that she doesn’t want to do that. She wants to work for a fast-growing neat organization with flexible hours. And she’s willing to take a 60% pay cut to do so.
In the current system, there’s no place for her (or for you, for that matter) to let the right person know that they ought to rethink the way they’re allocating their payroll and their services budget and take advantage of this opportunity.This is ridiculous.There’s no other similar expense in a corporation that is totally demand based. Companies don’t say, ""We’re thinking of replacing our phone system, please let us know if there’s some new technology that we don’t know about"" or ""Our charity currently uses a traditional system to do fundraising but we’re auditioning automated online systems, please send a properly formatted brochure…""
Well, if the single-most-important thing a business can do is hire amazing people, why shouldn’t thatprocess be more flexible and be built around the people, not the slots?
At this point, I’m supposed to point you to some amazing web site that is people-centric, not job-centric, and talk about how smart bosses from around the globe are using it to scout for great people. How an eBay-like revolution is changing this huge marketplace. I can’t, so I won’t.
Sure, there are resume-driven sites. Wouldn’t matter. The bosses aren’t there. The culture hasn’t shifted yet.
But it will.
Why not print this blog out, attach it to a letter (not a resume not a resume not a resume!!!) and send it off to the place that needs you? If two or three or ten people did it, it might not matter, but if thousands of people started auctioning off their skills in the way it ought to be done (recognizing that you, not the factory, is where the value is) it could become a movement.","February 2, 2005","Job market, talent allocation, people-centric hiring"
Great job (part 2),"Well, if it’s the jobs at little companies that we want, what’s wrong with the current system?
In my experience, little companies are rarely so organized that they know just what slot to fill, what to call that slot and who to hire for that slot. In all the fast-growing companies I’ve encountered, a new job is just that… new. More often than not, companies bump into someone cool and find a job for them. Or, even more likely, they see someone really cool at ANOTHER company, wish they had that person and invent a job that they hope someone like that will fill.
Implicit in this reasoning is this: it’s thePurple Cowthat will fill this job beautifully. Not some automaton who will follow orders, but someone remarkable who will ask great questions and make magical things happen.
So, if you were going to invent a system where remarkable, hard-to-classify people got hooked up with fast-growing organizations that could put those skills to work, would it look anything like the classified section of the New York Times?
I don’t think so.",,"job creation, fast-growing companies, remarkable talent"
Are you looking for a great job? (part 1),"I’ve been thinking about the job-finding/person-finding paradox a lot lately, and it seems completely broken to me.
Consider a few facts:1. The traditional way to get a job is to send a boring resume in response to as many posted jobs as you can afford. Your resume will be scanned, culled and if it doesn’t stand out too much, a person might look at it.
Then you go for a job interview and try to be coglike in your malleability and desire to fit in. If random acts are working in your favor, you get the job.
2. Then, the big Fortune 1000 company that hired you complains that all their people act like cogs, don’t care enough, aren’t creative in solving problems and don’t push the status quo.
3. Then, the big Fortune 1000 company realizes that as long as they’ve got interchangeable cogs, they ought to just move jobs offshore, cause that’s cheaper
or
3.a. The company doesn’t do that, succumbs to Wall Street pressure and either cheats (and gets caught and tanks) or doesn’t cheat (and gets bought or folded and tanks).
Something’s wrong here.
Let’s start with one assumption that has changed in just a generation:
It turns out that 100% of all job growth is now coming from small (under 500 person) companies. In fact, the big companies are shedding jobs, not adding them.
That wasn’t true for our parents. It’s true for us.
Also true: more likely than not, the best jobs, the most interesting jobs and the most secure jobs happen in small organizations.
SO: first conclusion: fitting in to get a job for the big guy is a bad strategy for everyone.

The post had to do with a dongle (see picture down below) that all bloggers would have to attach to their machines in order to post.
It involved a blog tax, the proceeds of which would be used to fund Orrin Hatch’s attempts to ban P2P and all sorts of useful progress in online technology. It involved registering all bloggers and creating a division of the Department of Homeland Security that would monitor all blog posts to see if they threatened our moral security.

Certainly a lot of bloggers are very much out front. Do we givebloggers the press exemption? If we don’t give bloggers the pressexemption, we have the question of, do we extend this to online-onlyjournals like CNET?""
My whole shtick was that I was going tosupportthe blog tax and talk about what a good idea it was… thus leading other bloggers to be outraged and rip me to pieces for supporting something so entirely stupid.
But I’m not going to post it. In fact, this is my last post until Saturday. Why? Because everything is being taken so seriously, especially when individuals feel deceived, mistreated or foolish.
I got a note earlier today from someone excoriating Best Buy because the price they offered for a CD in the store was <gasp> a few dollars different from what they were offering the same thing online. They were outraged.

Noses cut to spite faces department,"Petra Rankin shares this story:
I went for a drive to pick up some business cards from my local printer. When I got there, I was handed four boxes of very shiny business cards, even though I had specifically ordered matte. I had specified matte a number of times because it was very important to me, and he was also charging me a premium price for the matte laminate.
So I told the person who was serving me that they were not matte, and I was told in response “yes they are.” (!)
Given that these cards were so shiny I could almost see my reflection in them, I asked to speak to the manager. He come out and agreed that they were not matte, and also agreed that I had asked him a number of times to print matte cards, but he would not lower the price of the cards. I offered him what I thought the cards were worth given they were a misprint, but he was too proud and said I couldn’t take them!
So he is throwing away 1000 perfectly good (albeit shiny) cards, because he didn’t want to accept a discounted price for a mistake!
I wonder how many other small business people operate their business like this? They would rather have a big loss than accept a small one?
(PS She just wrote me and said the printer called her at home, told her had changed her mind and even offered to drive the cards over if she’d just pay the discounted fee.)

People or systems?,"Chris Garrettsays I’m wrong about the Westin. That they should fix their systems, not their people.
I can’t think of one world class service organization (whether it’s someone selling million dollar computers to corporations or Starbucks) that has figured out how to replace great people with great systems.
The best organizations have principles and guidelines and even, yes, scripts. But time and again, they fall back to, ""Use your best judgment"" or ""Do what’s right for the customer"" or ""Make something magical happen"" or ""Ladies and gentlemen serving ladies and gentlemen.""
When a hotel chain empowers a maid to spend up to $500 to make it right (using her own discretion), that’s not a system, that’s trusting great people to do the right thing.
The problems with systems?1. if you rely on them too much, your people stop trying, and your hiring people realize they don’t have to get such great people.2. sooner or later, it’s going to get copied by the competition. It’s a lot easier to copy a system than it is to get great people.
JetBlue is first and foremost about the people Amy Curtis hired and trained. The systems allow the great people to do great work.
Yes, if you can automate it in a way that increases satisfaction, do it right away. Use an ATM system instead of the front desk at the hotel. Use an automated wake up call system. But then put the money you save into wonderful people at the concierge desk.",,"People, Systems, Customer Service"
Adventures in travel,"Staying atThe Westin Hotelin Florida to give a speech today. The staff here is very scripted, doing things because they were told to, not because it comes naturally. My favorite example: When you ask for a wake up call in the morning, they automatically respond, ""Would you like a follow up call fifteen minutes later?"" I said no. They asked me the same question when I called an hour later to change the time. Same no answer from me.
So this morning, as is usual when I travel, I woke up an hour earlier than I wanted to. Before going to work out, I called to cancel my wake up so the ringing phone wouldn’t bother the neighbors. The receptionist then asked, ""Would you like me to cancel the follow up call as well?""
Obviously, there’s no reason on earth that someone who is already awake and is cancelling their wakeup call would still want to be reminded of the call fifteen minutes later. Especially if they didn’t ask for the reminder call in the first place. But there it is in the script, so it’s an error that’s repeated over and over.
I know it’s more difficult, but hiring people who can think for themselves is usually a better long run strategy than scripting every conversation. If that’s the plan, it’s probably better to get an automated system. And not just at a hotel in Florida…",,"Customer service, scripted responses, hotel experience"

You can always be mean later (respect works),"Here’s a fascinating case study in the power of being nice.
Lawyers have customers too, and not just the people who pay the bills. If a lawyer can successfully market her ideas to an adversary, she’s far more likely to get a case settled quickly and to her client’s advantage.
Consider the case of Julie Greenberg and Hank Mishkoff. You can see the entire thing in detail here:Taubman Sucks!.
Ms. Greenberg represented (or I should say, mis-represented) a giant chain of shopping malls. A few years ago, she and Taubman went after Hank Mishkoff, who controlled a domain Taubman wanted for one of its malls. Her opening salvo was a classic lawyer’s demand letter, very formal and threatening.
Of course, most people respond to a note like that with fear and trepidation and then anger. And it spirals from there. I wonder if any law firm has ever done testing as to whether letters like that are actually effective. What if she had called first, or sent a friendly, clearly written letter that outlined mutually beneficial options for both sides?
Instead, Greenberg started mean and escalated from there. Classic litigator tactics, reflecting a ""my typewriter is sterner than yours"" age-old tactic. Sometimes people fold in the face of this approach (but even when they do, it’s expensive for both sides).
Hank responded by defending himself and taking it to court.
In the end, he won. It cost Taubman tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. Yet, it’s clear to me by watching the correspondence, if the very first interaction had been civil or even pleasant, Jill Greenberg could have ended with a win for 1% of what the loss cost her (actually, it didn’t costheranything. She made a profit on it! It cost her client a boatload of money, though).
Even if you’re not a lawyer (orespeciallyif you’re not a lawyer) the lesson here is pretty clear: it doesn’t matter who’s ""right"". What matters is that giving people the benefit of the doubt and treating them with respect is not only more fun, it works better too.

Shortcuts,"I did an interview yesterday with a magazine that specializes in marketing. They’ve got hundreds of thousands of readers, most in the direct mail business.
The reporter didn’t like the answer I gave her about how to build a email marketing list. I told her that the first step was to offer something in your email newsletter that people would actuallywantto read. That the second step was to promise people exactly what you intended to give them. And the third step was to create content that was so remarkable that people wanted to share it. I explained that if you take your time and keep your promises, it’ll build if it deserves to build.
She wanted to know about shortcuts.
At least three times she asked me what the shortcuts were. How to do it if you were in a hurry. Most important, how to do it if your message wasn’t that interesting.
Sigh.

Godin’s Leveraged Effort Curve,"Among highly-compensated workers, the amount of work you get paid for actually goes down as you get paid more.
A talented doctor spends no more than ten or fifteen minutes a day actually doing the thing that she’s actually gifted at
An insightful web designer spends just a few minutes a day actually doing insightful web design.
A great lawyer might be pushed to the edge of his talents once or twice a week.
The same goes for salespeople, farmers, novelists and hockey players. The baseline level of talent in most professions is pretty high, and the really exceptional people shine only rarely.
There’s too much overhead. A doctor needs to fill out forms, meet salespeople, answer phone calls, travel from hospital to hospital, manager her staff and every once in a while, see a patient. And most of those patients are run of the mill cases that a medical student could handle.
I’m talking about knowledge workers, obviously. Knowledge workers get paid extra when they show insight or daring or do what others can’t. But packaging the knowledge is expensive, time consuming and not parituclarly enjoyable for most people. As you get better at what you do, it seems as though you spend more and more time on the packaging and less on the doing.
(and yes, I know the chart above is about infected acorns, but it had the right slope)
The exception?
The intense conversations you can have with your customers and prospects, especially via a blog. Once you get the system and the structure set up, five minutes of effort can give you four minutes of high leverage idea time in front of the people you’re trying to influence.
When the net is broken (spam, popups, cc lists, most instant messaging) it just adds more ""time overhead"" to what you do. But when it’s working, it allows ideas to be stripped down to their essence and allows you to really push.
The temptation, when living without the time overhead, is to invent new overhead so you can stall. All these features available on blogs allow bloggers to spend time doing diligent housekeeping, with the excuse that it’s necessary. In fact, by stripping away the time overhead, what it means to be a knowledge worker might just change.",,"Leverage, Knowledge Workers, Overhead"

Five apples
This is what my life is like. I have four apples. At least I’m pretty sure there are only four, I only bought four, I can only see four and there is no reason to suppose I have any more. There could be five I suppose, but I see no reason to think so. The trouble is, everyone else thinks there are five. I ask people for evidence that there are five apples. I ask them what reason they have to suppose there are five, or to show me how they counted five, and these are the replies I get:

1. What do you mean, “count the apples”?
2. Have you studied agriculture? If not, how do you know there aren’t five apples?
3. The majority of people in the world know there are five apples.  Are you saying they are all wrong?
4. It’s closed-minded to think there aren’t five apples.
5. There is plenty of evidence to prove that there are five apples, go and look for it, I’m not counting them for you.
6. Apples can’t be “counted” by science, so there are five apples.
7. Can you prove there isn’t a fifth apple somewhere?
8. Scientists counted only three apples in the past and now they admit there are four, so there are five now.
9. The ancient Chinese knew there were five apples; modern science still has not yet caught up.
10. They laughed at Galileo when he said there were five bananas, and he was right, so there are five apples.
11. Science can’t yet see all the apples. You can’t see radio waves, but they existed before we developed ways to measure them, so why can’t there be a fifth invisible apple now that we just haven’t developed the technology to see?
12. Quantum mechanics proves there are five apples.
13. I just know the fifth apple is there.
14. It’s a government conspiracy to cover up the existence of the fifth apple.
15. You’re not keeping up with the latest research. It has now been proven that there are five apples (although I can’t actually remember where this research is written up).

My Wifi Rant,"This one has been a long time gestating, but today’s New York Times completely pushed me over the edge (Link:The New York Times > Technology > Growth of Wireless Internet Opens New Path for Thieves.)
As I make my travels through the Northeast, I’m stunned by how many wifi networks my Mac encounters–and how many of them are password protected. Waiting in the doctor’s office, for example, I find five networks. And every one of them is closed.
Why on earth would someone go to the trouble to do this?
I mean, I’m sitting at an ad agency or a cosmetic firm and their network is closed. I’m standing outside of an office building and there are 18 networks and all of them are closed. All of them!
It’s like having a television on and intentionally putting up blinders so that certain people can’t watch it. Worse, it’s like making an apple pie and putting nose plugs on people who would like to smell it! (I like pie, not crazy about TV).
Having the wifi network in your lobby or your waiting room or in the street under your window open to guests will not compromise the security of your files. You need a different sort of security for that. And it won’t degrade your net performance much either (hey, if it does, you can always turn the password on again, cursing me out as you do). [NB I’m not a computer security expert, and I’m not making a statement about the risk to your data. What I am saying is that if you’re dealing in stuff that’s super confidential–like medical records or which Congressman is breaking which law–then you’ve got no business using a wifi network anyway.]
And yet, here comes the influentialTimeswith an urgent warning that all sorts of pedophiles, car bombers–hey, even people who do graffiti or spit on the street–are using this major hole in our security networks to do bad deeds. Since the article focuses on the dreaded ""data thieves"" it’s easy to assume that they’re stealing data from the networks.They’re not.They’re just hiding from the FBI. But if everyone jumps up and down and starts closing their networks, these data thieves will just take one of their stolen credit cards and go to Starbucks!
There were no razor blades in apples on Halloween when we were growing up. Did you know that? Really. They made it up. Someone should tell theTimesand its readers that if you want to be anonymous on the Net, you can go to Kinko’s or go to Bryant Park or the library.

A Warning About Ostrich Farming,"Have you ever eaten ostrich?
I missed my chance when I gave up poultry as the last land animal on my eating list.
My guess is that you haven’t had a lot either.
It turns out that there was a huge bubble in ostrich farming (yes, they have bubbles off the internet, too). Once a few clever promoters (Ostriches On Line – Chad.) realized that the world would go crazy about ostrich meat (and don’t forget the eggs) there was money to be made selling breeding ostriches.
So, you bought two ostriches and a bunch of land, and soon you have some baby ostriches. You sold those ostriches for $20,000 or more each–to other people who wanted to breed ostriches. Do this for a few generations and pretty soon there would be plenty of ostrich meat available (and the breeders at the top of the pyramid would be rich indeed).
You can guess the punchline. The breeders sold their ostriches to other breeders, and soon there were plenty of ostriches but in the end, restaurants didn’t want to sell the stuff because people didn’t really want to eat it.
The blogads survey (see below) says that more than 20% of blog readers are also blog writers. Imagine a world where 20% of the people whoreadnovels,wrotenovels. Hope we’re not breeding ostriches. We’re so busywritingthat maybe, just maybe, nobody who shows up is going to actually spend the time to read! As a parting shot, here’s a quick blurb from the ostrich site:

When your customers hold you back,"Ten or twelve years ago, I used to buy stuff from Paper Direct. They sell preprinted sheets that you run through your laser printer to make brochures and business cards and such.
In those days, when laser printers were still a little rare (and only printed in black toner) this was a neat way to make a sole proprietorship seem a little more professional.
I got their catalog in the mail today and browsed through it. I was stunned. The stuff they sell is exactly the same. The same pastel colors, boring designs, slightly cheesy look and very cheesy fonts in the examples. The market has changed radically but the products haven’t changed a bit.
Today you can print astonishing color on a $200 printer. You can do professional short run printing on an Indigo machine. But Paper Direct is still selling design from the 1980s. It sort of screams, ""home office!""
My bet? I think that every time they try to introduce something more hip or effective than ""PC1606 Tropical Fish Postcards"", their audience doesn’t buy any. As a result, they slavishly serve their existing audience. Which is no doubt profitable, but how can they grow?

What happens next?,"I think there are two blog/RSS frontiers worth considering… whether you manage a project, a church or a brand.
The first is the idea of the micro-blog. Ed Brenegar got asked to help a small group understand word of mouth and turned it into a blog:University of Word Of Mouth. Now, as he gets new groups to work with, he can repurpose the blog. I did the same thing when I produced a musical for an elementary school last year. I made a blog for the parents to use to keep up with the news about the play, with the schedule, with photos of each rehearsal.
Blogging doesn’t have to mean ""talking to anonymous strangers.""
The second is what BaseCamp is doing (Link:Project management and task management software: Basecamp.) This is project management software that uses RSS to alert the people who need to be alerted whenever something is up… and they can ignore it the rest of the time.
RSS is like email, except there’s no spam, the loop is closed, the media that’s available is far wider and, best of all, the recipient can configure a host of readers to present the info in the way they want. Thinking like this led to podcasting, and it’s going to lead us in a bunch of new directions now.",,"micro-blog, project management, RSS"

"Where is the rainbow? (long tail, part 2)","Some of my friends are bloggers that look like America. Women bloggers, Asian bloggers, bloggers of color.
Lately, there’s been some wailing from this community. How come the democratic, open blogging community appears to be turning into yet another white male bastion?
I’m hesitant to wade in here, because feelings are pretty easily bruised, but I’ve been giving it a lot of thought because it doesn’t make sense.
Obviously, the problem isn’t that traditionally under-promoted communities aren’t talented enough to write a popular blog.
Also, it’s not possible that these communities don’t have access to the marketplace. Most of us have precisely the same access. If you’ve got $20 a month and a public library, you can do this.
I also don’t believe the problem lies with the audience. I don’t think people (orBloglines. for that matter) screen content based on who it was written by. If the headline registers, you click and read. Then, and only then, do you bother to worry about the origins of the person who wrote it.
So what is it?
I think it involves the long tail.
In the old days, it mattered a great deal who you knew. If you knew the head of casting at MGM or someone at CAA or the right A&R person, you got the ""break"" you needed to find an audience. If you knew someone on Sandhill Road, you could get funded. Today, most of the winners work their way up. Boing Boing did, Scoble did and so did Doc Searls.
Working your way up requires a few things:1. Persistence. Success comes slowly, and you have to stick with it.2. Patience. Your peers won’t see success, so the fortitude needs to be internal.3. Low overhead (access to resources). While dealing with #1 and #2, you need a day job, and more important, the confidence to keep going even though it doesn’t seem like it’s going to work.
It seems to me that some communities are better at supporting all three than others. One reason, for example, that Silicon Valley creates start ups is that the entire community, from the supermarket to the school to the church to the bank supports the process.
Many of the underserved communities I’m talking about can’t provide the support and expectations that many white men get. In other words, the blogosphere isn’t stacked against women and others, the real world is.
The real world doesn’t even know what you’re doing. All they know is that you’renotdoing what they expect. And the curse is that once this new thing turns real, once the community expects you to go off and do it, it’ll be much much harder to succeed.
So, what I would say to the struggling entrepreneur or pundit or expert or consultant or musician or person spreading that important idea is this:1. it’s okay if it doesn’t happen fast2. don’t worry so much about getting the approval of those who came before and are farther along the curve3. keep costs as low as possible so you can do this without panicking when it doesn’t work so fast4. surround yourself with friends and colleagues who ""get it"" and root for you, even when it’s not going so fast(variant: fire the friends and mothers-in-law who aren’t supporting you so much!)5. realize that it’s not about you or the way you look or what you wear. It’s about the tail.
I started with plenty of advantages, but it took me a decade to make it as an entrepeneur. That’s a lot of macaroni and cheese. I was lucky–my network didn’t lose faith.
Obviously, this applies to a lot more than blogging. There are so many tiny businesses (like eBay selling) or bigger businesses (like designing stuff) where these same rules apply. I hope this new medium finally gets us where we need to be.",,"blogging, diversity, entrepreneurship"
Scorecards,"For a long time, Metro North  lied about their ontime record. According to their policies, a train was “on time” if it got in less than six minutes late. For a harried New Yorker, six minutes is a lot, especially on a 25 minute ride.So Metro North bragged about their ontime record and it didn’t jibe with user expectations. So consumer happiness was quite low.What did Metro North do? Did they work hard to train engineers and upgrade machinery to make the trains run on time? Nope. They chose an effective marketing tactic instead: they changed the schedule.By adding a few minutes to every ride (on the schedule) they are telling a very different story, setting different expectations. People aren’t going to avoid the train because now the schedule says it’s going to get in three minutes later, but they are going to smile more when the train gets there when they expected it was going to get there.",,"Metro North, on-time record, consumer expectations"
Thinking about the Long Tail (part 1),"Chris Anderson wrote a brilliant article, and was clever enough to post it as a ChangeThis manifesto:ChangeThis :: The Long Tail.
I can’t stop thinking about it, but in ways that are different than his original riff.
His point (for which he has data!) is that once we eliminate artificial bottlenecks like shelf space and the spectrum restrictions, the mass market effect drops off very quickly.
Give people 1,000 channels to watch, and they won’t all watch the same thing.Give people 1,000,000 books to read, and they won’t all want to read a bestseller.
Yes, people read the DaVinci Code because everyone else is. Yes, people watch The Apprentice for the very same reason. But no, this effect isn’t as pervasive as most of us would believe.
Joe Krause (co-founder of Excite) jumped on the bandwagon with this insightful post about what he saw there: Link:Bnoopy: The long tail of software. Millions of Markets of Dozens.His data shows that 3% of the searches were about the same handful of things… and that the other 97% were all spread out.
Apple’s iTunes store has the same effect at work. They’ve sold more than a milliondifferentsongs.
So, we see that:1. hits aren’t what they used to be. Hit TV shows, hit music, hit books–it’s impossible to get the volume you could get 20 years ago in almost any field (even business to business stuff like consulting).
2. the choices are wider than ever before and the pickins for each producer are slimmer than ever.
Great. So what to do about this?
Well, unmentioned in these posts as far as I can tell is this:
It’s cheaper than ever (by an order of magnitude) to make a product and bring it to market.
Which means your hits can be smaller.Which means you can make more variety.
So, when Coke launches Water Salad beverage in Japan, it doesn’t have to be a New Coke sized hit (or miss) in order to succeed. You can have a blog with 1,000 loyal readers and do just fine, thanks very much, on an ROI basis.
Our instinct is to push, to pull strings, to advertise, to hustle, to do whatever it takes to get to that top 3%. Hey, if you can write the Da Vinci Code, more power to you.
The better path, though, is to figure out how to be:patientpersistentand low cost
enough to be quite happy with a whole bunch of long tail scraps. A dollar here and a dollar there and soon, it all adds up.
This is my best advice if you have a radio station, a supermarket, an insurance agency or run Apple computer.

I will happily stand corrected if Jupiter is that sure of the data. What’s fascinating though is that among all the mail I got from my sophisticated reader base, not one person wrote in to tell me she deletes her cookies daily.

FOAF,"means friend of a friend.
Link:Social networks: All around the Net, but underused by news sites.
This is such a loaded expression. It starts with ""friend"". Not a formal relationship, but a tenuous one. And a relationship that doesn’t belong to you! The friendship is between your friend and her friend.
The very idea of utilizing a FOAF network for your own gain is scary. Scarier still is allowing your FOAF network to be used by someone else to make a profit.
There are firms sprouting up every day promising big companies that they will do just that. That they’ll organize and exploit FOAF networks to product big profits for corporations. It might work for a little while, but not for long.
The reason is the tenuous nature of the friendships. The fourth person in the chain (marketer, you, your friend, your friend’s friend) is awfully low on the totem pole.
So what works? Two things:
1. Smooth, simplify and formalize the process of spreading the idea so if an idea is worth spreading, it’ll run into less friction. The white headphones on the iPod, for example, amplify the message of the player even when someone can’t see it.
2.  Make stuff that people want to spread even if they don’t care about you. The Republicans definitely got this right during the last election cycle.",,"FOAF, social networks, profit exploitation"

Good news and bad news,"So, for 119 Harvard MBA students, the phone rings. ""Buddy, you’re not going to be admitted to the MBA program because you decoded a poorly written website and found out your admissions status too soon."" [This means, of course, that for the next two years, you don’t have to pay Harvard more than $150,000 in room and board and lost wages, and  you can build your own business or join a non-profit or run for the Senate].
So what’s the bad news?
Plenty of handwringing about the ethics or lack thereof in this case (the media loves the turmoil) but I think a more interesting discussion is what a gift these 119 people got. An MBA has become a two-part time machine. First, the students are taught everything they need to know to manage a company from 1990, and second, they are taken out of the real world for two years while the rest of us race as fast as we possibly can.
I get away with this heresy since I, in fact, have my own fancy MBA from Stanford. The fact is, though, that unless you want to be a consultant or an i-banker (where a top MBA is nothing but a screen for admission) it’s hard for me to understand why this is a better use of time and money than actual experience combined with a dedicated reading of 30 or 40 books.

Here comes Blog Spam,"IFa computer can do itANDsomeone can make money from itANDthey can do it anonymouslyTHENit’s pretty clear it’s going to happen, even if it ruins a good thing for the rest of us.
Blog growth is accelerating. It’s now doubling every five months or so, with 30,000 new blogs coming every single day.
Except that’s not really good news, because a whole bunch of those blogs are being created with computers automated to spew out countless brainless blogs.
Here’s how it works: you create a program that develops hundreds or even thousands of blogs, all of which are busy referring to each other and to your products. Soon, you start showing up on automated services like google or technorati. You get more than your fair share of traffic.
Hey, it’s not against the law.
But yeah, it’s selfish and it denigrates a valuable resource that the rest of us depend on.
One more time, I’ll say it clearly: anonymity is bad for the net. Wouldn’t you like a switch that would prevent all anonymous email from showing up in your inbox? Or a similar switch in google, which would filter out anonymous trash sites? The Wikipedia would work even better if all its contributors were maskless.

File under: stats that cannot be true,"Jupiter just published a report that says that 10% of US Net users delete the cookies on their web browser every day and 40% do it (in aggregate) every month.

Forgive my skepticism, but it’s inconceivable to me that 40% of the audience knows how to use their browser to erase their cookies.
The echo chamber effect on the Net is stronger than it is anywhere in the world.

Coffee Lies,"It’s hard to remember back when a cup of coffee for a dollar was considered extravagant. When I was in college, my partner and I ran a coffee shop in the student center. We sold coffee for 50 cents and cleared thirty cents a cup. And sold thousands of cups a day, all outsourced.Of course, no one buys coffee today. We buy an experience. We buy a story and the way that this story makes us feel. It’s a complex story, involving smells and tastes and the sound of the shop and words and more.I’ve started a collection of bad photographs of coffee store menus. Here’s my first one.The lesson?

After everyone is safely in the ambulance, the accident scene people (and the lawyers) show up. They bring cameras and tape measures and little devices that measure tread wear and stuff. All so they canprovewhat happened.
Of course, if three people see an accident, there are at least three descriptions of what really happened. It doesn’t really matter what you can prove. What matters is the story I tell myself.
Smart lawyers win cases where the facts don’t back them up. That’s because smart lawyers know how to tell a story that people willwantto believe. It’s a story that makes a juror feel competent and ethical and satisfied. It’s a story that has very little to do with the facts and a lot to do with the lies we insist on.

Chocolate Bunnies,"It wasn’t until 1,600 years after Jesus that the Bunny became associated with Easter. If you think about it, it’s pretty weird (bunnies don’t lay eggs), but it’s part of a long standing pattern of new religions stealing symbols and stories from older religions.Bunnies are pretty prolific creatures, and thousands of years ago pagans picked them as a symbol of new life. Spring being the season of new life, bunnies were a sign of celebration and good luck. The story is a good one, and it spread.Just like Christmas trees and lights in the window for the winter holidays, the marketers responsible for spreading the word about Christianity appropriated the symbol to help them market the new holiday.Have I mentioned that Godiva is owned by Campbell’s Soup?Godiva","March 8, 2005","Easter, bunnies, symbolism"

Milton Glaser threw me out,"Ten or fifteen years ago, I took Milton Glaser’s class at the School for Visual Arts in New York. It was a portfolio class, which means you had to have talent to get in.
I didn’t. (have talent). I persisted, and we agreed that I could take the class with all these fancypants designers on probation. My point to him was that I was going to commission and use a lot of design in my career, and I’d be a good part of the mix. The deal was that I’d sit in for three classes and then he could decide if I added value or not.
The first class I was too scared to participate, but I learned a lot.
The second class, I participated and added some good thoughts.
The third class, I disagreed twice with points he made. It may be that I was the first person in a while who had disagreed with himtwice.
He threw me out.
It turns out that:a. I was right about what I disagreed with him on.b. I should have figured out how to stay in the class.c. I ended up buying and doing a lot of design. Go figure.

Putting the card in upside down,"I bought gas for my car today and put the credit card in upside down. Took a few minutes in the snow to figure out what was going on.
But wait. Computers are close to free. Why should it be my job to put the card in right side up? Why can’t the machine read the card in every direction?
Think of how often computers, the web, machines, voice mail systems and other devices require us to change our behavior to make it more convenient for the chip or the chip designer.

The six percent solution,"Over the last decade or two, many neighborhoods have seen the price of homes increase by 100 to 1000%. Because real estate agents charge a commission based on selling price, this means that many agents make ten times as much as they used to for selling a house.
Obviously, they’re not doing ten times as much work.
Sooner or later, in any business that works on percentages, things change and the commissions come under pressure. You can be defensive about this or you can see it as an opportunity.
One broker in Massachusetts now works by the hour (Beating the Realtor commission system). If I were a broker, I’d take the increased cash flow and spend it as fast as I could. I’d fundamentally change what I offer and include a wide range of free services–from a free paint job to help sell the house to a new big screen TV for the buyer or the seller. I’d hire assistants and build a permission-based computer system. I’d realize that no industry is static, especially one where the rates go up by a factor of ten in just a short time.
Obviously, this is about more than just real estate. If you work by the hour, what would happened if you charged a commission instead? (PR folks? Lawyers?)

28 or more cameras,"On the Henry Hudson Bridge to New York are very stern signs warning, “No Photography”. This is undoubtedly for our own security, as bad guys might take photos to case the bridge. Unfortunately for the security folks, the bridge is surrounded by literally hundreds of apartments, each one of which has a window from which highly detailed telephoto pictures could easily be taken.The sign to the left is almost 5 feet tall and greets visitors in the lobby of a very expensive office building on the East Side of Manhattan. Not sure where they got the number 28, or why they need to be precise, except that they are clearly trying to tell me a story. The cheesy ALL CAPS lettering ads to the urgency. This is the same story that buildings in New York use when the guy at the front desk asks to see your driver’s license before allowing you to be admitted. How does having a driver’s license change anything? It doesn’t, of course. The act of stopping to show it does.The implications of lying about security and telling stories to make us feel better is expensive indeed. We’re spending billions in cash (and untold billions in lost time and productivity)pretendingto do something, when all we’re really doing is changing the way people feel. At the same time, we ignore the low-profile but high-value acts of, say, inspecting air cargo.Obviously, we’re not going to eliminate the need to tell stories. What we ought to do, though, is figure out more effective (low-cost and high-impact) ways to tellbetterstories.

Expectations Matter (Part 1 of my visit to Apple),"My Mac is fried (long story).
[if you sent me email in the last two weeks, it’s gone. I hope to have it back soon, but it couldn’t hurt to write again if you’re waiting to hear from me!]
anyway, at noon I headed over to the Mac store in the Palisades Mall north of NYC. My expectations were very low. I had no appointment, figured there’d be a huge line and a not very well trained person.
It turns out I waited one minute. One. The person who helped me, Daniel Cilmi, was terrific. He removed my drive, enabling me to send it out for data recovery. He charged me nothing and promised to have a new drive installed by Wednesday.
I’ll tell this story to 20 people in person and to all of you right now. This is worth WAY more than a superbowl ad, that’s for sure.
Then, pushing my luck, Saturday night I headed out to get the missing ""h"" key fixed on my other laptop. This time, I even had a reservation. Headed to a different Mac store in a different mall.
Yikes
The place is swarming with iPodders. There is only one genius there (one other guy flits in and out) and he’s surly. The other staff in the store are no help. The atmosphere in the room is tense and close and the staff is clearly projecting a ""two more hours on the shift"" vibe.
I didn’t get any help Saturday night… we left an hour after the appointment with no help.
Suddenly, what seemed like a spectacular bonus, an expectation-busting new way of delighting customers has turned into an annoying tax, a fake, a wished-for mirage that didn’t materialize.
All Apple had to do was change my expectations before the second visit. They could underschedule the genius bar, putting fewer people through per hour, but delighting those they helped. They could follow some of the steps in the next posting. They could staff it with happy people instead of surly ones.
Most of all, they could realize this, ""Don’t bother engaging with customers unless you are prepared to invest enough to exceed expectations and delight them. It’s better to do nothing at all.""",,"Apple, customer experience, expectations"
Treat different customers differently (part 2 of my visit to Apple),"My friends Jackie and Ben(church of the customer)will probably agree with me– here goes:
Apple forgets that all customers are not the same. They make the common mistake of believing that every pair of feet that walks in the door is worth just the same as the feet before and the feet after.
My negative Apple store experience last night was the sort of thing that any of my esteemed readers could troubleshoot in less than six minutes.
Problem 1:The geniuses at the Apple bar treat ipod owners like g5 owners. The guy in front of me in line had not one, not two, but three machines with him. He was shlepping $10,000 worth of hardware. That doesn’t include the fact that a heavy Mac user buys a new machine every year or two, and if she runs a company, buys 20 or 200 at a time. An iPod owner, on the other hand, has an expensive toy that he can certainly live without for a day or two.
Why is a genius spending his time wisely when he futzes with an ipod for fifteen minutes while the guy with three Macs just sits there?
The trivial solution:Envelopes! Give anyone with a broken iPod a postage-paid padded envelope. Have them fill out a form online (see my idea below) and drop it in a mailbox. The mail takes the broken ipods to cheap locations where they are quickly triaged and replaced.
Problem 2:For a computer company, Apple is doing a lousy job of using a database to track their very best customers. In order to get on line to meet a genius, you need to type in your first name into a queuing system running on all the machines in the store. Shouldn’t the system where you reserve your slot with the genius be able to figure out who you are and treat you accordingly?
Aside:As long as we’re talking about consumers and treating people with respect, it’s essential to remember this: people don’t remember how long it took them to get service. They remember what the wait was like.
If i were running the genius bar, I’d keep the people waiting superbusy. First, I’d use one (or more) of the many Macs in the store to have people type in their serial number, name, problem, etc. This is all currently done by the genius, which wastes everyone’s time. More important, it would make the customer an active part of the repair process, which would make everyone more engaged and happier.
For iPods, I’d go a lot further. It turns out that there are only three or four things that are wrong with 99% of all the iPods. So why not have a computer-assisted diagnostic station that people could use to reboot or diagnose their iPods with no help at all? Sort of like self serve gas. If, at the end of the process, the machine agrees that the thing is dead, it would print out a receipt and boom, you get a new one.
Apple’s going 90% of the way but more often than not, alienating the very people they were hoping would become engines of postive word of mouth. Matt, the aggressive guy with the iPod, said this when he found out his player was dead, ""What! I have to wait a week? Can’t i just pay the difference in the price and upgrade right here to a new model?"" The answer, ""We’re not affiliated with the retail people. You have to wait until we mail you one.""
Huh?
Not affiliated?
Have to wait?
Won’t take more money?
The Genius Bar is genius. But it needs a whole bunch of tweaking. Sort of like the way you treat your customers?
Moral: Every customer touchpoint needs to be actively reavaluated.
""Could we treat our best customers better?""
""Can we change the story people tell themselves in between the time trouble starts and the time it’s gone?""
""What are we doing that we’ve always done, instead of what we should do?""",,"Customer experience, Apple, Genius Bar"
Don’t Shave That Yak!,"The single best term I’ve learned this year.
I want to give you the non-technical definition, and as is my wont, broaden it a bit.
Yak Shaving is the last step of a series of steps that occurs when you find something you need to do. “I want to wax the car today.”
“Oops, the hose is still broken from the winter. I’ll need to buy a new one at Home Depot.”
“But Home Depot is on the other side of the Tappan Zee bridge and getting there without my EZPass is miserable because of the tolls.”
“But, wait! I could borrow my neighbor’s EZPass…”
“Bob won’t lend me his EZPass until I return the mooshi pillow my son borrowed, though.”
“And we haven’t returned it because some of the stuffing fell out and we need to get some yak hair to restuff it.”
And the next thing you know, you’re at the zoo, shaving a yak, all so you can wax your car.
This yak shaving phenomenon tends to hit some people more than others, but what makes it particularly perverse is when groups of people get involved. It’s bad enough when one person gets all up in arms yak shaving, but when you try to get a group of people together, you’re just as likely to end up giving the yak a manicure.
Which is why solo entrepreneurs and small organizations are so much more likely to get stuff done. They have fewer yaks to shave.
So, what to do?
Don’t go to Home Depot for the hose.
The minute you start walking down a path toward a yak shaving party, it’s worth making a compromise. Doing it well now is much better than doing it perfectly later.

The ever-worsening curse of the cog,"Our story so far:
Since you were five, schools and society have been teaching you to be a cog in the machine of our economy. To do what you’re told, to sit in straight lines and to get the work done.
In the early factory era, there was great demand for trained cogs, the cogs even had unions, and cog work was steady, consistent and respected. There were way worse things than coghood.
Over the last decade or two, that’s all gone away. I found this via Gizmodo:dottocomu: Clocking on with King Jim’s QR code clockand it’s a perfect symptom of what I’m talking about. It’s a clock that puts up the time in a camera-readable format, making it easy for the factory supervisor to automate time in and time out via cell phones.
More important than the device itself is the thought pattern it represents:1. cog labor is a lowest-common denominator activity2. if cog labor gets expensive, automate it3. if you can’t afford to do that, move it somewhere where it’s cheaper4. if your competition does that, figure out how to measure and semi-automate your cog labor to make it cheaper still
The end result is that it’s essentially impossible to become successful or well off doing a job that is described and measured by someone else.

Then I’ll be in Beijing, consulting with the government on how they can more effectively do the messaging for the upcoming Olympics.

Your Coffee Worldview,"At a recent seminar at my office, I had two coffeemakers set up. One had decaffeinated swill in a standard Mr. Coffee carafe type thing, and the other was a fancy Capresso machine.I noticed that people didn’t choose which machined based on caff vs. decaf. Nope, they picked based on a machine.If your worldview says, “I like gadget, premium, hyped, tweaky coffee” you went for the fancy machine. If your worldview was, “I like to settle, take no risks and be safe and predictable with my coffee” you took the other. It didn’t matter which was better. It didn’t matter which cost more. It mattered what you had decided before you even got there.","April 23, 2005","Coffee, Worldview, Choices"
Nouns and verbs,"I had two great seminars in my office this week. Not only do cool people show up, but it pushes me to think hard about new ways to talk about things that work.
Today, we talked about nouns and verbs.
Investments are a noun. Investing is a verb.Paint is a noun. Painting is a verb.A gift is a noun. Shopping for or giving one is a verb.
People care much more about verbs than nouns. They care about things that move, that are happening, that change. They care about experiences and events and the way things make us feel.
Nouns just sit there, inanimate lumps. Verbs are about wants and desires and wishes.
Is your website a noun or a verb?What about your management style or the services you offer?
A few years ago, the rage was to turn products into services. Then it was to turn services into products.
I think the next big thing is to turn nouns into verbs.","April 21, 2005","nouns, verbs, experiences"
Hershey Foods has changed its name,"Now they want to be called just plain Hershey.Why?Well, they’ve spent years selling off their food divisions, leaving them with mostly junk… candy and stuff.It turns out that peopleNEEDfood, and theyWANTcandy. So candy is a lot more profitable. Since Hershey no longer sells food, they want to be sure the stock market knows this. Hershey Junk is probably not a good name for a company, so now it’s just Hershey.Let’s assume that they’re correct, and that the stock market will get the message, giving them a higher PE ratio and stock price because they are in a higher margin business. What this means is that astoryabout what they do will end up being worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Just to tell a story to people who have an incentive to be informed about the truth.

The same thing is true for the billboard on the bank near my house in Buffalo where I grew up. It didn’t matter how many times we looked at it, we looked at it again when we drove by. Why?
Because the time and temperature were always changing! (note that this is not the original Buffalo sign… the palm tree is a giveaway).
In most organizations, the frequency at which consumers are sent messages is far greater than the speed at which the organization actually changes. As a result, most of the messages are boring and repetitive. Which means that you’re training your prospects and consumers to ignore the messages–why bother reading something if you already know what it says?

What kind of vacuum do you want?,"Vacuum cleaners are funny. The act of vacuuming is at least as important as the dust removal itself. A freshly vacuumed rug looks different… but in the short run, there’s really not a lot of visible difference between a rug vacuumed with a really expensive machine and one that was poorly vacuumed.As a result, the worldview of the buyer matters a great deal. If you see yourself manhandling some big loud device, then only a big loud device is going to make you feel as though you did what you were supposed to do.We’ve done the Dyson story to death, so I won’t go into that here. But I got this ad from Francesco Rovati in Italy, and it made me think about the alternatives. Francesco confesses that while this was the most popular vacuum in Italy, it was no better and no cheaper than the alternatives. Clearly, it was the story the ads tell that made the thing sell.The reason that vacuum cleaner makers tell us lies like this is that we demand it. If they just told us the truth (weight and horsepower) they’d be doing nothing at all to make us feel good while we vacuum. And feeling good is why people spend their hard-earned money on things that they don’t actually need.(PS the ad with Tarzan losing his loincloth was too racy for this family-friendly blog).",,"vacuum cleaners, consumer perception, advertising influence"
Do you have a Home Depot problem?,"This is what it looks like as you walk through the parking lot to my Home Depot in Yonkers, New York.No, it’s not a nightclub. It’s a hardware store.
Home Depot has a challenge. They’re not growing the way they want to. Huge discounts were enough to completely disrupt the local market, wiping out many mom and pop competitors. But low prices all by themselves aren’t enough to get a certain part of the population to show up, especially for just one or two (high margin) items like doorknobs, or even worse, stuff like a whole new kitchen.
Walk into the store and you can see which worldview the story is tailored to. It’s not for the homemaker or the occasional do it yourselfer. No, the store is clearly designed by, stocked for and organized around people who buy in volume and, even more than that, hardware geeks.
Take a look at this picture and tell me the truth: is it exciting to you? Does it fill you with anticipation to make your way down this aisle, looking at each item and finding an amazing deal? If so, you’ve got a worldview that matches the story Home Depot tells.
Many people, though, see nothing but dread here. They see a store with no helpful salespeople, a jumble of product, none just quite right, a very very long checkout line and fear. The fear of screwing up. The fear of having to come back and return something. The fear (very real) of something big falling from the top of one of these shelves and squashing them like a bug.
Home Depot is working hard to get new customers. They can’t… not as long as they continue to tell a story that only appeals to just one worldview.
Your organization may be just like the Home Depot. You may be good at one story, you may have grown into that story, but now that story can’t get you to an audience that doesn’t have the same worldview as your existing customers. The common solution is to yell. To yell louder, or more cleverly, or in more targeted media. To insist that you have the solution to this group’s problems, that you haveproofthat you are better, and why oh why won’t they switch.

If you play by those rules, you will almost certainly lose.
After all, that’s why market leaders make rules. They establish a game that they can win, over and over again, against smaller or newer competitors.
The alternative is both obvious and scary: Change the rules.
Newcomers and underdogs can only benefit when the rules change. The safe thing to do feels risky, because it involves playing by a fundamentally different set of assumptions.

Do you believe Paris?,"Celebrity endorsements go back to the days of the early British Monarchy, and they still work. People still pay extra for perfume with Paris Hilton’s name on it (she’s making more than $10 million a year endorsing stuff). Why? Obviously, the perfume isn’t any better. Worse, no one else even knows that you’re wearing this particular scent (it’s not as obvious as, say, Ralph Lauren’s polo pony.)We’d like to believe that we’re not swayed by such obvious nonsense. “No, I buy Polo jeans because they fit me better.” While it’s true that not everyone is easily seduced by Paris, most consumers (including the indigent and extremely poor) can’t help themselves when confronted with just the right endorsement–they pay extra for the story.One of my favorite silly endorsements is Pierce Brosnan endorsing Omega. They’re not paying Pierce because they care about Pierce’s opinion (or that you care about his opinion). They’re paying him because he embodies a fictional character, invented fifty years ago by a now-dead author.So, otherwise rational and intelligent men spend hundreds or thousands of dollars extra to buy a watch endorsed by a fictional character controlled by anonymous film producers and embodied by an actor.

"Race for the top, race to the bottom","I’m in Minnesota today, and I’m so delighted by what I’m experiencing.
In addition to extremely nice people, inspiring architecture, a vibrant arts community and surprisingly good food, there’s a vibe in the air about the work people are doing. This placed is filled with organizations that are working hard to create stuff that’s worth doing.
What a radical difference from so many other places I’ve visited recently. There, you’ll find strip malls and low-grade office parks, with disheartened people following scripts and trying to cut costs. These are consumer and business-focused marketing organizations that have decided that the best way to make a buck is to race to the bottom. To be the cheapest or the fastest to market. No need to worry about a worn carpet or an industrial waste product with side effects. Cutting corners during the day, so they can make enough money to buy what they like at night.
I found the same contrast up in the air. American Airlines is racing to the bottom as fast as they can. The staff has given up. No smiles, no service, no effort. Saving money is the order of the day. Jet Blue, on the other hand, continues to strive to get to the top. From the free wi-fi at JFK to the terminal they want to build there, to the snacks (they even suggest mixes–created by taking say, animal crackers and pretzels and mixing them up–even though it means people are taking twice as much!)
So, I think I understand what happens when you win the race to the top. You end up with a healthy, motivated workforce that’s focused on adding art and joy to your products. You end up with profits and market share and a community that’s glad you’re there.

“We’ve done the right thing all along”,"That’s what Pfizer spokesman Jay Kosminsky had to say about their lobbying efforts on Sudafed and methamphetamines in an article in the Wall Street Journal.
This quote goes a long way to explain the huge gulf between business (and politics) and the people.
When I tell people about the title of my new book(link)All Marketers are Liarsthey usually shake their head and say, ""of course."" This is one more reason why.
Sudafed and other similar cold medicines, it turns out, are a prime raw material for making meth, an insanely dangerous drug that’s ruining the lives of tens of thousands of kids. States have worked hard to require these over the counter drugs to be soldbehindthe counter instead. They’ve often been stymied by lobbyists for the drug industry–led for years by Pfizer, which had a lot to lose if people had to ask for the drug instead of just grabbing it.
Well, Pfizer is launching a new formulation of Sudafed that won’t contain the necessary ingredient for meth, so now it won’t be affected by a new law. In fact, a new law will be a home run for them, since the drug will be all alone on the shelf.
Guess who’s now leading the fight to move the offending drugs to the back of the store?
Good for Pfizer for fixing Sudafed. But shame on them for believing that doing the right thing all along is the same as doing the right short-term thing for the shareholders. It’s not the same. It’s not the same ethically, and it’s not the same in terms of long term profit or branding either.

The problem with blind taste tests,"I was in the supermarket last week, talking to some journalists about lying. We were talking about the fact that bottled water costs more than gasoline, and that some brands cost two or three times as much as others. They suggested doing a blind taste test–pouring one of each into a glass and seeing if people could tell the difference.Big mistake! This is the same mistake that the Pepsi Challenge forced the poor shmoes at Coke into making.The reason it’s a mistake is that in real life, there’s almost never anything that’s really blind. You know what container that beverage came from. You know whether the table has a white linen cloth on it–or whether you’re at a luncheonette. You can see the look in the doctor’s eyes when she talks to you. You can sense the confidence of the sales rep whens he brings the latest advance in ball bearing technology to your office.Blind taste tests take the arrogant position that there is some sort of truth.

"When a word is worth $1,000 (each)","It’s been quite a week for disrespect. And it’s only Thursday.
Half of my incidents have been business-to-business situations. The other half occurred in places where I was just a consumer.
Looking back, I’m really sort of amazed by two things: First, how visceral the feeling is when I feel as though I’ve been disrespected, and second, how easy it would be to avoid.
Let me be clear about a definition here: disrespect is in the eye of the beholder. It occurs when someone feels slighted, or demeaned, or undervalued or lied to. There is no absolute measurement, and, because it’s relative, people will surely disagree about whether or not it has occurred at all.
Doesn’t matter. If you feel disrespected, then you were.
#1. Just spent two hours at the doctor’s office. An entire hour was spent in a little room, waiting. No updates, no apologies, nothing. Even after the doctor finally arrived, for him it was as though the long long wait didn’t even happen. Then, when I nicely asked to talk to the office manager on my way out, she took a phone call instead.
#2. I spent nine months negotiating a deal with a company where I’ve had a long and fruitful relationship. This project was going very, very slowly, and not because I was slowing it down. I’d been patient and flexible and was working it through the system. Two days ago, I got an email. It said, in its entirety, ""Unfortunately, this is getting way too complex and not worth the effort for either of us. I know that we keep trying to make this work (for months now!) but it’s not working for either side.  So, I think we should let this go and part friends.""
There have been four others, just like this. I realized what they all had in common:
All the other person had to do was use a one or two sentences and the whole thing would have been fine.Almost all the instances of disrespect didn’t have to do with the substance of the transaction, it was thestyleof it. If the person had accepted some responsibility and acknowledged how I might feel, the outcome wasn’t really a big deal.
""I’m really sorry you had to wait. Mr. Wilson’s eardrum exploded and we’re doing everything we can to help him.""
""I know you worked long and hard to make this deal work, but we just can’t figure it out. I’m so sorry we wasted your time.""
It’s really simple: most of the time, most of your customers will cut you slack if you just acknowledge that the outcome isn’t the one they (think they) deserve.
People have a hard time with this. If someone feels as though they’re treating you technically correctly, they don’t want to apologize. They don’t want to acknowledge the feelings of the other side. This is awfully short-sighted. These are words that are worth thousands and thousands of dollars in lost sales and word of mouth.

Now, let’s think about this for a minute–what contamination exactly is the doily protecting the food from?

It sounds like Eddie’s in the Holland Tunnel. And it’s not even close to music, but it reminds me of the way I felt when I heard the album.
This is not just happening to music. The cellphone conversation I have with my friend Jonathan has content, but the tone and tenor of his voice merely remind  me of the way I feel when I hear him live.
And the millions of digital photos I see online don’t look anything like the original high resolution versions, which, of course, look nothing like the thing in real life.
My dad used to tell me a joke. This guy is on a tour of the state prison with the warden. They walk into the lunchroom and see the following:
A prisoner stands up. He says, ""142!""
Everyone laughs hysterically.
Another prisoner stands up. He is giggling, but manages to blurt out, ""884.""
The place rocks with laughter.
The tourist can’t figure out what’s going on. He asks the warden.
""Well, you see, these guys are all here for life sentences. They’ve heard every joke a million times. So, instead of retelling the jokes, they just call out the number.""
""Wow,"" the tourist says, ""Can I try that?""
The warden is dubious, but says, ""sure.""
""191,"" cries the tourist. The place is dead quiet. Like a tomb.
Humiliated, the tourist turns to the warden and asks what he did wrong.
""It’s the way you tell it,"" said the warden with a wry smile.
I wonder what happens when our digital culture has nothing to do but spread pale imitations of the original experiences? I wonder what happens when the media companies that depend on our attention start losing it when all we’ve got is a ringtone.
I think my books change a lot more minds than my blog does. But books don’t spread the way digital ideas do.

Quite an LED,"The Brookstone catalog describes the new Panasonic nose cleaner this way:“Panasonic’s trimmer uses bright white LED light to precisely cut unwanted nose and ear hair.”For all the people who have been holding back on hair trimming because they didn’t want to deal with blades, this, apparently, is the nose hair trimmer for you.Of course, LEDs can’t cut hair.

more on Daylight Saving Time (dumb cows!),"Ian Daley chimes in with this:
I really enjoyed reading your post on daylight saving. I live in Queensland Australia, and about 15 years ago, we decided by referendum here not to have Daylight Savings. The big problem is that the other two states of Australia on the east coast, NSW and Victoria, both have daylight savings. [Ed. note: There’s no ""s"" in saving. Really. I’ll leave it in because, hey, it sounds better.]
At the time the arguments against trolled out were amazing. Bear in mind that QLD is a mostly rural state, but 75% of the population live in the Metropolitan areas of Brisbane and Surfers Paradise. Anyway, here are some of the brilliant ideas that were put forward to stop Daylight Saving.
""It would confuse the cows, they wouldn’t know what time to get milked as cows aren’t very smart"" (please don’t laugh at the irony of this.)""It will fade the curtains. The Queensland sun is very harsh, and an extra hour could really do some damage""""It would be uncomfortable having dinner at 8 pm and it still being daylight""
The arguments for were:
""Sydney is the business capital of Australia and it has Daylight Savings""""Co-coordinating differences in flights, phone call rates, meetings and general business between the states will be more difficult without daylight savings than with.""""The Australian population is more transient and having a shifting time difference throughout the year is going to make doing business in Queensland awkward.""
As history recalls, the country folk’s faded curtains won over the city people’s pressing need to do business. 15 years on, whilst we persevere with the time difference, it still causes many problem and I would consider it a major pain in the proverbial. However, since we decided by referendum to not have daylight saving, it would take another very costly referendum to change this.

I’m in the middle ofSeize the Daylight : The Curious and Contentious Story of Daylight Saving Time. An odd topic for a book, something to read after you’ve readSaltandCod,but still fascinating.
Here are some things worth noting about the evolution of DST:
""Invented"" by Ben Franklin
but not really, because in 1444, the walled city of Basel was about to be attacked. There were infidels outside, and some had infiltrated the town. The guards caught some of the bad guys and heard that the attack was to begin precisely at noon. An alert sentry changed the clock in the square an hour. Brilliant! The insiders, unaided by their allies, started their diversion an hour early. They were all arrested.
But i digress. This book makes you do that.
Lobbying for DST started in earnest about 100 years ago. (Only 80 years after time was standardized–before trains, it didn’t really matter that the time was different in different towns.) It if hadn’t been for the need to save energy during WWI, it never would have been instituted–the forces against change refused to accept how much money would be saved (turns out it is millions and millions of dollars a year, probably billions by now) and were against it in general principle.
Sir William Christie, Astronomer Royal, called DST nothing but special legislation for late risers (ah, the moral failing card).
Sir William Napier Shaw, director of the Meteorological office said, ""To alter the prsent mode of measuring time would be to kill a goose that lays a very valuable egg.""
Nature magazine said, ""The advance from local to the standard time of today was a step well thought out, and one that cannot be reversed by the introduction of a new and really nondescript time under the old name.""
The Secretary of the London Stock Exchange, Mr. Satterthwaite said the bill would, ""Create a dislocation of Stock Exchange business in the chief business centre of the world.""
Of course, many reactionaries with nothing concrete to say merely mocked William Willet, the chief proponent of the change.Naturewondered if his next trick was going to be to redefine the thermometer so that in the winter it would be 42 degrees instead of 32.
The theatre owners united (RIAA flashback!) and worked hard to defeat the bill, saying that if it weren’t dark at night, their business would be completely decimated.
Year after year, the bill failed to pass in the UK. In the US the story was much the same.
The New York Times wrote, this is, ""little less than an act of madness.""
[more soon] later  [okay, now it’s soon…]
My very favorite quote of all comes from Mississippi.
""Repeal the law and have the clocks proclaim God’s time and tell the truth!"" That comes from Congressman Ezekiel Candler, Jr.
And Harry Hull of Iowa said, ""When we passed the law, we tried to ‘put one over’ on Mother Nature, and when you try to improve the natural laws it usually ends in disaster.""
After the law passed, there were court battles everywhere. Battles over state vs. federal jurisdiction, for example.

Geeks don’t buy expensive wine,"Four of us visited a fancy restaurant on Saturday.

You could sort by year or by price, you could see the inventory and they could remove a wine instantly once it was sold out.So what could be bad?What’s bad is that the person who’s going to spend $100 or $1,000 on a bottle of wine isn’t a hyper-rational geek in search of the optimum solution (hint: we bought the cheap stuff but it was still 5x the cost of of the wine in a store).

Is J. D. Salinger a Liar? Are You?,"Did Holden Caulfieldreallyhave the adventures and angst the author wrote about? Of course not. There wasn’t a Holden Caulfield.Catcher in the Ryeis a work of fiction.
So what’s the difference between fiction and a lie? Is storytelling lying?
I think the distinction we make for ourselves is that novelists don’t pretend that they are telling us the truth. They don’t set out to deceive because they write novels, which are clearly labeled as untrue. No evil intent, no lie.
Judging from my email and some postings on blogs here and there, it seems that some people have a trouble with the word ""liar"". Liar is a word that makes us angry.
When I wroteAll Marketers Are Liars(Liar’s Blog) I was trying to make a point about true lies.
Some (mostly those that haven’t bothered to read it) think I’m telling people to lie and cheat and deceive and abandon what few ethics we’ve got left. Nope! I’m doing the opposite.
Istartby telling you that you ARE telling a story whether you want to or not. You are a novelist, a film director, a fabulist. It’s impossible to deliver the entire truth to anyone, ever, so by making choices, you’re telling a story. If your blog is well-designed, that’s part of your story. If your blog is ugly, that’s a story too. Neither story has to do with the words. But you’re still telling a story. We as marketers ought to recognize that and start acting that way–our competition sure is.
ThenI say that telling a story that is inauthentic, inconsistent, hollow or filled with unstated side effects isn’t just wrong, it’s stupid. The best lies are true! True in the sense that you don’t disappoint the listener when she discovers more facts about what you do.
Any marketer who believes that they are in the business of telling the truth about what they do is delusional. You can’t. Not enough time, not enough attention, not enough money.
J.D. Salinger understood this when he wrote his novels. He didn’t try to tell the truth. He tried to tell a story that resonated.

Two more thoughts about podcasting,"that last post caused a minor firestorm, so I want to riff just a bit here.
1. I didn’t say I don’t like podcasts. In fact, I think they’re terrific. The user experience (take authentic, honest, informative audio with you when you do the rest of your life) is a great idea. It’s not going to go away.
2. I am fascinated by the math of the situation from the creator’s point of view.
What would have happened to radio ifa. it was really cheap to start a stationandb. the dial could hold a million stations, not forty?
We certainly wouldn’t see the huge profits and high production values of radio today, would we? If there were thousands and thousands of stations to compete with, it would be an amateur medium, with nobody making enough to invest.
Podcasting feels a little like that. There will be millions of listeners… and there might be millions of podcasts.
But, then I think about A lists. Inevitably, a few podcasts will become like boingboing, the default channel for people getting started listening, or for people who want to listen to what everyone else listens to. (and of course there will be vertical A listers… like theVarietyshowbiz journal, but someone’s podcasted version)
Is it possible to build a podcast with a million subscribers? Why not? And if you did, would it be profitable enough to invest in and dedicate time to? No doubt.
So, I guess I see a much steeper pyramid for podcasts than I do for blogs. Not 10,000,000 podcasts at the bottom the way there is for blogs, but maybe 1% of that. And a few (a dozen, a hundred, a thousand?) at the top with big subscriber numbers and either subscriber revenue or ad revenue to make it worth the investment.
If your goal is to be an A list podcaster, today’s the day to start. And invest. And persist.",,"podcasting, user experience, monetization"
Thinking about podcasting,"A few times a day, people ask when I’m going to have a podcast. My answer is probably not too soon.
The good news for podcasters is that users’ ability to hear podcasts is dramatically increasing. It’ll soon be built into itunes, and as awareness spreads, the number of listeners has to increase.
There’s a bunch of bad news, though.
First, you can’t browse a podcast. Which means that you won’t know what you like until you get it. That means subscribing in many cases. This is, of course, good news, cause subscribers are better than browsers. But it’s mostly bad news because it means that very few podcasts are going to be heard by large numbers of people.
Example: if there are 1,000 blogs and 1,000 readers, sooner or later every blog will get sampled by every reader.
BUT, if there are 1,000 podcasts and 1,000 people, it’s unlikely that you’ll be sampled by more than ten or twenty listeners. Why? Because the cost of sampling (in time) is too high. Once you’ve got your needs met, you’ll stop listening.
Problem two is that listening is a real time commitment. I can surf 300 blogs in the time I can listen to just one podcast. That doesn’t mean podcasts are bad… in fact, they’re far more powerful than blogs in selling emotion. It does mean that it’s going to be harder to get a big audience.
Which leads to the last bit of bad news: you can put up a blog post in two minutes, but it takes an hour to make a podcast. So, creators will want either big audiences or money if they’re going to really do it. And both are hard to see coming any time soon.

The Placebo Affect*,"Everybody already knows how powerful the brain is. Take a sugar pill that’s supposed to be a powerful medicine and watch your symptoms disappear. Have a surgeon not perform bypass surgery on your heart (link.) and discover that the angina that has been crippling you vanishes.
Theplacebo effectis not just for sick people anymore.
Why do some ideas have more currency than others? Because we believe they should. When Chris Anderson or Malcolm Gladwell writes about something, it’s a better idea becausetheywrote about it.
Even as your culture of ideas and marketing enters its long–tail, open-source, low-barrier, everyone-has-a-blog era of mass publication, we still need filters. Would your iPod sound as sweet if everyone else had a Rio? Would your Manolo Blahniks be as cool if everyone else were wearing Keds?
Arthur Anderson audited thousands of companies, and those audits gave us confidence in those companies, made themappearmore solid, which, not surprisingly,madethem more solid. Then, post Enron, the placebo effect disappeared. Same companies, same auditors, but suddenly those companies appeared LESS solid, which made them less solid.
The magic of the placebo effect lies in the fact that you can’t do it to yourself. You need an accomplice. Someone in authority who will voluntarily tell you a story.
That’s what marketers do. We have the“placebo affect.”(* The knack for creating placebos.) Of course, we need to persuade ourselves that it’s morally and ethically and financially okay to  participate in something as unmeasurable as the placebo effect. The effect is controversial and it goes largely unspoken. Very rarely do we come to meetings and say, “well, here’s our cool new PBX for Fortune 1000 companies. It’s exactly the same as the last model, except the phones are designed by frog design so they’re cooler and more approachable and people are more likely to invest a few minutes in learning how to use them, so customer satisfaction will go up and we’ll sell more, even though it’s precisely the same technology we were selling yesterday.”
Very rarely do vodka marketers tell the truth and say, “here’s our new vodka, which we buy in bulk from the same distillery that produces vodka for $8 a bottle. Ours is going to cost $35 a bottle and come in a really, really nice bottle and our ads will persuade laddies that this will help them in the dating department… nudge, nudge, know what I mean, nudge, nudge…”
It would be surprising to meet a monk or a talmudic scholar or a minister who would say, “yes, we burn the incense or turn down the lights or ring these bells or light these candles as a way of creating a room where people are more likely to believe in their prayers,” but of course that’s exactly what they’re doing. (and you know what? there’s nothing wrong with that.)
It’s easier to get people to come to a meeting about clock speed and warranty failure analysis than it is to have a session about storytelling.
We don’t like to admit that we tell stories, that we’re in the placebo business. Instead, we tell ourselves about features and benefits as a way to rationalize our desire to to help our customers by allowing them to lie to themselves.
The design of your blog or your package or your outfit is nothing but an affect designed to create the placebo effect. The sound Dasani water makes when you open the bottle is more of the same. It’s all storytelling. It’s all lies.

$17 billion a year,"Do you have a lawn?
You know, the wasteful green expanse in front of your house… that kind of lawn.
It turns out that lawns were virtually unknown in the USA until after 1850, and were invented in the UK not too long before this.
The reason for a lawn? To demonstrate wastefulness. A lawn tells your neighbors you can afford to waste land, waste water and have a team of servants to keep it all pretty (History of Lawns In America.)
The marketing of lawns is true marketing. Not interruptive clever ads, but an idea that spreads and sticks. Just like Starbucks. Or e-mail. The challenge facing industries and organizations is to create ideas that have the marketing built in.
You don’t have a front lawn so your kids can practice soccer. You have one so your spouse won’t yell at you for embarrassing the family in front of the neighbors.

A letter from Kentucky,"Jeff Reed writes,
I am the music director of an orchestra that is entering its sixth season, which is located in a town of 50,000 people.  Our budget was about $15,000 the first season and it will be nearly $500,000 this season.  We have always had balanced budgets and will finish this season (ends July 1) with about a $20,000 surplus.  This is happening at a time when many orchestras have ended in bankruptcy or are finishing with large deficits.  I owe much of our success to you.
Having read several studies on why orchestras are failing, I have learned (which came as no surprise), that people these days don’t want to hear one type of music (which is what orchestras usually offer-only classical) and that audiences get bored without a visual element in a concert (merely watching the musicians isn’t enough).
To respond to these studies, we created what we think is a purple cow:  an orchestra that programs Beethoven and the Beatles on the same concert (usually, orchestras perform only ""serious"" music on one concert and have a pops orchestra to do the ""light"" stuff–they usually use two different orchestra names, even though the same musicians do both concerts!).  All of our concerts are centered around themes which tie the various musical styles together, often with an added visual element on a screen above the orchestra. For example, we did ""That ’20s Show"" which featured ""serious"" music from the 1920’s by Shostakovich, a commissioned film score to accompany a silent film (the orchestra played the score while the audience watched the film on a screen above the orchestra), and popular songs by George and Ira Gershwin.   We did a bluegrass concert that featured Copland’s ""Appalachian Spring,"" standards performed by a Bluegrass band, and a new composition for bluegrass band and orchestra.
I don’t know how remarkable all of this is nationally or internationally, but it is certainly working in Bowling Green, KY.  Our audiences have grown from 100 the first season to an average of 800 this past season (some concerts sell as many as 2,000 tickets).
I just finished reading ""All Marketers Are Liars.""  My question is:  what story are we telling or should we be telling?  It seems like we are telling quite a few, for example: (1) orchestras don’t have to be boring (which deals with a common perception); (2) We think outside the Bachs (sorry for the pun), which seems to make people feel good about the fact that they want to hear several different types of music and that they aren’t stupid if they get bored listening to some classical music.  All of our season themes are along those lines:  Anything Goes, Thinking Outside the Bachs, Bluegrass to Baroque, etc.
I thought it would be fun to answer Jeff’s questions on the blog… The fact is, he’s already 99% of the way there (through no fault of mine!)
Most orchestras are run by people who are focused on the ""truth"" of what they do. They are performing the canon, doing it with skill and passion. They offer their community the best of what they are able to produce, and hope that those that are intelligent and genteel enough appreciate what they have to offer. If people don’t come, it’s some sort of commentary on the declining state of our culture, not, in their view, a reflection of the story they’re telling.
Every once in a while, a traditional orchestra decides to go slumming to raise money. They program a Pops concert or bring in PDQ Bach. The problem with this is that they’re still talking to the very people they always talk to, so it’s not enough. That, and because it’s seen as an extra, a lesser task, few orchestras really get very good at this sort of programming.
Jeff, on the other hand, has figured out a totally different way to look at the situation. It starts by understanding worldview. There is certainly a tiny population in Bowling Green that walks around with the worldview, ""I love traditional classical music and will pay to see it live."" These people would be an easy sale, but there are very very few of them.
There’s a much larger group that has a worldview that says, ""I’m interested in live music and enjoy an evening out. I want to do something fun and something that doesn’t make me bored or feel stupid."" These people are the kind of people who read movie reviews and movie ads–not because they have to, but because they want to. They are the kind of people who don’t skip over the entertainment section of their local paper.
In walks Jeff’s group with a simple story, well told. ""We’re not slumming, we don’t look down on you and we’re here to have fun, too."" By taking advantage of clever programming, slide shows and other non-traditional techniques, Jeff is busy putting on a show–a show that people want to hear.
I don’t think Jeff needs help telling his story. The challenge is now to make it easy for people to tell that story to their friends. I’d obsess about getting permission from my fans (via email, or a traditional newsletter) and then deliver regularly news to them that’s easy to spread. I’d offer ""bring a friend"" evenings and discounts, and start programming in venues outside of the traditional theatre.
The takeaway here is that if your target audience isn’t listening, it’s not their fault, it’s yours. If one story isn’t working, change what you do, not how loudly you yell (or whine). Nice work, Jeff.",,"Orchestra, Programming, Audience Engagement"
The Knut Masco story,"This is a true story of the Net, of talent and trust. It’s a small world.
Fifteen years ago, on the streets of Soho (the artsy district of Manhattan) my wife and I were window-shopping for art we couldn’t afford. Outside of one of the galleries, literally on the street, we saw an artist selling his work right on the street. We bought a painting for about $100 and congratulated ourselves for ""buying art in Soho"" at a discount. The artist was friendly and we wished him luck.
Knut Masco, the artist, specialized in painting on the back of old windows. He decorated the wooden frame and painted on the glass. He was a committed street artist and made a name for himself when he joined in with some other artists and sued Rudi Guiliani for banning their work (a surprisingly large number of people don’t remember the original bully version of Guiliani). They won and that was the last we heard of Knut.
Anyway, two months ago the Masco in our house fell off the wall and shattered into a billion pieces. We were heartbroken. ""This is a job for google"" I cried, and off I went to find Knut. Nothing doing. He had vanished.
I hopped over to the amazingGoogle Answers. I posted a query and within a day, the researcher found Knut… living in Israel… under another name… no longer doing art!
I dropped Knut a note, found out his new name was Boaz, and described our need for a new painting. He quickly agreed–even though he couldn’t find any old windows and had to make a new one from scratch. Even though he hadn’t painted in a while. I offered to pay in advance, but he wouldn’t hear of it.
Two months later, I get an email saying the painting is ready and has been shipped. I send him a check, made out to his new name, on faith. A day later, a painting arrives by Federal Express. From Israel. With a handwritten invoice.
The painting is terrific–even better than the original. But more important to us is the story. Not sure what you can do with it, but thought you’d want to hear it.",,"Knut Masco, trust, art"

All (successful) politicians are liars,"And that’s because citizens demand that they lie. And we’re getting what we deserve.I listened to a debate on the radio yesterday betweenDavid Keene, chairman of the American Conservative UnionandRalph Neas, president of People for the American Way. It was about the upcoming US Senate vote about filibusters. Ostensibly, this was a thoughtful, public-radio exposition of the facts and thoughts behind each side of the debate. It was nothing of the sort.BRILLIANTThat’s the only word to describe David’s approach. He told a story about fairness. He used phrases like, “up or down vote” and “nominees who have been held hostage for four years” and “what’s in the Constitution.” He spoke calmly and reasonably and never wavered from the story he wanted to tell. If you were inclined to believe his story, it was easy to believe. More important, it was easy to spread.INCOMPETENTRalph Neas approached it like a Moot Court debater. He talked about how Robert Byrd’s previous motions (fifteen years ago) were fundamentally different. Who exactly cares about Robert Byrd? He talked about how the Republicans had filibustered forty (forty!) years ago with Abe Fortas. Ralph may very well have been right about the facts, but it doesn’t matter, does it?[When marketers talk about politics (and when politicians talk about marketing) it almost always ends up as a degraded conversation because people get emotional over their points of view. That’s not what I’m talking about here. What I’m talking about is the consistent bungling of the Democratic Party as they fail to tell stories that people want to hear.]John Kerry lost to an unpopular incumbent seeking reelection for just one reason: he insisted on focusing on facts, on issues, on position papers and on nuance. He acted like an intellectual bully, refusing to worry about the story he told. George W. Bush, on the other hand, was absolutely masterful in the way he told a story that a portion of the electorate wanted to hear.It may be, that like me, you wish that all issues were decided on facts and reliable data. They never are. We’re people, not machines, and we believe stories, not facts.Ralph Neas doesn’t appear to understand this. If I had been him, I would have repeated the mantra,Antonin Scaliaover and over again. I would have talked about what will happen if the court has three more Scalia’s on it. I’d tell that story calmly and carefully and repeatedly. Not everyone dislikes Scalia. That’s okay. You’re never going to persuade everyone of anything. What you can do, though, is persuade the persuadable, persuade the people who are choosing to listen and are open to believing the story you want to tell.","May 21, 2005","politics, storytelling, persuasion"

Fundable… a next big thing?,"Anders Abrahamsson points us to Fundable, a new open source venture.Welcome to Fundable — Fundable.
I post it becausea. the site is beautiful and clear and is a great example of the sort of Knock Knock website we need more of.b. more important, I think it represents a neat opportunity for marketers of content.
Example: Rickie Lee Jones says, ""If 5,000 people agree to buy a new live album from me $10 a copy as an MP3, I’ll go ahead and make it."" She then promotes the sale and points people to Fundable.
If she doesn’t get 5,000, everyone gets a refund, automatically. If she does, she sends out the album and something good has happened.
What’s neat about this is that it creates a fundamentally different sort of buying mechanism. That hasn’t happened in a long, long time.
I actually don’t think that this is going to be a truly next big thing… it’s too much work to do the promotion and to make something worth buying. (Imagine chartering a big jet to Las Vegas for a convention…) But it’s a cool idea.",,"Fundable, crowdfunding, marketing"
Whatever happened to ChangeThis?,"A year ago today, I started work onChangeThis.The idea was to have a mechanism that would help thoughtful ideas spread. Far too lazy to do something this difficult on my own, I assembled a team of summer interns who did the entire thing.
It succeeded beyond our wildest expectations. We featured authors as diverse as Tom Peters, Amnesty International, Chris Anderson, Hugh Macleod, George Lakoff and Guy Kawaski. We distributed manifestos on the evil of juice and the joys of blogging. Millions and millions of copies of our pdf files were distributed far and wide.
ChangeThis, paradoxically, wastoosuccessful. As the bar was raised and the standards increased, the amount of work necessary to keep up the quality kept rising. Starting at the end of last year, I entered into a very long negotiation with a major web company about passing the reins on to them. Alas, as often happens with long negotiations with major corporations, it crashed and burned at the very end. One side effect is that ChangeThis has been relatively bereft of new content since February or so.
The good news?a. next week I hope to be able to tell you about a new team taking over–no money is changing hands, just a team of folks who want to do the hard work to make it fly…andb. we learned a lot. We learned a lot building it and launching it, and we learned a lot in watching what spread (and what didn’t spread). And, I think, our millions of readers learned a lot.
So, think hard about the next generation of manifestos. Challenge yourself to write something that’s important, and that will spread. More next week. Thanks for reading.",,"ChangeThis, manifestos, content"

More downgrading,"A few weeks ago, I talked about the gradual descent of music from live to a mere memory of that:Seth’s Blog: REAL–Compared to what? The Pale Imitation.
I thought about that when I was yelling on the cell phone today, because the connection was far worse than the way the phone in my house sounded in 1971.
And the typesetting on my blog doesn’t compare to that in my books.
And my digital pictures in iphoto, though there are a lot of them, really don’t look as sharp as these snapshots from my high school graduation (and I had more hair).
It’s not just traditional media, either. An email doesn’t communicate as much information as a meeting, and a voice mail is really hard to file. A Powerbar may have plenty of vitamins and stuff, but it’s just not as good as a real meal, is it?

"Stagnation is easy, change is hard","They want to make the supermarket near my house better. Add free parking for all the people who want to shop in the village (where there is no free parking). Add more fresh produce and organic foods, as well as an enhanced deli/prepared food section. They also want to take over an abandoned lot where a car dealership stood abandoned for years, and eliminate a little-used street that messes up the traffic.
The town is up in arms!
There are petitions everywhere. People are outraged. Shocked. It’ll ruin everything.
It seems as though it’s easy to be against change.
There’s a toxic waste dump in my town, crowned by an old, rusting, abandoned water tower. There’s actually a committee to protect the water tower, given that it signifies an important part of our (toxic) heritage.
One more:
New York State fought for years (and spent millions on legal work) to keep a law that is patently ridiculous–that only in-state wineries could sell online and by mail. Somehow, I guess, the in-state wineries would avoid selling to minors, but not the ones from, say, California.
One day after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the law, our esteemed governor said that he was in favor of changing it anyway. No big deal. The world did not end.
Why is it so easy to protect the status quo, even when the status quo isn’t so great?
It has to do with a discontinuity on the curve of gain and loss. Think about it this way:
How much would you pay for a long long shot chance to win $100 million? Odds of a billion to one. Probably a dollar. They call it a lottery ticket.
Now, how much would you SELL a long long shot (at even better odds) where if a certain number came up, you’d have to give away every single item you owned?
Figure you’d lose a million dollars worth of assets. Now, before you answer, remember that this is just 1% of what you were willing to pay a dollar to win. The rational mathematical answer is no more than one penny. Of course, no one would sell this ticket for a penny. Most people wouldn’t sell it for a thousand dollars. A thousand dollars for a 100,000 to one shot you’ll go bankrupt? No way.
The fear of loss is way, way higher than the desire for gain. Unless it’s carefully hidden inside a story, that’s the way we feel. We’re humans, not Vulcans.
If I ran the Stop & Shop supermarket near my house, I’d bluff. I’d pull bulldozers and wrecking balls into town and tell everyone I was going to demolish my no longer profitable store and then leave the parking lot filled with bricks so no one could park there and jog over the wine store while using my parking lot.
The outrage would be so profound I’d have no trouble at all selling the town on a small upgrade.
All change isn’t good. Not at all. But the knee jerk irrational opposition to change is less good. Marketing is all about making change. More often than not, a good way to sell that change is not with the promise for gain. It’s with the fear of loss. Sad but true.",,"Change, Stagnation, Fear of Loss"

Hostage to the fans (and the bureaucracy),"Ramit Sethi points me to:New eBay Stores Logo.
This is astonishing big company doubletalk. First, that they’d change the logo at all, second that they’d study it so much, third that they’d bother telling anyone about it, and last that they’d write this much.
Talk about being afraid (of criticism). Here’s the riff:
eBay Stores is getting a whole new look!We will soon be replacing the existing eBay Stores logo with a new eBayStores logo. The change will take effect on the U.S. eBay site in Juneand on all international eBay sites in July.
The new logo is made up of theeBay logo and the word ""stores"" in a new, professional-looking,easy-to-read typeface. It is followed by a graphic of an open door,layered on top of multiple doors.

The decision to redesign theeBay Stores logo was based on Community feedback and extensive buyerand seller research that was done during the past year, where we foundthat that existing red tag logo inaccurately reflected what an eBayStore is today. With this in mind, we decided it was time to replacethe ""red tag"" logo with a new brand identity that better reflects whatStore sellers and buyers tell us is a key part of their Storesexperience: opportunity, trust and convenience.
We understand that this new symbol foreBay Stores can be interpreted in many ways. Our interpretation is thatthe logo communicates openness and trust, inviting shoppers to comeinside and take a look. For sellers, it means opportunity to build andgrow your business on eBay and for buyers the convenient opportunity tofind the items that you’ve been looking for. Finally, the multipledoors represent the many businesses that make up the eBay Storescommunity. We hope that this will resonate well with existing eBaybuyers and sellers as well as visitors who first come to eBay.
We recognize that the upcomingchange may cause disruption to your business as you start toincorporate the new logo into your eBay listings and Store. Please beassured that we received and incorporated input from many eBaycommunity members before making the decision to change the logo. Toease the transition for existing eBay Stores sellers, we are providingthe new logos for you todownloadso that you can begin updating any printed materials, listings or other collateral pieces well in advance of the change.",,"eBay, logo redesign, community feedback"

How cool is this,"Michael Duffy rates 2,767 winery web sites on effectiveness. He then sells a customized report to any winery that cares to pay for it.Home Page – The Winery Web Site Report.
This is the new sort of non-fiction publishing model that is going to demolish the old one (at least from an economic point of view). At $500 a copy, the report is almost certainly worth the money. And at $500 a copy, a customized overview is also quite profitable for the author. And finally, at $500, it’s an effective calling card that builds his business among a (very small but important to him) target market.
In an earlier time, you’d publish a book on the topic, wait a year for it to come out, reach 10% of the possible audience and lose money in the process. I love the idea that a big part of the report is customized. Not hard to do, worth a lot more.

We have no choice.Consider this story courtesy of Boing Boing:VANCOUVER, British Columbia (Reuters) – A lazy worker, not a satanic cult, was responsible for severed goat heads that caused a scare at a Vancouver-area school, Canadian police said on Monday.Police were called in after goat heads were twice found on a bench outside a school in nearby Chilliwack, British Columbia, prompting fears in the suburban community that it had been targeted by a satanic animal killing.A 19-year-old worker at a local slaughterhouse has admitted he took the two heads with the intention of having them mounted, but then changed his mind and left them at the school in hopes a janitor would dispose of them.“(Police) want to reassure the community that there were no satanic intentions in relation to these incidents,” the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said, adding that the man “should have known better.”","May 14, 2005","satanic cult, goat heads, Vancouver"

"Same people, different moment","It’s easy to get hung up on demographics when you buy advertising. This is probably a mistake.
Consider this insight from Pamela Parker  (Lessons from the Cutting Edge: RSS Advertising.) ""It turns outthe ads on the site are geared toward an audience of people who arediscovering the content — product information — via a search engine.Because these folks are at a certain, and very attractive, stage in thebuying cycle, advertisers are willing to pay higher prices. Its feedsubscribers, on the other hand, may or may not be in the same stage ofthe buying cycle — they just happen to be interested in that categoryof product.""
Short version: a person’s receptiveness to an ad changes based on where they are and what they’re doing. Google AdWords are brilliant for just this reason. People are trained to Google in order to go somewhere else. Most sites train people to come and to stay. Same thing is true with magazines.

Indecency,"So, the reporter from the LA Times started with this question,“Why do you think the cable TV people are using the Internet to fight the government’s attempts to expand their crackdown on broadcast indency to cable?”That’s when you know which side has already won the debate.How can you be againstindency? How can you argue against acrackdown?Would the question have been just as accurate if it had been, “Why do you think the cable TV people are using the Internet to fight the government’s assault on the first amendment as it tries to censor and control what adults choose to watch on paid TV in the privacy of their homes?”It’s easy to assume that I’m just playing with words here. I’m not. The words that are used in any debate are at the heart of the story we tell ourselves.One side often tries to rely onfacts, on thetruth, on what’sright. The other side tells a story that fits our worldview. Who wins?The storytellers will win every time.Try for a moment to divorce the way you feel about this issue (personally, I’m sort of ambivalent) and take a look at the tactics. They are precisely the tactics that a wi-fi router manufacturer needs to use, or someone searching for a job.Yes, it feels Orwellian. It doesn’t seem fair that it’s not just good enough to be correct or qualified or the best value. That’s not even close to what it takes to succeed in today’s marketplace of ideas. Instead, you must frame your message in a way that gives people a story that matches their worldview.I heard a spokesperson for the governor of Missouri on the radio today. She was supporting the governor’s claim that eliminating Medicaid in Missouri was a moral, socially acceptable act of generosity. She explained how unfair it was for taxpayers to subsidize health care for the poor, and that in fact, eliminating health care for the poor might be quite positive because it would encourage people to go out and get a job. She did this in a calm and reasonable manner, and you could hear the foundation being built. After all, how can you be against people going out and getting a job? How can you be against people keeping their own money… If this story fits your worldview, I’m sure it sounds reasonable and believable. If it doesn’t, the story won’t persuade you. That’s the way marketing works–you don’t persuade people with your story, you just give people who already agree with you the tools they need to persaude their friends.","May 13, 2005","indecency, storytelling, marketing"
Do you judge a book by its cover?,"I do.
It’s a horrible habit, I admit it. But do I have any other choice? With 95,000 books published every year (in the USA alone), how on earth are you supposed to spend the time to read books with bad covers?
Of course, it’s not just books. We judge magazines, restaurants, even people by their covers. (and especially web sites!) And as a result, we end up skipping great meals, not getting to know terrific people and missing all sorts of terrific opportunities as a result.
So, here’s what I do about it:
1. I try to find things with lousy covers and go out of my way to check them out. If the herd is drawn to the obvious, flashy cover, then I’m not going to find insightful, rare information where everyone else is. The unique stuff is hiding.
2. I try to make covers that don’t sabatoge the work. It’s astonishing to me how many packages, jackets, labels, signs and outfits are chosen because they’re safe, boring and invisible instead of for the only reason that matters–to sell the prospect on finding out what’s inside.","May 12, 2005","book covers, judgment, unique insights"
If you have a web site,"I hope you’ll do two things.
First, wait patiently until Monday when I show you my new ebook about web pages and conversion.
Second, don’t wait even one minute before checking out:Call To Action: How to Improve Your Conversion Rate. The authors sent me a copy a few weeks ago, but I was too busy writing my ebook to read this. A shame, because I could have stolen countless ideas from them. It’s filled with all the facts and details and case studies that I was far too lazy to include in my ebook.
Despite the godawful cover, this book is an astonishing bargain. The book is straightforward and gives you direct, clear insight into what’s wrong with your site and what to do about it. No fancy metaphors or engaging banter. Just the nuts and bolts and the facts to back them up.

We and They,"In March, Fred Wilson (a must read) posted an essay on companies that are either ""we"" or ""they"". You can find it here:A VC: Apple Becomes a ""They"" Company.
The post created a lot of comments and trackbacks, and it just dawned on me what was missing for me.
I don’t think We and They are absolutes. For example, if there were just one Starbucks in the world, and it was just down the street from you, you’d likely feel differently about ""your"" Starbucks than you feel about the entire chain. Why? ""Your"" Starbucks would be identical, but your feelings would change.
Same thing happens when Apple starts litigating against websites or bullying people writing add-ons to iTunes. It doesn’t change your Mac, your user experience.
What changes is the story you tell yourself.
As everyone in the world becomes a marketing expert and a blogger, we’re spending a lot more time thinking about the brands we deal with, the purchases we make and the we and the they. I want to argue that there’s no such thing as we and they. What is really going on is that companies take actions that have nothing to do with the truth of your experience and everything to do with the way you feel about the experience. These actions (like Apple’s suit against thinksecret.com) are the hood ornament, not the car.
And more often than not, those actions are somewhat trivial and very inexpensive. Once companies (and non-profits, for that matter, like churches or government agencies) become more aware of how important these hood ornaments are, I’m betting they’ll get better at telling the story.",,"We and They, Brand Perception, Consumer Experience"

The end of the cosmic jukebox,"The other day, I found myself sitting next to Robert Klein at Spamalot. When I was a forlorn teenager, I would spend hours listening to his comedy albums. I memorized his ad for ""every record ever recorded… we drive a truck to your house."" I resisted temptation and did not recite it for him on Saturday (though I still know it by heart. ""Lithuanian Language Records!"")
For a long time, I figured that the inevitable was just about to happen. That every record ever recorded would find its way online and if you had a big enough hard drive, you could have them all.

I no longer believe you can have every record ever recorded. I now know for certain that by the time they drive a truck to your house, a thousand new records will be made.
When everybody can make everything, the amount of clutter reaches a whole new level. When everybody can make everything (Handmade custom Pez dispensers) then the whole idea of clutter at this level changes the way you need to think about supply and demand.

What I learned at summer camp,"My friend Tim dropped me a note, asking me if I had any tips as to where he might go to improve his public speaking. I was flattered that he asked, and then took a minute to think about where I learned how to speak in public.
Answer?Camp Arowhon.
Wait, there's more. I also learned marketing there.
My summer camp was a marketplace (a loud one). Everyone had to do something, but what you did was up to you. So the canoeing instructor (that was me) was always struggling with the sailing instructor (that was Mike) and the others to get people to come to our dock. If no one came, you were a failure and you didn't get asked back.
I discovered that:1. No one cared about me. They didn't care about how hard I'd trained, how little I'd slept or how much effort I was putting into my job.2. People were rarely willing to try something new. If they'd never done it, they didn't want to start any time soon.3. Word of mouth was electric.4. You get more chances to screw up than you imagine.
The biggest and best discovery, though, was how willing people (even sullen teenagers, which if you think selling to cranky purchasing agents is hard…) are to suspend disbelief. One week, I persuaded 300 people that Paul McCartney was coming to visit, checking the place out for his daughter. It was only at the last minute, when a friend of mine, impersonating Sir Paul, fell out of the approaching motorboat and was (allegedly) mangled by the spinning rotor that people figured out that it wasn't really him.
My point, and I do have one, is that marketing is a show, a Judy Garland/Mickey Rooney entertainment designed to satisfy wants, not needs. We need to take it a lot less seriously (even if we're marketing Social Security fixes or a world religion) at the same time that we take more risks. If you're not growing now, playing it safe isn't going to help you grow tomorrow.
My advice was Tim is the same advice I've got for you, whether you're speaking or running ads. Be fearless. (but wear a lifejacket.)","May 11, 2005","public speaking, marketing, fearlessness"

Costa Rican Tilapia,"That’s what the sign said at the fancy fish market in Manhattan. It was more than $10 a pound, and it sure sounded exotic.It turns out that Costa Rican tilapia is grown in backyard ponds by women just like this one. Here’s’s a picture I took of her, kissing our fish before cleaning it on the open-air table in her backyard. She grows 500 at a time, has a dozen or so chickens for eggs, and she’s a lot better off (and doing a lot more long term good) than the rancher next door.A tilapia from this wonderful person costs about seventy-five cents.When you see the sign in New York, though, you imagine spear fisherman or spring-fed crystal clear rivers. You certainly don’t think you’re buying a home-farmed commodity.Somewhere between cheap protein near the equator and my home in New York, the price and the value of the fish skyrocketed.Not because of the cost of shipping. Because of the story. Tilapia sounds exotic. Costa Ricaisexotic. Put them together and amateur chefs are ready to line up and pay a premium.Is someone getting ripped off here? Of course not. Chowhounds like me want to buy something that sounds exotic. Fish mongers want to find new supplies of fish and also want to charge enough to cover their risk. And my friend in Costa Rica certainly deserves the higher prices she’ll get if her fish becomes popular in the United States.

"On Critics, Criticism and Remarkability","So, why haven’t you and your team launched as manyPurple Cows as you’d like?
Fear.
Not just the fear of failure. Fear of failure is actually overrated as an excuse. Why? Because if you work for someone, then more often than not, the actual cost of the failure is absorbed by the organization, not you. If your product launch fails, they’re not going to fire you. The company will make a bit less money and will move on.
What people are afraid of isn’t failure. It’s blame. Criticism.
We don’tchooseto be remarkable because we’re worried about criticism. We hesitate to create innovative movies, launch new human resource initiatives, design a menu that makes diners take notice or give an audacious sermon because we’re worried, deep down, that someone will hate it and call us on it.
“That’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard!” “What a waste of money.” “Who’s responsible for this?”
Sometimes, the criticism doesn’t even have to be that obvious. The fear of, “I’m surprised you launched this without doing more research…” is enough to get many people to do a lot more research, to study something to death and then kill it. Hey, at least you didn’t get criticized.
Fear of criticism is a powerful deterrent because the criticism doesn’t actually have to occur for the fear to set in. Watch a few people get criticized for being innovative and it’s pretty easy to persuade yourself that the very same thing will happen to you if you’re not careful.
Constructive criticism, of course, is a terrific tool. If a critic tells you that, “I don’t like it,” or “this is disappointing,” he’s done no good at all. In fact, quite the opposite is true. He’s used his power to injure without giving you any information to help you to do better next time. Worse, he hasn’t given those listening any data to make a thoughtful decision on their own. Not only that, but by refusing to reveal the basis for his criticism, he’s being a coward, because there’s no way to challenge his opinion.
I admit it. When I get a bad review, my feelings are hurt. After all, it would be nice if a critic said a title of mine was a breakthrough, an inspirational, thoughtful book that explains how everything, from politics to wine, is marketed through stories.
But sometimes they don’t. Which is just about enough to ruin your day. But this time, it didn’t. It didn’t because I realized what a badge of honor it is get a bit of shallow criticism. It means that I confounded expectations. That I didn’t deliver the sequel or the simple, practical guide that some expected. It means that in fact, I did something worth remarking on.
The lesson here is this: if I had written a boring book, there’d be no criticism. No conversations.The products and services that get talked about are the ones that are worth talking about.
So the challenge, as you contemplate your next opportunity to be boring or remarkable, is to answer these two and a half questions:
1.    “If I get criticized for this, will I suffer any measurable impacts? Will I lose my job, get hit upside the head with a softball bat or lose important friendships?” If the only side effect of the criticism is that you will feel bad about the criticism, then you have to compare that bad feeling with the benefits you’ll get from actually doing something worth doing. Being remarkable is exciting, fun, profitable and great for your career. Feeling bad wears off.
And then, once you’ve compared the two, and you’ve sold yourself on taking the remarkable path, answer this one:
2.    How can I create something that critics will criticize?",,"Criticism, Fear, Remarkability"

What Every Good Marketer Knows,"“Godin reinforces what good marketers know.”The New York Times
I’m flattered! I wasn’t sure I knew what every good marketer knows. I guess I do now. But, assuming that you’re like me and the rest of the people I know (which means you haven’t figured out everything there is to know about marketing yet), here’s a list to get you started.
I’m confident that the trackbacks below this post will show you what some of the great marketers out there would add to this list.
Obviously, knowing what to do is very, very different than actually doing it.
[irony alert: since the inspiration for this post has been misinterpreted a couple of times, I wanted to clarify: the New York Times wasn’t trying to be nice when they said what they said… even though it seems nice to you and me, they didn’t mean it that way. And this list didn’t appear in the Times, it was inspired by their attempt to be snide. Thank you.]",,"marketing, expert, insight"
Heart Surgeons are Liars,"Dr. Nortin Hadler, professor of medicine at UNC knows what he’s talking about. He’s spent the last thirty years examining the stats associated with various medical interventions… and he’s written up some of his results in theJournal of the American Medical Association. He’s got a new book out, and some of the takeaway is startling.It turns out that bypass surgery (which is incredibly expensive, quite risky and leads half of the patients to suffer depression and a third to have measurable memory loss) doesno good at all.None.In one study, half the angina patients waiting for surgery got nothing but a cut in the chest–no surgery. The other half had the surgery. The results? The placebo group enjoyed the same improvements as those that had the “real” surgery.Of course, if surgery works–even pretend surgery–it’s real. It turns out that something as examined and life-threatening as heart surgery is no different than a wine glass or an iPod. It’s the way you feel, not what is really happening.So, if it’s so obvious, why do we still cut so many people open? Because of worldview. Hey, it’s your heart. You better do everything you can to protect yourself. Take no chances. Cut no corners. That’s the story we desperately want to hear. I predict it’ll take at least 20 years before bypasses go away.(for those considering bypass surgery: I’m not a doctor. I don’t even play one on TV. I haven’t done all the research, and I’m naturally hyperbolic. Consider this a grain of salt.)","May 7, 2005","Heart surgery, placebo, medical intervention"
The New Digital Divide,"A few years ago, pundits were quite worried about theDigital divide.The short definition is that the haves would have reliable, fast access to the Net, which would give them employment and learning opportunities that others wouldn’t be able to get. This would further divide those with a head start from everyone else. Wiring the schools in the US was one response to the threat of this divide.
I think anewdivide has opened up, one that is based far more onchoicethan on circumstance. Several million people (and the number is growing, daily) have chosen to become the haves of the Internet, and at the same time that their number is growing, so are their skills.

















Does it surprise you that more thanhalfof the hundreds of thousands ofBoing Boingreaders use Firefox? That’s about five times the number you’d expect. It turns out that a lot of these tech-friendly behaviors come in bunches. Someone who has a few of these behaviors is likely to have most of them. (and no, this is by no means a complete list. I’m sure the blog community will find twenty others and post them in a day or two!)
So what? Why should you care if a bunch of nerds are learning a lot of cool new stuff?
Well, five years ago, geeks pretty much kept to themselves. They’d be sitting in IRC chat, or arguing about Unix vs. Linux, but it didn’t spread very fast and it didn’t influence the rest of the world outside the tech community.
Today, though, the Net is far more robust and far more ubiquitous than it used to be. And it’s bloggers who are setting the agenda on everything from politics to culture. It’s bloggers that journalists and politicians look to as the first and the loudest.
As a result, your most-connected, most influential customers are part of the digerati. They can make or break your product, your service or even your religion’s new policies. Because the Net is now a broadcast (and a narrowcast) medium, the digerati can spread ideas.
The second thing to keep in mind is that the digerati are using the learning tools built into the Net to get smarter, faster. A new Net tool can propogate to millions in just a week or two. Unlike the old digital divide, this means that the divide between the digerati and the rest of the world is accelerating.
So, it’s choice time. Several of my colleagues (tompeters!being a notable example) are jumping in with both feet. Others take a look at the headstart and decide that it’s just too much work.
Try to imagine doing your work today without email. It’s inconceivable. I think the tools of the digerati are going to be just as essential in just a moment or two. You can wait until Microsoft issues them all as a dumbed down package, but if you do, you’ll not only miss the texture and understanding that comes from learning as you go, but you’ll always be trying to catch up.
I can’t decide if I’m really anusor athem.I’ve got all the tools above, but it’s still hard work. The good news, though, is that you won’t break anything if you try these new tools and commit yourself to understanding the new digerati. Better hurry, though, because they won’t wait for you.",,"Digital Divide, Digerati, Internet Tools"

The Runaway Bride,"[Actual overheard phone conversation, yesterday, in a company that books music for parties]“So, you want to reduce the number of musicians from 9 to 6?”“Do you mind if I ask a question… is it because of the cost?”slight sneer “Hmmm, well I’m sure we’ll still be able to provide you with something special.”“Now, for the reception… you’ll want classical musicians, of course.”The American bride’s worldview is a twisted, scary place. It’s not only about creating a special day, a day just for you, a day that you’ll remember, a day that you’ve dreamed of forever, a day where you are the princess you’d always like to be, but it’s also filled with doubt and self-esteem issues.Why do we “need” $9,000 worth or flowers or a dress that averages $799? (Aside: if the average price of a wedding dress is $800, that means that most brides are spending close to their entire annual discretionary income on an article of clothing that will be worn exactly once). The reason, of course, is that on this day, the way you feel is everything. Nobody NEEDS a wedding. And the way you feel is largely driven by your expectation of how others expect you to behave.The entire wedding industry is built on a lie. The lie is a story that says, “if your wedding doesn’t include at least all of thestandarditems, you’re not special.”You knew all this of course. I’m just reminding you because when you see something so perfectly executed, it’s worth noting.As a marketer, I’d be more inclined to sell the over-the-top fantasy stuff like a wedding at Disney with Mickey as best man.

Brownian motion at work,"My friend Jeremy gave me a riff aboutBrownian motion – Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.
Brownian motion describes the random motion of a particle in liquid. Why random? Because a particle hits something and bounces off in a new direction. Do this often enough and it’s basically impossible to predict what will happen next.
Brownian motion only occurs with particles that aren’t very goal motivated. You probably know people like this. They start doing one thing, hit an obstacle and suddenly flop into a totally new direction.
Are your co-workers Brownian? How about your projects?",,"Brownian motion, random motion, unpredictability"
Some people want a hand held,"My fish store sells plenty of Fish Rub. If you’re a cook, the label may look familiar. The product is made by the producer of one of the best kinds of paprika.Guess what’s inside the box? Mostly paprika. You could make your own Fish Rub at home in seconds if you had, say, some salt and maybe a little pepper.But if the box said Paprika, the Fish Rub customers wouldn’t nibble, never mind bite. Why? Because they have a worldview that says that they know how to heat things up, not how to cook. Paprika is a cooking word. Fish Rub is a heating things up word.","May 3, 2005","Fish Rub, paprika, cooking"
I bet you think this post is about you,"The other day, my new friendTuckertold me that I was a, ""massive egomaniac.""
Aren’t all bloggers?
What sort of ego do bloggers have? We spend the time and the energy and the money to post our opinions to the world, and we do it daily, or even hourly, often on topics on which we have no obvious authority…
Ego is the biggest reason that corporate blogging may be an oxymoron. Working for the man often means subsuming your ego to that of the organization, and blogging makes that difficult. It’s one reason that there have been high profile firings of corporate bloggers at places like Google. It’s hard to have two voices (the writer’s and the shareholders’) competing and often conflicting.
""Egomaniac"", by the way, is the wrong word. I think that blogging requires you to have a healthy respect for your opinions, as well as the generous desire to share them with others. That’s not a negative social trait… If you don’t respect your opinions, who will? And if you don’t want to share the ideas you admire, you’re being selfish, aren’t you?",,"blogging, ego, corporate culture"
Boring and successful means boring and cheap,"The reason Carly had so much trouble at HP is that they were under too much pressure from Dell. If you’re going to be the standard, you need to be boring. If you’re boring, you’ve got to be cheap. Cheap and standard is what Dell does best, and I don’t see how you can beat them at that game.

Hello?,"More on talking ducks, priests and rabbis…
Rereading the post below about my vacation memo it’s possible to imagine thatthis was a plea not to send me notes. No, that’s exactly the opposite ofwhat I was getting at. Have you ever noticed that almost everyone youknow talks to you on the phone with the same set of rules? Same pauses,same volume, same conventions?
The word ""hello"" was invented by Thomas Edison as a gift for Alexander Graham Bell. Before ""hello"" there was no polite way to start a phone conversation (proper people were introduced, they didn’t just greet each other). Edison took an exclamation and gave it a whole new meaning.
Which gets to the whole email/blog/comments thing. We still haven’t figured it out yet. A lot of yellers out there. A lot of anonymous screamers. And some thoughtful, friendly, helpful folks as well. There are also well-meaning people who appear clueless to others because their particular approach to a medium doesn’t match the approach they use.

I think this tells us something insightful about logos, though I’m not certain what it is.
I also think it tells us something even more insightful about names and experiences. I won’t forget, probably ever, the horrible way a flight attendant called Sigma treated me on a Northwest Airlines flight on Monday, but I honestly can’t remember their logo. And thirty years later, I still remember the incredibly nice people at the Cleveland Airport Hilton, but yes, I admit, it might have been a Sheraton.

Shark Attack!,"An innocent 14 year old girl lost her life just off the Florida panhandle the other day. That’s tragic news—it always is when something like this happens.
But why the panic?
Why the front page headlines in New York (no sharks here)? Why the emergency orders and the closed beaches?
Last year there were 30 shark attacks in Florida. This is fewer than the number of people killed by deer accidents (not deer attacks) in the United States. Fewer than the number of people killed in just a few hours of Labor Day traffic. Yet you don’t see people paying money to see movies about killer deer, or fretting about driving to see Aunt Sue.
Shark attackis likecancer.The phrase alone gets you to sit up and take notice, to have a sharp intake of breath, to hope that everything is okay.
Cancer kills about as many Americans as heart disease, but we react completely differently to news about a friend or a colleague with one disease or the other. We ostracize smokers but few people are serious enough about heart disease to become vegetarians… very different reactions to similar disease-causing lifestyle choices.
The new thing to be irrationally frightened of is terrorism. But of course, this isn’t a discussion about rational thought—it’s about worldview. For whatever reason, human beings are hyper-alert to certain things. We’re afraid of snakes and pit bulls, but not three wheeled go kart ATVs.
Awareness of worldview is critical in world affairs and in marketing as well (same thing, if you ask me). Books about dieting sell, butbooksabout avoiding heart disease don’t. Not because one book is inherently more valuable than the other, but because deep down, consumers believe that a book can help with losing weight (turns out it probably won’t) but a book on heart disease is probably not worth seeking out (big mistake).
One thing you can do as a marketer is rail against worldview. You can whine and complain that your service or product is better, pays for itself, saves lives, improves democracies, whatever. Whining, as we see over and over, has little impact.
For a while, an important corporate worldview revolved around quality. You could sell most anything under the cover of a story about improving ISO 9000/six sigma/Deming quality. Then we had the deep-seated desire (and big budgets) associated with the Y2K problem. Like most worldviews, this was a worldview that got there before most marketers arrived at the scene. Smart marketers used the opportunity to start a conversation and then tell a story and sell a product that companies actually needed in the long run—and turned that window into a long-term business. Others just manipulated the system and took the money and ran. Those guys are no longer around.
Same thing happened with web mania. The need to avoid the shark attack of missing the boat pushed change-resistant consumers and corporations to invest in all manner of web stuff. Some companies (like Yahoo!) turned that into a foundation for a real company. Others are long gone.
I don’t think I’m being harsh… I’ve seen far too many great ideas fail to believe that I’m being cynical in this post.You may have the greatest thing ever, but if it doesn’t match a prevailing worldview in the market where you hope to tell your story, you’re invisible.
All Marketers are Liarswas probably a dumb title for my latest book (if my goal was to sell a lot, fast). It doesn’t do a good job of matching the worldview of the people most likely to buy it or talk about it. Perhaps I should have called it, “The Orange Kangaroo: How Smart Marketers Tell Stories People Want to Believe.” Same book, different worldview. To be fair, my goal wasn’t to write a sequel, though, it was to change minds–which is a very time-consuming and difficult thing to do.
If you don’t have the energy or the time to change minds, though, what should you do? You need to realize that changing a worldview requires you to get your prospects to admit that they were wrong. This is awfully hard to do.
I think that tapping into a worldview almost always requires more than a new title or a new wrapper or a new ad. I think it requires rethinking the product itself, starting from scratch with the worldview in mind.
If you could start over, what story would you tell?
Various footnotes: On my way through security at LGA today, I saw a display that indicated it was against the law to carry on or pack mouse poison. Not sure why you’d want to do that, but I’m also not sure why it’s a bad idea to have it in your luggage. Could it be the “national security” worldview at work? Also worth noting that in just eight hours, the death toll in Rwanda was equal to the tragic enormity of the losses of 9/11. And this went on for 24 hours a day, for 100 days and almost no one noticed. Because of worldview. Also worth noting that according to Tom Peters, 100,000 Americans check into a hospital every year… and don’t check out. Because of infections or other illnesses caused by the system, not by their condition. There is no outcry, no big budgets. Because of worldview.","June 26, 2005","Shark Attack, Worldview, Marketing"

The four curves of want and get,"When you launch a product or service, you want A. A is a steep launch curve followed, after the dotted line, by a steep acceptance curve.
A is the curve of the hot knife through butter. A is the curve of big buzz. A is the curve of the unserved audience and the perfect product.
That’s what you want.
Usually, though, you get B.
B looks the same as A for a while. But then it stops.
B stops because your product isn’t for everybody. B stops because many products and services have a small but eager audience of early adopters, just itching to try something new. And then, once reality sets in, your idea stops spreading.
When I launched my ebook, I thought for a minute I had A. I sold a bazillion of them in one night. And then, bam, I had B. Sales slowed really fast. Why? Was it lousy? I don’t think it was. I think the audience of people who were standing by to buy an ebook from me was very connected to me and to each other, they heard about it right away, they bought it right away and then, there you go, the entire market was saturated.
Curve C is the most likely curve of success, not A. Curve C is the remarkable product that takes a while to find its footing. Then, the idea starts moving through communities and slowly builds, until, yes, this product is remarkable and you’ve got a hit.
Alas, soon after launch, there’s no way to tell C from D, is there? D is the curve of the dud. Most launches are duds. Not a lot you can do about it.
The challenges are pretty obvious. First, how do you decide where to put the dotted line? Second, how do you avoid killing something too early, or celebrating too early. And last, how do you know when to kill a dud? The odds are with those smart enough to launch something new tomorrow.","June 24, 2005","product launch, success curves, market saturation"

After that, though, it starts to get pretty tricky.The off-shore factory that makes the shoes you sell pays its employees the prevailing local wage, which is far less than the workers would make in your home town. You have leverage to move to another factory or try to change the system, but you don’t think Wal-Mart will pay you the premium you need to pay more for your sneakers.

Money equals power. Money flows via marketing, and it flows to organizations that provide goods and services that make us feel good.
But what happens when the non-delivered-non-product-based actions of those organizations start to impact the way we feel?Do consumers (industrial and individual) have an obligation to spend their cash in an ethically consistent way?
I have a valued business partner that creates products I’m ashamed of. What do I do now? Do I have an ethical obligation to change how I work in order to make my feelings clear? Do I have a marketing obligation?
What happens when consumers use the power of their money to make their feelings clear? What happens to Chick-fil-A or Bennetton when every purchase becomes a political act?
None of this used to matter very much. Corporations had far less power and were far less global. Their actions were more contained–you probably didn’t have programmers in three continents and factories on four. And the competition for dollars was much less severe.
Today, though, we’re seeing documentaries about the community-breaking power of a Wal-Mart. We hear about the hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks that oil companies manage to lobby for. And an oil spill or industrial disaster can wipe out big chunks of the environment.
To date, with the exception of easy (and juicy) black and white scandals, consumers of all stripes have been resistant to taking action with their dollars. Part of it is laziness, part of it is selfisness and part of it is a long history of a laissez faire disconnect between what we spend and what we believe.

Perhaps they’d do better in their careers or with their passions if they were better at conforming to human resource regulations… I don’t think so. It all comes down to spreading ideas. If you can get your art or your political cause or your restaurant’s ideas to spread, you win.
Somewhere along the way, people were sold that marketing [equals] advertising. Somewhere along the way, people were trained that marketers are liars (oops). And now we wonder why people are so clueless about what marketing really is. Maybe it’s because marketing has a marketing problem.
Marketing is not about trickery or even insincerity. It’s about spreading ideas that you believe in, sharing ideas you’re passionate about… and doing it with authenticity.

Great Enough!,"Perfect is the enemy of good.No doubt about it.
The excellent feedback I got from readers made it eminently clear that you agree with this sentiment. If you don’t ship, it’s not really worth doing. More important, we’ve only got a finite amount of time and resources to invest in anything (thanks, Chris Morris). The real issue is this: when do we stop working on something (because it’s good enough) and work on some other element of the offering.
When do we stop working on making a keyboard better and start working on the packaging or the promotion? When do we accept the status quo as unchangeable because the marketplace has embraced a standard, and then put our effort into less earthshattering, but presumably higher leverage tasks?
If you riff through your top 10 great successes of the last decade (you pick your field, doesn’t matter) aren’t most of them areas where someone refused to accept that the industry’s status quo wasn’t good enough, and instead set out to change a fundamental rule of that industry?

It almost feels churlish to complain.
But here’s the deal: almost everything is lousy.
Sure, it’s way way better than it was. Sure it’s a miracle.
But is anything as good as it could be?
Maybe a cup of Starbucks coffee or a Scharffenberger chocolate bar. But almost everything else needs a lot of work.
That canoe could be half the weight. There’s no reason to wait an hour to get on an airplane. Software development should be twice as fast at half the cost.
And what’s with the layout of this keyboard? They came up with a keyboard a century ago, decided it was good enough and then stopped! Holy Carpal Tunnel, Batman.
I’ve got a few posts worth on this topic, but here are my two big ideas to start:
1. Humans tend to work on a problem until they get a good enough solution, instead of a solution that’s right.
2. The marketplace often rewards solutions that are cheaper and good enough, instead of investing in the solution that promises to lead to the right answer.
This all sounds pessimistic. Are we doomed to inefficient products, unreliable computers, overpriced services and new devices that last for a while and then just plain break?
I don’t think so. I think that the open nature of the web and the hypercompetitive environment of worldwide competition are pushing things in two different directions at the same time. First, the hyper-cheap, sort of junky stuff that discounters and others want to sell in volume. And second, the relentless pursuit of better. (RPB). RPB is the opposite of good enough. It’s not Jack Welch’s six sigma nonsense in which engineers codify mediocrity. It’s a consistent posture of changing the rules on an ongoing basis.
David Neeleman, CEO of JetBlue, was talking today about the way he’s running the airline. By any measure, it’s good enough. Hey, it’s far and away the best airline the USA. But he’s not even close to settling. He riffed today about turning one out of three bathrooms on every one of his planes into a ladies only room. What a great idea. Low cost. Fast. And RPB.
I asked him why he doesn’t raise the price on the 20,000 flights they fly from New York to Florida (every day). If he raised it $10, he’d make an extra $11 million a year in profit! Without losing a customer.
He said, ""We could always do that later. Right now, it keeps us focused and hungry and efficient to do it for less.""",,"Good enough, relentless pursuit of better, innovation"

Lying and winking,"Jack and Meg of the White Stripes were on Fresh Air with Terri Gross today. You can find the link on their site:WhiteStripes.com.
What I loved about the interview was how aware Jack is of the stories he’s telling and how, more important, his audience is telling themselves a lie. He says he’s opposed to the preconceptions and the buzz and everything that has nothing to do with the music, and then spends hours and dollars creating preconceptions (is Meg his sister, his wife, both?), focusing on colors (there are only three, because three is a perfect number) and on and on.
Lots of artists are poseurs, acting out the lie to tell the story. And we love it. But Jack (Meg is basically mute, at least in public) was clearly enjoying his simultaneous roles of debunker and bunker.","June 9, 2005","Jack White, storytelling, preconceptions"
Journalists don’t always matter,"Not one, but two emails today asking about Apple’s switch to Intel. Both writers were sure that Apple had blown it (one works at Intel!) and wanted my take on how this changes Apple’s story. The thinking is that after years of telling people that they are better because they don’t use Intel, how can they change their story?
The problem with this analysis is that only geeks and journalists are listening to Apple’s story with that sort of clinical attention to detail. Ask ten typical Mac users and perhaps one can tell you which company made the old chip. Mac users don’t like Macs because of the chip. Far from it.
If the Mac looks the same and the mouse moves the same, they don’t care.
If Jobs is smart, he’ll use the increased heat efficiency and scale of the Intel chips to put more money into drop dead sexy cases for superlight laptops. That’s the story Mac users want to hear.",,"Apple, Intel, Mac users"
On being alert,"I posted the sequel (see the post below:Seth’s Blog: The first sequel to Knock Knock) and in three hours sold more copies of my ebook than I had in any single day over the last two weeks.

I could spend part of every single post hawking my new book (Amazon.com: Books: All Marketers Are Liars)and no doubt I’d lose readers. I’d also be bored.  But, surprisinglyenough, I’d sell more books, books to people who were glad to bereminded.

Treating people like they’re smart,"vs. treating them like they’re stupid.
Have you ever noticed that marketers repeat themselves a lot? That it’s not unusual to see 50 or 100 billboards for the same brand, or 30 or 50 promos for the same TV show?
Traditional media is filled with repetition. The more they tell us, the theory goes, the more likely we are to take action.
If you think about it, that means the marketer isn’t holding your decision making ability in very high esteem, is she? After all, a ""smart"" person ought to see an offer, make a decision and then move on. No need to repeat the offer, because he’s already decided.
Don’t interrupt that show to show me another promo for the series finale of Frasier. I mean, you just showed that to me an hour ago. Either I’m going to watch it or not!
Blogs are different. There’s a presumption of informed mature decision making. I come out with a new book, I mention it and then we all move on.
You’re smart. You can handle it.
How, then, do I explain the phenomenon that every time I mention a past post or an ebook or another blog, the traffic and the sales go up! Right away. A lot.
In fact, some of the biggest successes online have come from doing precisely that. AOL sent out more than 500,000,000,000 disks to people to get them join the service over the last decade. This was to an audience that was media-savvy, largely upper income and ostensibly smart.
Did you sign up the first time you got a CD? The second? The tenth?
What is it about (smart) people that makes them succumb to mindless repetition?
There’s a whole bunch of stuff that bloggers want you to do. They want you to buy stuff, read stuff, email about stuff and tell your friends about stuff. They are sorely tempted to use up their permission to talk to you by repeating themselves, because every time they do, the audience (that’s you) does what they are hoping for.
AOL annoyed everyone with their CDs. And then built a company worth many many billions of dollars on the back of that. Is annoying people worth it?
Most blogs have a center well of the ""new stuff"" and then links and ads along the sides. And it’s pretty sacrosanct that you put the repetitive stuff on the sides, while the center column is for the new, the stuff that people give you permission to say, the stuff that actually gets read.
A blogger in Switzerland reported that while her traffic keeps going up, her revenue from AdWords keeps going down. Why? Because she’s trained people to ignore the ads. The good stuff is in the center column, and we ignore the rest.
It’s only a matter of time before this dynamic gets wrecked. Advertising is insidious, because people are people. And people respond to interruption and repetition. The minute we stop doing that is the minute advertising stops wrecking the editorial process. I’m not going to hold my breath…

more on small,"What do you do once you realize the power of small? (tiny correction… eBay has more than 8,000 employees! That’s a lot of mouths to feed).
It’s one thing to say, ""yep, of course, small is the new big."" It’s quite another to actually do anything about it.
For the last six years, I’ve had exactly one employee. Me. This has changed my worklife in ways that I hadn’t predicted. The biggest changes are:
1. the kind of project that’s ""interesting"" is now very different. It doesn’t have to be strategic or scalable or profitable enough to feed an entire division. It just has to be interesting or fun or good for my audience.
2. the idea of risk is different as well. I can write an ebook and launch it in some crazy way and see what happens. I can build a dot com enterprise with a questionable business model and just see what happens. Because my costs are a whisker compared to a large organization, there’s just no comparison in the way I can approach something (compared to, say, a publisher).
Does this mean that little companies just do little things? Of course not.
Example: My friend Michael Cader (Publishers Lunch) has bootstrapped his tiny business into the single largest, most influential voice in the entire book publishing industry. When he needs help, he outsources it, probably to someone way too good and way too impatient to work for him or his competition. With a staff small enough to fit into a BMW, Cader has a business with a bigger circulation than the huge and fabledPublishers Weeklymagazine, owned by a conglomerate.
Is this only for writers and such? What about the solo builder I met who competes with giants by aggressively outsourcing his design and labor?
What about the architect down the street who tripled his income by leaving the huge firm and only taking on the high leverage assignments he actually enjoys?
Or the lawyer who left a giant firm, works half as much and enjoys it for the first time?
A dear friend of ours left her housewares sales firm and is now inventing things, getting them built in factories she doesn’t own and selling to retailers who are dying for innovative stuff that feels risky. She doesn’t take any risk at all… except her time, which is cheap now because she’s on her own.
One of the implications of the Long Tail is that you don’t know what’s going to work. That it’s easy to launch stuff, hard to figure out where it’s going to land. If you don’t have to bet the farm on every launch, you’re way more likely to launch more, and more randomly, which vastly increases your odds.
So, what do you do if you buy this? Quit.
Don’t grow unless it gives you joy.
Dare your employees to become freelancers instead.
Do it on a weekend until it doesn’t scare you quite so much.
It’s no longer about access to cash. Now it’s about choosing the right model and being remarkable.","June 6, 2005","small business, outsourcing, risk-taking"
Small is the new big,"Big used to matter. Big meant economies of scale. (You never hear about “economies of tiny” do you?) People, usually guys, often ex-Marines, wanted to be CEO of a big company. The Fortune 500 is where people went to make… a fortune.
There was a good reason for this. Value was added in ways that big organizations were good at. Value was added with efficient manufacturing, widespread distribution and very large R&D staffs. Value came from hundreds of operators standing by and from nine-figure TV ad budgets. Value came from a huge sales force.
Of course, it’s not just big organizations that added value. Big planes were better than small ones, because they were faster and more efficient. Big buildings were better than small ones because they facilitated communications and used downtown land quite efficiently. Bigger computers could handle more simultaneous users, as well.
Get Big Fast was the motto for startups, because big companies can go public and get more access to capital and use that capital to get even bigger. Big accounting firms were the place to go to get audited if you were a big company, because a big accounting firm could be trusted. Big law firms were the place to find the right lawyer, because big law firms were a one-stop shop.
And then small happened.
Enron (big) got audited by Andersen (big) and failed (big.) The World Trade Center was a target. TV advertising is collapsing so fast you can hear it. American Airlines (big) is getting creamed by Jet Blue (think small). BoingBoing (four people) has a readership growing a hundred times faster than theNew Yorker(hundreds of people).
Big computers are silly. They use lots of power and are not nearly as efficient as properly networked Dell boxes (at least that’s the way it works at Yahoo and Google). Big boom boxes are replaced by tiny ipod shuffles. (Yeah, I know big-screen tvs are the big thing. Can’t be right all the time).
I’m writing this on a laptop at a skateboard park… that added wifi for parents. Because they wanted to. It took them a few minutes and $50. No big meetings, corporate policies or feasibility studies. They just did it.
Today, little companies often make more money than big companies. Little churches grow faster than worldwide ones. Little jets are way faster (door to door) than big ones.
Today, Craigslist (18 employees) is the fourth most visited site according to some measures. They are partly owned by eBay (more than 4,000 employees) which hopes to stay in the same league, traffic-wise. They’re certainly not growing nearly as fast.
Small means the founder makes a far greater percentage of the customer interactions. Small means the founder is close to the decisions that matter and can make them, quickly.
Small is the new big because small gives you the flexibility to change the business model when your competition changes theirs.
Small means you can tell the truth on your blog.
Small means that you can answer email from your customers.
Small means that you will outsource the boring, low-impact stuff like manufacturing and shipping and billing and packing to others, while you keep the power because you invent the remarkable and tell stories to people who want to hear them.
A small law firm or accounting firm or ad agency is succeeding because they’re good, not because they’re big. So smart small companies are happy to hire them.
A small restaurant has an owner who greets you by name.
A small venture fund doesn’t have to fund big bad ideas in order to get capital doing work. They can make small investments in tiny companies with good (big) ideas.
A small church has a minister with the time to visit you in the hospital when you’re sick.
Is it better to be the head of Craigslist or the head of UPS?
Small is the new bigonlywhen the person running the small thinks big.

"We don’t have to care, part I","I don’t like traveling.
That said, my trip the other day set a new record. I chalk it up to the new ""We don’t care, we don’t have to"" economy. In many segments, so much profit has been squeezed out that there’s no room to hire and train great people. And there’s not enough competition to harm the bad actors.
I got to JFK with plenty of time. Good thing, too, because the parking lot next to the terminal is closed. The signs are optimistic, though, and point you to the relocated short term parking. Same crazy pricing, of course.
Well, it turns out that it takes half an hour on the bus to get from the parking to the terminal. They have half as many buses as they need, and at $24 a day, it’s not because they can’t afford it. It’s because they don’t have to care.
Got to American, an airline that gave up a long, long time ago. The line for security is 30 people long. But wait! there’s a sign that says, ""Business class, Gold, Platinum, etc."" I walk over to the sign. The harried woman checking boarding passes says, ""Go to the end of the line.""
""But there’s a sign.""
""I know there’s a sign. We ignore that.""
As I stand in line for ten minutes, I watch this act repeated with no less than ten people. It never occurs to the TSA or to American to take down the sign. They don’t care. They don’t have to.
I get on the plane. It hasn’t been refurbished in a decade or more. The seats are creaky. The flight costs more than ten times as much as JetBlue, but nothing about it remarkable in any way.

The magic word,"No, it’s not ""please.""
It’s ""ego.""
I meet a lot of confused marketers, and the primary cause of their confusion is that they believe that money equals motivation.
They believe that people will choose the best value.
That people will buy what they need.
That the best products and services will spread because they deserve to be talked about.
That employees can be persuaded to do things by paying them more and that consumers will buzz something if you reward them with cash.
This is true. Every once in a while.
It’s true for people who deep down equate money to ego. This tiny subset of the population really and truly keep score via cash. They are rare indeed.
We’re constantly on the lookout for someone’s real motivation. We don’t understand why someone would volunteer at a charity or take a lower-paying job or recommend a cool new CD or post something on their blog. ""What’s in it for them,"" we wonder. Here in the world capital of capitalism (yes, I just made that up…) Americans have fallen in love with the idea that money can feed the ego.
Almost all the time, that’s wrong.
Since this is a post about ego, let’s talk about… me. I smiled the other day when I read a review of my blog. It said(paraphrasing) ""Like many authors, Godin blogs to sell more books.""Wrong. Actually, I write books so that more people will read my blog!
I don’t blog to make money. I don’t run ads on my site. I don’t even blog to win awards. I blog because it pleases me to see my ideas spread. I like it when I see people talking about one of my ideas–without even mentioning where the idea came from. That means it’s the idea that spread, not my brand. Which is the whole point.
For me, anyway. Not for you or for her or for him.
And that’s the tricky part about marketing to ego. Everybody feeds their ego in a different way. The art is in telling a story that matches the ego-outlook (what I’ve called a worldview) of your target audience.

Where do you get your advice?,"According to todaysTimes,Al Gore turned to Johnny Carson for advice on his image and, yes, his jokes (Heeeeere’s Al, Thanks to Carson – New York Times.) Imagine how the world would be a different place if he had gotten (and used) better advice. Talk about leverage.
I’m stunned by how often corporations, organizations and individuals turn to celebrities for advice. We embrace diet books and tv shows and movie stars and well-known consulting firms and on and on, hoping for the glimmer of wisdom that will make a difference.
When I appear on the Motley Fool radio show, they ask me for my stock picks. Hey! I don’t own any stocks. And even if I did, what could I possibly have to say that would matter?
The thing about advice is that you need two things to make it work:1. it has to be good2. it has to motivate you to actually do something
The reason that people turn to celebrities and big organizations is that the patina of fame and authority makes it easier to sell yourself and your colleagues on taking action–on actually doing something with the advice.
If McKinsey said to close the plant, then it’s a lot easier to sell your board. If you had gotten precisely the same advice from precisely the same 26-year-old Harvard MBA but she’d been in your strategy group instead of at McKinsey, they’d ignore her.
The thing is, famous advice isn’t always better (it’s oftennotbetter, as we’ll see in a moment) and it’s more expensive and it allows you to beg off actually understanding what’s going on.
It’s not better because in order for the famous person to get to the point where she could give you advice, she had to fit through a number of filters. Johnny Carson was famous largely because he was consistent and inoffensive. You might believe that those are good characteristics in a politician, but George W. demonstrated that taking advice from an unknown Texan pre-felon named Karl Rove was far more effective at reaching his goals than relying on some tips from a comedian. That’s because Rove’s advice was better. Because Rove understood the dynamic of the political marketplace without compromise.
I think most organizations don’t buy nearly enough advice. They go 97% of the way, do 97% of the work, make all the investments… but then they get too tired and too stuck to actually do the high leverage stuff that works. So yes, buy advice. Buy a lot of it. But most important,understand why the advice is good advice, really understand the dynamic behind it–then you won’t have any trouble selling the idea, because it’s not the advice giver that matters… it’s the advice.

Advice for authors,"Always beware free advice. It is worth what it costs!
That said, I get a fair number of notes from well respected, intelligent people who are embarking on their first non-fiction book project. They tend to ask very similar questions, so I thought I’d go ahead and put down my five big ideas in one place to make it easier for everyone.
I guarantee you that you won’t agree with all of them, but, as they say, your mileage may vary.
1. Please understand that book publishing is an organized hobby, not a business.The return on equity and return on time for authors and for publishers is horrendous. If you’re doing it for the money, you’re going to be disappointed.
On the other hand, a book gives you leverage to spread an idea and a brand far and wide. There’s a worldview that’s quite common that says that people who write books know what they are talking about and that a book confers some sort of authority.
2. The timeframe for the launch of books has gone from silly to unrealistic.When the world moved more slowly, waiting more than a year for a book to come out was not great, but tolerable. Today, even though all other media has accelerated rapidly, books still take a year or more. You need to consider what the shelf life of your idea is.
3. There is no such thing as effective book promotion by a book publisher.This isn’t true, of course. Harry Potter gets promoted. So did Freakonomics. But out of the 75,000 titles published last year in the US alone, I figure 100 were effectively promoted by the publishers. This leaves a pretty big gap.
This gap is either unfilled, in which case the book fails, or it is filled by the author. Here’s the thing: publishing a book is really nothing but a socially acceptable opportunity to promote yourself and your ideas far and wide and often.
If you don’t promote it, no one will. If you don’t have a better strategy than, “Let’s get on Oprah” you should stop now. If you don’t have an asset already–a permission base of thousands or tens of thousands of people, a popular blog, thousands of employees, a personal relationship with Willard Scott… then it’s too late to start building that asset once you start working on a book.
By the way, blurbs don’t sell books. Not really. You can get all the blurbs in the world for your book and it won’t help if you haven’t done everything else (quick aside: the guy who invented the word “blurb” also wrote the poem Purple Cow).
4. Books cost money and require the user to read them for the idea to spread.Obvious, sure, but real problems. Real problems because the cost of a book introduces friction to your idea. It makes the idea spread much much more slowly than an online meme because in order for it to spread, someone has to buy it. Add to that the growing (and sad) fact that people hate to read. Too often, people have told me, with pride, that they read three chapters of my book. Just three.
5. Publishing is like venture capital, not like printing.Printing your own book is very very easy and not particularly expensive. You can hire professional copyeditors and designers and end up with a book that looks just like one from Random House. That’s easy stuff.
What Random House and others do is invest. They invest cash in an advance. They invest time in creating the book itself and selling it in and they invest more cash in printing books. Like all VCs, they want a big return.
If you need the advance to live on, then publishers serve an essential function. If, on the other hand, you’re like most non-fiction authors and spreading the idea is worth more than the advance, you may not.
So, what’s my best advice?
Build an asset. Large numbers of influential people who read your blog or read your emails or watch your TV show or love your restaurant or or or…
Then, put your idea into a format where it will spread fast. That could be an ebook (a free one) or a pamphlet (a cheap one–the Joy of Jello sold millions and millions of copies at a dollar or less).
Then, if your idea catches on, you can sell the souvenir edition. The book. The thing people keep on their shelf or lend out or get from the library. Books are wonderful (I own too many!) but they’re not necessarily the best vessel for spreading your idea.
And the punchline, of course, is that if you do all these things, you won’t need a publisher. And that’s exactly when a publisher will want you! That’s the sort of author publishers do the best with.

The good news is that while it’s almost impossible to blow people away with an ad campaign or a coupon or even a product, the bar is set so astonishingly low for managers that it’s pretty easy to blow people away by enabling your staff to be amazing, honest and happy at the same time.

Old media collides with the new (an ongoing series),"Wired magazine is owned by Conde Nast, the magazine giant.
Wired has a priceless double opt in permission email list. It’s a great list of forward thinking people who actually WANT to hear from Wired.
If you wanted to make some short term cash, maybe to hit your budget numbers, you could sell/rent that list. You could probably articulate some sort of rationalization, point out the terms of service or the privacy policy, but no matter what, you’d be doing something short-term and stupid. Sending a car ad to this list serves only one purpose: to benefit the sender, not the recipient.

Inside and Outside,"It’s true. I rarely walk into a Starbucks without my laptop. Not because I need a laptop to enjoy Starbucks, but because I need a Starbucks to use the web.
I found myself with a few minutes to kill while a friend was shopping this weekend, and next thing I knew, I was in a Starbucks with no laptop. Totally different deal. Very zen.
Anyway, on the way in I overheard a conversation (okay, I was eavesdropping, but it was on your behalf). Three 20 somethings who worked at the fast food place next door were whining about their jobs. Two were talking about how horrible it was to ""open."" The third admitted that he liked to open, because then he didn’t have to deal with the &#&$ customers. After about a minute of the detailed complaints, I had had enough and went inside.
Inside the Starbucks, the first thing I noticed, tucked deep in the corner, not for customer inspection, apparently, was a bulletin board. The bulletin board was jammed with pictures of the staff. The staff on a picnic. The staff at an amusement park. The staff kidding around.
That very same staff was working behind the counter. If it’s possible to make an herbal tea with enthusiasm, they were doing it. If it’s possible to make a $4 transaction feel joyful, they accomplished it.
Okay, the obvious thing here is thatthisis the Starbucks marketing effort, almost in its entirety. They don’t advertise, they don’t launch new products every day, but they are selling the way it makes you feel to purchase something there. And I have to tell you, it made me feel great.
The less obvious thing is that the folks behind the counter weren’t making this up. It wasn’t inauthentic. They haddecidedto enjoy their jobs, theywereenjoying their jobs and it was helping not just Starbucks, but it helped them, too. All I had to do was glance out the window to see the difference.
I think there’s a huge lesson here. Not just for marketers who sell interactions (that means everyone except for maybe commodity steel producers) but for employees too.","July 20, 2005","Starbucks, employee engagement, customer experience"
Coincidences,"Do you believe in cosmic fate and coincidences?
You may recall that a few months ago, I posted the picture of someone who looked an awful lot like me (Seth’s Blog: Everybody has a doppelganger) So much so that my wife thought it was my picture.
I had never heard of Robert–the picture came from a reader. And that was the end of that.
Until TED last week in Oxford. I entered the auditorium pretty late, and there was just one open seat. I ""excused me""d my way to the center and sat down, in the dark. When the lights came up, I looked over to the person sitting next to me, and asked, ""Have we met?""
It took us a few minutes, but, you guessed it, it was Robert.
So, was this an amazing coincidence? I mean, what are the chances? One picture posted of a twin in the history of my blog. One seat at Ted…
Of course, that’s the wrong question.
There are a million places I could have had the amazing coincidence of meeting Robert. There are a million people who could have been in the seat next to me that would have amazed me.
It’s only amazing when a coincidence occurs that you predicted BEFORE it happens. If it seems unlikely afterward, it’s just your brain telling you a story. What are the odds of winning the lottery twice? The same as winning it once… IF you start keeping track after you’ve won the first time. The lottery doesn’t know you already won the first time.
As for Robert, he is erudite, wicked smart and doing important work. It’s flattering to be mistaken for him.
PS Nick Davis sends us this fabulous quote:

"Thank you, Bob Cocksedge, for teaching all of us","I met the chief designer for Nokia at Ted. Marko is a great guy, but it was fascinating to watch the interactions he had with people. Every single person he met came up to him, pulled out a cellphone and began whining. Mostly, though, people didn’t hate their phones. They hated their carrier.
I know. I hate T Mobile.
My annoyance at my carrier didn’t decrease when I had to pay not once, but twice to buy a four day online pass to use the Net in my hotel. Sitting at the airport waiting to fly home, a few shekels left on my British phone card, I decided to take a whirl and called the hard-to-find customer service number for T Mobile, figuring I’d try to get a refund for the first $60 Net pass I purchased but that didn’t work (Hah! I thought. Hah! I can hear you thinking).
Bob Cocksedge answered my call. On the third ring. He was intelligent, thoughtful, even kind. He apologized for taking a while, using their antiquated database. He never found the purchase, but he emailed me the contact info for his manager so I can submit the transaction number once I got my credit card info at home.
You’ve already guessed the lesson. It only took Bob a few minutes. It didn’t cost T Mobile much of anything at all compared to leaving me on hold and then being rude to me. But for a tiny tiny fraction of the cost of one of those full page ads that they buy every day, T Mobile actually built their brand.
I’ve said it before–your call center is probably the single cheapest investment you can make in building your consumer or business to business brand among customers and motivated prospects.
Thanks, Bob, for reminding me.","July 15, 2005","Customer service, T Mobile, Brand building"
Before you spend a lot of time and money on a logo,"Before you go in circles trying to get those spirals just right…
go take a look atLogo Design by Pixellogo� – All Logo Designs.
I’m not proposing that you should spend $50 or whatever to buy a stock logo.
What I hope you’ll see is that all a logo needs is to be GOOD ENOUGH (I know, I’m the guy who says good enough is a curse). Why is it okay to have a non-wonderful logo? Because the logo is just a placeholder. It gains value AFTER it hits the world, because people associate things with it.
Imagine a classroom in 1912 with kids named Elvis, Ronald, Margaret, Donald and  Madonna in it. You wouldn’t know who to make fun of first. It seems as though the abstract quality of a name or a logo (both blank slates) is not as important as what you do with it.
This advice doesn’t hold for non-abstract names or images, naturally. But those are worth less, in my humble opinion.
All that said, the logo for my secret summer project is truly awesome. Thanks, Aaron, for the inspired work. (I’ll post the logo in early August, prolonging the tension as long as possible.)",,"logo design, placeholder, branding"
No such thing as side effects,"Barry Schwartz pointed out to me today that I shouldn’t talk about side effects.Marketers who are inauthentic and shortsighted hide the side effects of their products from purchasers. This fraudulent behavior inevitably comes back to haunt.But Barry points out that these aren’t side effects. There’s only effects. When you make something or sell somthing, it affects the world around it. Some of those effects are things you want. The others, the negative ones, are unintended, but they are still real.These bad effects are just as important as the good ones. And smart marketers are honest about them.","July 14, 2005","side effects, transparency, marketing ethics"

The rage of the copyeditor,"Before a book gets published by a mainstream publisher, your editor will send it to a copyeditor. His job is to go through the manuscript and highlight errors in grammar, consistency and spelling.
I’ve worked with quite a few copyeditors in my time, and it’s interesting to note how often they seem to get very angry.
Let’s say you’ve written a 300 page book on packaged goods, and 32 times in the manuscript you’ve spelled ""Procter & Gamble"" as ""Proctor and Gamble."" The computer-friendly thing to do is leave a note at the front that says, ""please do a global search and replace and fix it"". Instead, copyeditor convention requires that each one be marked.
The first few marks are normal. But then, after five or six or seven corrections, the ink gets a little darker. It’s almost as though the copyeditor is saying, ""I’ve already corrected this SIX TIMES. WHY AREN’T YOU LISTENING??!""  By the end of the manuscript, the copyeditor’s monologue has gone on so long, the anger has turned into rage.
With that in mind, I show you two pictures.
Here’s the sign on a pub in Oxford. I imagine that at first there was a little sign that said, ""no cards."" But a few people tried to pay with cards anyway, so the sign got bigger. And then one or two people tried to pay with cards anyway. Eventually, it must have led to this.
Do you really think that yelling at his prospects is helping his business?
It’s not my fault that the 5,000 people before me asked if they could use a credit card. Don’t yell at me. Yell at them. Of course, they’re not here!
Has the number of people asking to use a credit card gone down since the owner added AT ALL?
If your goal is to attract and acquire new customers, yelling appears to be a silly strategy.
Compare this to a sign at the beautiful Museum of Natural History just down the street.

Seth’s new car (you can help make it real),"So, the #1 cause of death among teenagers in the developed world is the car.
You can get hit by a car, but you're more likely to die driving a car or being a passenger in a car driven by a friend.  Many boomers have teenagers or are about to.  And boomers, as we know, intend to live forever, expect to have their families live forever, and are often happy to pay to ensure that this actually happens.
So, here's what we need:  A car for teenagers.
It is, after all, a matter of life and death.
A car for teenagers is very different than a car for everyone else. The biggest reason is that a car for teenagers is rarely purchased by a teenager, so a third party (probably the parent) has a lot of leverage over what the car actually does.
So, what does a parent want?Low poweredCheapGreat gas mileage (more cheap)
And a teenager?
Funky lookingAllows easy attachment/customization of side panelsNot embarrassing!
Requires breathalyzer test to startEasy to set, hard to hack speed limiterConstant GPS reporting via wimax or cellphone, allowing the owner of the car to see where it isLocation lock out, making it easy for the owner to set the range of the vehicle or the roads traveled
[bonus added later: locks out texting or cell phone calling when the car is moving]
All this technology is easy to sync by computer or phone
Lots of airbagsID card key making it easy to charge the driver per use, treat different drivers differently, including usage time.
Obviously, this goes against everything that the US-Marlboro-Man-wild-west-transport-equals-freedom-equals-macho-equals-personal-responsibility meme that is at the heart of the US car market. So what? There are already plenty of cars that fit right into that mental model. Like a 1964.5 Mustang with original pony interior. Fine! If a 17 year old wants to buy one of those, she can.
But it's easy to imagine, isn't it, that boomers would buy 50,000 of these $20,000 cars every year? That's a billion dollars a year!  So why don't we have one yet? I think it's because the worldview of Detroit and the rest of the car industry is very much about incremental improvement of technology combined with surface styling innovation, not about reinventing what people might discover that they very much want.
So, if you know someone in the car business, tell them I'm ready to order one in 2011. In purple.",,"teenage car, safety features, parental control"
Stuck (with a bump on the head),"Steven Levitt spoke at TED today. He told the story of the car seats, and it’s worth a quick rehash.
Turns out that car seats for kids over 2 are no more effective than seat belts. The data is unequivocal on this. (see a quick clip atFreakonomics)
So if it’s so clear, and if it means that Americans are wasting $300 million a year on car seats, what’s going on?
Why is it that in New York State it’s a crime to put a six year old in the backseat of your car with just a seatbelt? A crime!
Why is it that when I passed a motorist strapping his four year old into the back of his BMW in London yesterday, I almost stopped and yelled at him? Or at least gently pointed out the safety problem?
It goes to stories. It feels like you’re doing something smart and thoughtful and caring for your child. The effort gives the parent peace of mind and joy.

Byron’s gone,"About twenty years ago, I met a guy named Byron Preiss. I was 24 and just starting out at Spinnaker Software and he was the supremely talented, very smart packager that my boss had just purchased several million dollars worth of software from.
Turns out that Byron was only seven years older than me.
We worked closely together for two years, arguing nearly every day about the products we ended up creating together. We worked with Arthur C. Clarke and Ray Bradbury and artists and writers and programmers. In 1985, it was a very new deal to be a packager of content, to work with brands and carve out new rights, to imagine new forms of media. Byron was doing all of those things.
One day, Byron said to me, ""You should go out on your own. I’ll help you. I’ll introduce you to people."" Byron not only demonstrated to me that the new media enabled the individual to make stuff, but he gave me permission to try.

On Whale Oil,"Several hundred years ago, a huge piece of the economy of the Netherlands was based on whale oil. This oil painting gives you a small glimpse of what an industry this was.
No question, those in charge believed that whale oil would never run out, and that if some sort of legislation or new world order came along that threatened the supply of dead whales, they would fight it–the very survival of their families were at stake.
Whale oil, of course, is long gone. And the Netherlands are still here, better than ever.
Some of the whale oil magnates and whale oil processors and whale oil catering guys in the silver trucks (okay, maybe they didn’t have silver trucks) got while the getting was good. They learned how to do something else once they saw the industry begin to decay. They took their assets–their capital, their leverage, their training–and used it to get a headstart doing some other mercantile activity. And they thrived as a result.
We’re in the middle of the biggest shift(s) of the last century–whole industries are disappearing, worldviews are changing and the rules are being rewritten. One thing I’ve noticed in Amsterdam (I spoke to about 400 entrepreneurs yesterday, not all of them young, not all of them independent, not all of them homogeneous) is that there’s a real bias for action here. People here are itching to get on to the next thing. That and I couldn’t find any whale oil for sale. Not one drop.",,"whale oil, industry shift, entrepreneurship"

Last night I saw the concluding episode of the Michael Peterson ‘Death on the Staircase’ trial in the US (Durham). This morning I read your ‘Liar’s Blog’ and it got me thinking. It seems to me that the prosecution told stories that matched the worldview of the jury. The defence however seemed to focus on the facts. Who won? The story tellers! Even the prosecutions own witnesses told stories. The defence pretty much refuted everything the prosecution came up with. It’s not just marketers and politicians who are liars. I understand that stories are acceptable for marketing ?? we all expect that. But should it work in court too? Why can’t a judge assess whether a lawyer is ‘marketing’ to the jury? It seems that the media are driving lawyers toward a marketing approach to justice. To focus purely on facts is to risk losing the case.

On uniforms,"Let me assert for a moment that marketing is about storytelling (hence the Liars book). If you’re telling a story, though, that means that in some sense you’re an actor. Not that you’re con artist or doing something fraudulent… far from it. But that you’re an actor in that you are using emotion and amplification of ideas to make your point in a limited amount of time.
Actors do better when they wear costumes.
And at work, a costume is called a uniform.
Would a cop be as effective at keeping the peace if she was wearing jeans and flip flops? What about a surgeon in a bathrobe? Sure, they need to wear something in the operating room, but don’t try to persuade me that scrubs are just for utlity. It makes you more confident to know that they’re dressing special in order to cut you open.
So, fast food places are pretty good at getting people to wear uniforms, but what about where you work? Why don’t accountants or web designers or direct marketers wear uniforms to meetings? Not the bland invisible suit/dockers/gap uniform, but a real uniform?
For my new secret project, we’re going to buy uniforms fromCrooked Brook.

"Who’s side are you on, anyway?","At 4 am in the morning, it’s easy to be defensive.
I’m staying at the Kimpton Prescott in SF tonight, and, being unable to switch time zones, I’m awake. Have been for hours.
At 4 am, I went down to the front desk and asked to use the fitness room. When I checked in last night, I was told that the room opened at 6 am, but because the website says:
On-site free 24-hour fitness facility with state of the art cardiovascular equipment, Universal gym …
They’d make an exception and let me in.
So, early this morning, I presented myself to the night clerk and asked him to let me in.
Now, it would be easy for him to get defensive. He could quote policy at me, point out that he’d worked there two years and had never let anyone in, etc. For a brief moment, I felt the impulse pass through him.
Then he realized that there was a better way, an easier way, a way that didn’t require him to exert negative emotional energy in the middle of the night. He switched sides.
He became an advocate for my cause. He said, “Well, I’ve never done that before, but if that’s what the website said, let’s see if we can make this work.” Notice the “we.”
He called the bellman, explained what we needed. If the bellman pointed out it was impossible, it would be easy for me to trudge upstairs, foiled but not defeated, unexercised but not disrespected.
The good news was that the room was easy to open. The better news is that even though customers (and prospects) can be a real pain in the neck, everyone in the organization that wants customers on a regular basis needs to take a breath and realize that we’realwayson the same side. The challenge (and the benefit) is in acting that way.

Lots of publishing news today,"Some of it worth a comment.
Amazon launches a short story series with well-known authors selling digital short pieces. (reveries – cool news of the day.) I was asked by Amazon to jump in and I declined. The reasoning at their end is simple: they should be a publisher. They have every element necessary to be a successful publisher:a. access to readers who want to hear from themb. knowledge of what those readers wantc. infinite shelf spaced. cash to act as a VC for authors who demand upfront money
Barnes & Noble is secretly making a fortune as a publisher (check out the front of the retail store next time you’re there) and Amazon is way, way bigger.
Alas, I thinkdigitaland I thinkshortare the two worst ways to start. The first two ways you know if you want to buy a book is to either read part of it or hear about it from a friend. Well, if it’s short and you read part of it, you’re done. And if it’s digital, your friend ought to just send it to you.
The third way to decide you want a book is that the author is someone you know and trust. But if that’s the only thing a publisher has to offer (the famous author) then the author gets most of the money in her advance, because, after all, it’s her brand not the publisher’s that’s selling the thing. Lots of online platforms are facing this very same challenge.
I’ve been pushing Amazon to become of a publisher of just about everything for five or six years now. Alas, I’m dubious about the success of this effort. I hope they don’t give up when it doesn’t take off.
The second thing is theNew York Timespiece that seems to think that free ebooks were just invented and might be the next big thing. Longtime readers will be surprised at this insight. Try this Google link to see what I mean: (ideavirus – Google Search.)
The third article also comes from theTimes.Once a Booming Market, Educational Software for the PC Takes a Nose Dive – New York Times. It talks about the death of the educational software market. That was my very first job, in 1984, with Spinnaker Software, the firm widely credited with inventing the educational computer game. It was a very exciting time. The company grew 10x a year, and suddenly this was a real industry.
Like most industries, everyone thought it would last forever. It didn’t. They don’t. Yours probably won’t either.",,"Amazon, publishing, educational software"
The Big Moo ([poetically] reviewed),"A co-author passed on this note to me:
WOW, three days in the moo pasture and I’m in love….I feel in thespotlight, not my spotlight, but the spotlight of innovation–remarkable possibilities– in the making.
You spoke it and I took the message with me to [my Fortune 100 company]“There is freedom to innovatively use the book/tour for any purpose”….the implicitmessage: Let’s have fun in that discovery process. What would it meanfor us to be involved…what a fun question that is. Big Moo, bydefinition, is FUN….
Now I don’t know Seth (in fact know little about him) except that thebook’s very nature is contagious. And — it’s about connectivity(yours-mine-the authors- the sponsors- the world!) Invitingsponsorship “to combine forces…to contribute, connect and celebrate”.
And look at what has happened in so little time: you invited me intothis…and now I am connected…and inside this celebration in the making.Now that’s contagious. All from a little book…who would haveguessed….I can’t wait to reread it again and again. I am so excitedabout what might, could, will unfold as a result of all this. ThankYOU for inviting me in. Thank you for the gift;  inspiration is theprize, the gift.
If I were a cow, I might just moooooooooooo.

What Bootsy said,"Here’s some profound marketing thought fromBootsy Collins.
""You have to bring some funk to get some. You just can’t walk in a place and expect to get some funk. If you ain’t bring no funk, then you can’t get no funk… Another thing is, you can’t fake the funk or your nose will grow.""",,"Bootsy Collins, funk, marketing"
The best thing I never said,"Mike Sellers (Terra Nova: Fun Is What You Make It) quotes me:
Seth Godin said something like ""the good news is, everyone’s visible online. The bad news is, we’re all three inches tall.""
Thing is, I love this quote. It’s the sort of thing I wish I had said. And in fact, I’m going to start saying it. However, to be fair, I can’t find the quote on Google or in my files. It seems like the sort of thing Lisa Gansky would have put on a t shirt in the old days.
So, if you know who really said it (even if it was me), please let me know. Am I getting old or is it my imagination?","August 19, 2005","visibility, quote, self-reflection"
Hurry!,"There are two ways to catch a plane. The first, which happens to be the most common, is to leave on time, do your best to park nearby, repeatedly glance at your watch, and then start moving faster and faster. By the time you get to security, you realize that you’re quite late, so you cut the line (""My plane leaves in 10 minutes!"" you shout). You walk fast. As you get closer to your gate, you realize that walking fast isn’t going to work, so you start to jog. Three gates away, you break into a run, and if you’re lucky, you barely make the flight.
The second way is to leave for the airport 10 minutes early.
The easiest way to deal with change and with all the anxieties that go with it is not to deal with it at all. The easiest thing to do is to allow the urgency of the situation to force us to make the decisions (or take the actions) that we’d rather not take. Why? Because then we don’t have to take responsibility for what happens. The situation is at fault, not us. The beauty of the asymptotic curve is that at every step along the way, running ever faster for the plane is totally justified. The closer we get, the more we’ve invested ourselves. The more we invest in making our flight, the easier it is to justify running like a lunatic to make it.
Years ago, I published a directory of law firms. No fewer than 70% of the firms sent their payment the night before it was due, by FedEx. Eight of the firms sent their payment by messenger–at an expense that was equal to about 10% of the entire cost of their listing. Obviously, there was no need to waste all that money. Law firms spend millions every year on last-minute deliveries because, like most of us, they confuse urgent with important.
Urgent issues are easy to address. They are the ones that get everyone in the room for the final go-ahead. They are the ones we need to decide on right now, before it’s too late.
How can you tell if you’re too obsessed with urgent?
Do senior people at your company refuse to involve themselves in decisions until the last minute?
Do meetings regularly get canceled because something else came up?
Is waiting until the last minute the easiest way to get a final decision from your peers?
Smart organizations ignore the urgent. Smart organizations understand that important issues are the ones to deal with. If you focus on the important stuff, the urgent will take care of itself.
A key corollary to this principle is the idea that if you don’t have the time to do it right, there’s no way in the world you’ll find the time to do it over. Too often, we use the urgent as an excuse for shoddy work or sloppy decision-making. A quick look at Washington politics (under any administration) is an easy way to understand how common this crutch is. No responsible business (or diligent family) would spend money and resources the way our government does when faced with an ""emergency."" Urgent is not an excuse. In fact, urgent is often an indictment–a sure sign that you’ve been putting off the important stuff until it mushrooms out of control.
The most important idea of all is this one: You will succeed in the face of change when you make the difficult decisions first. It’s easy to justify running for your plane when it’s leaving in two minutes and you’re only five gates away. It’s much harder to justify waking up 10 minutes early to avoid the problem altogether. Alas, waking up early is the efficient, effective way to deal with the challenge. Waking up earlier may seem foolish to the person lying in bed next to you, but when you enjoy the benefits of a pleasant stroll to the gate, you realize that your difficult decision was a good one.
Organizations manage to justify draconian measures–laying people off, declaring bankruptcy, stiffing their suppliers, and closing stores–by pointing out the urgency of the situation. They refuse to make the difficult decisions when the difficult decisions are cheap. They don’t want to expend the effort to respond to their competition or fire the intransigent VP of development. Instead, they focus on the events that are urgent at that moment and let the important stuff slide.
A quick look at the gradually failing airlines, retailers, and restaurant chains we all know about confirms this analysis. They’re all content to worry about today’s emergency, setting the stage for tomorrow’s disaster. Better, I think, to wake up 10 minutes early, make some difficult decisions before breakfast, and enjoy the rest of your day.

Clueless,"We’re all clueless. That’s the best word I can use to describe the state of the art of marketing.
Three examples:
I’m at the supermarket yesterday. I run into my friend John, not someone I often see at the Food Emporium. John has a list. Standard grocery list, ""here honey, please go out and get this…"" But John wants to show me something on the list. It says,1 woman’s razor that matches our bathroom.
Wow. Gillette has been making razors for almost a hundred years, and you wonder how many hours and how much money they’ve spent trying to answer that want… probably .0001% of what they spend on blade technology.
Then, this morning, I head to the bank. Poor guy is arguing with the ""customer service manager"". The problem? He had $4 in his checking account as he was waiting to close it. The bank charged him a monthly $5 service fee. The fee bounced. Then they charged him $30 for bouncing the fee on an inactive account.
The manager was trying to explain the policy, but the bottom line is that all the real estate, all the ads, all the marble, all the computers… all wasted… because they were enraging the guy. Over $4.
And finally, leaving the bank, I saw the most amazing interaction (yes, this is true.) A woman is first in line. She’s withdrawing $1,000 from her account. The teller pushes away from the desk and goes and gets her signature card (this is a neighborhood bank) to match it against the woman’s signature on the withdrawal slip.
The customer tells me that:1. the teller has been working there for twenty years.2. the customer comes in at least once a week.3. they always check her signatureand, ready for this…4. she’s been a customer at this bank forseventy years. I am not making this up. She is very proud that she’s nearly (nearly!) their longest-serving customer. The account is more than seventy years old. And they check her signature.
Clueless.

Will you help us?,"In eight weeks, my last traditional book project hits the street.
I have 32 co-authors this time and 100% of our royalties go to charity.
This time, we’re shooting for the big time. And we need your help.
The book is called:The Big Mooby The Group of 33. Our goal is to sell a million copies before the end of the year and to raise millions for three worthy charities. Our bigger goal is to transform thousands of organizations–corporations, non-profits, community groups, whatever.
Here’s where you come in.
I’ve found that most business books don’t get bought. Those that do, don’t get read. Those that do, make a difference, but only for those that read them. Every once in a while, a business book breaks through because organizations buy it by the truckoad. When a group buys 100 or 1,000 copies of a book, it gets talked about. It becomes a touchstone, something that people can refer to, use as a shorthand and take as a common foundation.
When I pitched Tom Peters, Malcolm Gladwell, Guy Kawasaki, April Armstrong, Julie Anixter, Marcia Hart and dozens of other big thinkers on contributing to a book that was designed to change the way organizations dealt with being remarkable, they all saidyes.No hesitation, justyes.
Now it’s your turn to say, ""yes.""
For the first time that I’m aware of, we’re selling the galleys to a book. The galley is the very expensive pre-publication not-quite-paperback version of a hardcover book. The galley is created to give reviewers a chance to read the book before everyone else. I persuaded my publisher to print 10,000 galleys, a huge number. And we’re selling them at cost.
Here’s the catch: I only want tosellthe galleys (50 at a time) to people who will give them to people who will buy a lot of the $15 hardcover. (Sell isn’t really accurate. The fine print is that we’re actually giving them away, but you need to spend $100 on postage and handling to get them… we promise to handle them very carefully.)
That’s complicated, so I’ll type it slowly:
I only want to give the 50 pack of galleys ($2 a copy s&h) to people who will turn around and give galleys to people in organizations with the will and the ability to pre-order a dozen or more copies of the final hardcover.
This means that if you buy a bunch of galleys and give them to people who don’t do anything, you’ve killed the project and turned me into a publishing pariah.
If, on the other hand, I’m right and every galley turns into 10 or a hundred pre-sales, we just hit a home run.
So, there’s only 100 or so sets of these galleys left (my co-authors bought most of them to distribute) so I apologize in advance if Jack at 800 CEO READ runs out. If he does, don’t despair… just pre-order the hardcover. Not for me, for you. For you and your organization and your friends and our charities.
Here’s that address again:The Big Mooby The Group of 33.* Pleasedon’torder a set unless you know the right sneezers/connectors/influencers. And thanks.
*At the site above, you can order galleys, pre-order the hardcoverfrom various sites, see the bios of the authors and read about ourcharities. (Did I mention that Hugh Macleod is doing the illustrations?)","August 14, 2005","charity, business book, crowdfunding"
The problem with lawyers (part of an ongoing series),"This site featuring cheesy furniture (FedexFurniture.Com) would have essentially no traffic–except for the fact that Fedex sent a cease and desist letter and claimed it violated the DCMA (that and Kinko’s refused to print cards for the site’s owner, because, of course, they’re owned by Fedex!)
No, it probably won’t hurt Fedex’s business, but it’s sure not worth the hassle, is it?","August 11, 2005","lawyers, cease and desist, FedexFurniture.Com"
Let’s just say the unlikely happens,"And Hollywood and the music guys manage to sue the users and organizers of online file sharing out of business. Let’s imagine that against all odds, you can’t find copyrighted stuff online any more.
If that happens, sites likeibiblio – Sights and Soundsbegin to do better and better. Here’s hours and hours of stuff for free.
Now what you end up with paid online radio and free online radio. Paid online video and free online video.
At first, the paid stuff is good and the free stuff is less good.
But soon, producers seeking an audience start to make their stuff free. Because when they do, the audience goes up 100x.
And then, in order to compete, others do the same thing. Wouldn’t you if you had a touring band? Wouldn’t you if you had already exhausted your DVD sales and wanted a big enough audience for your sequel?
And then, of course, we end up where we sort of are today.","August 10, 2005","file sharing, online content, free vs. paid media"
